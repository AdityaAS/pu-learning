-!- FUNCTION: May be part of an oligomeric complex which is likely to
    have a transport or channel function in the erythrocyte membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Restricted to tissues or cell lines expressing
    erythroid characters.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: RhCE and RhD are responsible for the RH blood group
    system. The molecular basis of the E=Rh3/e=Rh5 blood group
    antigens is a single variation in position 225; Pro-225
    corresponds to Rh3 and Ala-225 to Rh5. The molecular basis of the
    C=Rh2/c=Rh4 blood group antigens is a single variation in position
    102; Ser-102 corresponds to Rh2 and Pro-102 to Rh4.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Rh family.
