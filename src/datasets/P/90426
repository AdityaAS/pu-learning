Lantibiotic gallidermin precursor.
"Structural gene isolation and prepeptide sequence of gallidermin, a
new lanthionine containing antibiotic.";
"Gallidermin: a new lanthionine-containing polypeptide antibiotic.";
"The solution structure of the lantibiotic gallidermin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic)
    active on Gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal activity of
    lantibiotics is based on depolarization of energized bacterial
    cytoplasmic membranes, initiated by the formation of aqueous
    transmembrane pores.
-!- PTM: Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of
    Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether
    bonds with cysteine. The C-terminal lanthionine undergoes
    decarboxylation. This is followed by membrane translocation and
    cleavage of the modified precursor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type A lantibiotic family.
