AC   P26382;
Fructose permease IID component (PTS system fructose-specific EIID
component) (EIID-Fru) (p30).
"Levanase operon of Bacillus subtilis includes a fructose-specific
phosphotransferase system regulating the expression of the operon.";
"A 23911 bp region of the Bacillus subtilis genome comprising genes
located upstream and downstream of the lev operon.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in fructose transport.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIID domain, with its homologous EIIC domain, forms
    the PTS system translocation channel and contains part of its
    specific substrate-binding site.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIID domain.
