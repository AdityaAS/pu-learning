-!- FUNCTION: Functions as a calcium permeable cation channel. PKD1
    and PKD2 may function through a common signaling pathway that is
    necessary for normal tubulogenesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PKD1. PKD1 requires the presence of PKD2
    for stable expression. Interacts with CD2AP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Strongly expressed in ovary, fetal and adult
    kidney, testis, and small intestine. Not detected in peripheral
    leukocytes.
-!- DOMAIN: The C-terminal is implicated in the interaction with PKD1.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PKD2 are the cause of autosomal dominant
    polycystic kidney disease type II (ADPKD-2) [MIM:173900]. ADPKD-2
    represents approximately 15% of the cases of ADPKD, a common
    autosomal dominant genetic disease affecting about 1:400 to 1:1000
    individuals. ADPKD is characterized by progressive formation and
    enlargement of cysts in both kidneys, typically leading to end-
    stage renal disease in adult life. Cysts also occurs in the liver
    and other organs. Most mutations, scattered between exons 1 and
    11, result in a truncated PKD2 that lacks both the calcium-binding
    EF-hand domain and the two cytoplasmic domains required for the
    interaction of PKD2 with PKD1 and with itself. ADPKD-2 is
    clinically milder than ADPKD-1, but it has a deleterious impact on
    overall life expectancy.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the polycystin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 EF-hand domain.
