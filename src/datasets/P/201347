-!- FUNCTION: Catalytic subunit of the peripheral V1 complex of
    vacuolar ATPase. V-ATPase (vacuolar ATPase) is responsible for
    acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic
    cells. It is an electrogenic proton pump that generates a proton
    motive force of 180 mV, inside positive and acidic, in the
    vacuolar membrane vesicles. It may participate in maintenance of
    cytoplasmic Ca(2+) homeostasis. This is a catalytic subunit.
-!- FUNCTION: PI-SceI is an endonuclease that can cleave at a site
    present in a VMA1 allele that lacks the derived endonuclease
    segment of the open reading frame; cleavage at this site only
    occurs during meiosis and initiates "homing", a genetic event that
    converts a VMA1 allele lacking VDE into one that contains it.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (components A to H) attached to an
    integral membrane V0 proton pore complex (components: a, c, c',
    c'', d and e). Interacts with RAV1 and RAV2 components of the RAVE
    complex, which are essential for the stability and assembly of V-
    ATPase.

-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Intracytoplasmic membrane. Note=Membranes of
    various intracellular acidic compartments.
-!- PTM: This protein undergoes a protein self splicing that involves
    a post-translational excision of the VDE intervening region
    (intein) followed by peptide ligation.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 199895 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DOD-type homing endonuclease domain.
