Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase iron-sulfur subunit (EC 1.10.2.2)
(Rieske iron-sulfur protein) (RISP).
"The genes of the Paracoccus denitrificans bc1 complex. Nucleotide
sequence and homologies between bacterial and mitochondrial
subunits.";
"Immunoelectron microscopy and epitope mapping with monoclonal
antibodies suggest the existence of an additional N-terminal
transmembrane helix in the cytochrome b subunit of bacterial
ubiquinol:cytochrome-c oxidoreductases.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase
    complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), which is a
    respiratory chain that generates an electrochemical potential
    coupled to ATP synthesis.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: QH(2) + 2 ferricytochrome c = Q + 2
    ferrocytochrome c.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The main subunits of complex b-c1 are: cytochrome b,
    cytochrome c1 and the Rieske protein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The Rieske protein is a high potential 2Fe-2S
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Rieske domain.
