-!- FUNCTION: This colicin is a channel-forming colicin. This class of
    transmembrane toxins depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane, leading
    to dissipation of cellular energy.
-!- FUNCTION: Colicins are polypeptide toxins produced by and active
    against, Escherichia coli and closely related bacteria.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the channel forming colicin family.
