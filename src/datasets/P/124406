AC   P14283;
Pertactin precursor (P.93) [Contains: Outer membrane protein P.69].
"Molecular cloning and characterization of protective outer membrane
protein P.69 from Bordetella pertussis.";
"Cloning, nucleotide sequence and heterologous expression of the
protective outer-membrane protein P.68 pertactin from Bordetella
bronchiseptica.";
"Comparative analysis of the genome sequences of Bordetella pertussis,
Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica.";
"Structure of Bordetella pertussis virulence factor P.69 pertactin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Agglutinogen that binds to eukaryotic cells; a process
    mediated by the R-G-D sequence. Pertactin may have a role in
    bacterial adhesion, and thus play a role in virulence. May
    contribute to the disease state of whooping cough.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Synthesized only in the presence of low Mg(2+)
    concentration.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 autotransporter (TC 1.B.12) domain.
