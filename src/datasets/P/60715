Glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase subunit gamma (EC 4.1.1.70) (Biotin
carrier).
"The sodium ion translocating glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase from
Acidaminococcus fermentans: cloning and function of the genes forming
a second operon.";
-!- FUNCTION: Biotin carrier subunit of the primary sodium pump
    glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (GCD).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4-carboxybut-2-enoyl-CoA = but-2-enoyl-CoA +
    CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Biotin.
-!- PATHWAY: Anaerobic glutamate metabolism; fifth step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooctamer consisting of two alpha, two beta, two
    gamma and two delta subunits.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 biotinyl-binding domain.
