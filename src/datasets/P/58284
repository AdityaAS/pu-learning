AC   Q61835;
FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 3 precursor (Chloride
conductance inducer protein Mat-8) (Mammary tumor 8 kDa protein)
(Phospholemman-like).
"neu and ras initiate murine mammary tumors that share genetic markers
generally absent in c-myc and int-2-initiated tumors.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Mat-8, a novel phospholemman-like protein expressed in human breast
tumors, induces a chloride conductance in Xenopus oocytes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Induces a hyperpolarization-activated chloride current
    when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. May be a modulator capable of
    activating endogenous oocyte channels.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in a subset of murine breast tumors.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Marker of a cell type preferentially transformed by
    neu or ras oncoprotein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FXYD family.
