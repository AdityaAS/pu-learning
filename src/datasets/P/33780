-!- FUNCTION: Peptide utilization during carbon starvation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By carbon starvation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cstA family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 543.
