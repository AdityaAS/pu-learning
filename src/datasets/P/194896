-!- FUNCTION: Thyroid hormone-binding protein. Probably transports
    thyroxine from the bloodstream to the brain.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Most abundant in the choroid plexus. Also
    present in the liver.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein binds retinol-binding protein at
    levels similar to, and the thyroid hormones at levels much higher
    than, the human protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transthyretin family.
