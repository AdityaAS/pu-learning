-!- FUNCTION: May supply copper to copper-requiring proteins within
    the secretory pathway, when localized in the trans-Golgi network.
    Under conditions of elevated extracellular copper, it relocalized
    to the plasma membrane where it functions in the efflux of copper
    from cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Cu(2+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    Cu(2+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network; trans-
    Golgi network membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Cell
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Isoform 3: Cytoplasm;
    cytosol (Probable). Isoform 5: Endoplasmic reticulum. Note=Cycles
    constitutively between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the
    plasma membrane. Predominantly found in the TGN and relocalized to
    the plasma membrane in response to elevated copper levels.

      Note=Lacks all transmembrane regions and 5
      heavy-metal-associated (HMA) domains, but has a putative nuclear
      localization signal attached at the N-terminus;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found in most tissues except liver. Isoform 3
    is widely expressed including in liver cell lines. Isoform 1 is
    expressed in fibroblasts, choriocarcinoma, colon carcinoma and
    neuroblastoma cell lines. Isoform 2 is expressed in fibroblasts,
    colon carcinoma and neuroblastoma cell lines.
-!- DOMAIN: The C-terminal di-leucine, 1487-Leu-Leu-1488, is an
    endocytic targeting signal which functions in retrieving recycling
    from the plasma membrane to the TGN. Mutation of the di-leucine
    signal results in the accumulation of the protein in the plasma
    membrane.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in ATP7A are the cause of Menkes syndrome (MD)
    [MIM:309400]; also known as kinky hair disease. MD is an X-linked
    recessive disease characterized by progressive neurodegeneration
    and connective-tissue disturbances: focal cerebral and cerebellar
    degeneration, early retardation in growth, peculiar hair,
    hypopigmentation, cutis laxa, vascular complications and death in
    early childhood. It is due to a defect in absorption and transport
    of copper.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in ATP7A are the cause of occipital horn syndrome
    (OHS) [MIM:304150]; also known as X-linked cutis laxa. Common
    features are unusual facial appearance, skeletal abnormalities,
    chronic diarrhea and genitourinary defects. The skeletal
    abnormalities included occipital horns, short, broad clavicles,
    deformed radii, ulnae and humeri, narrowing of the rib cage,
    undercalcified long bones with thin cortical walls and coxa valga.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 HMA domains.
