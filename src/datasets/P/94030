"The gene yghK linked to the glc operon of Escherichia coli encodes a
permease for glycolate that is structurally and functionally similar
to L-lactate permease.";

proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transports L-lactate across the membrane. Can also
    transport D-lactate and glycolate. Seems to be driven by a proton
    motive force.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-
    chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By L-lactate; aerobically.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lactate permease family.
