AC   P31801;
Calcium/proton antiporter.
"Cloning and characterization of a putative Ca2+/H+ antiporter gene
from Escherichia coli upon functional complementation of Na+/H+
antiporter-deficient strains by the overexpressed gene.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";

proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: According to Ref.1 the natural activity of this protein
    is as a calcium/proton antiporter, but it can act as a weak
    sodium/proton antiporter. The presence of a preferred substrate
    and normal pH cytoplasmic values might prevent significant
    sodium/proton antiporter activity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Pronounced pH dependence. Inhibition by magnesium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger
    family.
