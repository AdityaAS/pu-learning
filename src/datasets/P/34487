-!- FUNCTION: Part of a cation efflux system that mediates resistance
    to copper and silver.
-!- SUBUNIT: The cus efflux system is composed of cusA, cusB, cusC and
    cusF.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P46850:rtcB; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1118842, EBI-1115171;
-!- INDUCTION: Transcriptionally regulated by cusR in response to
    copper and silver ions.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The cus system plays an important role in copper
    tolerance under anaerobic growth and, under extreme copper stress,
    in aerobic growth.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the membrane fusion protein (MFP)
    (TC 8.A.1) family.
