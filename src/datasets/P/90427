AC   P80666;
Lantibiotic mutacin B-Ny266.
"Purification and structure of mutacin B-Ny266: a new lantibiotic
produced by Streptococcus mutans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic)
    active on Gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal activity of
    lantibiotics is based on depolarization of energized bacterial
    cytoplasmic membranes, initiated by the formation of aqueous
    transmembrane pores.
-!- PTM: Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of
    Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether
    bonds with cysteine. The C-terminal lanthionine undergoes
    decarboxylation. This is followed by membrane translocation and
    cleavage of the modified precursor.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2270.29; MW_ERR=0.21; METHOD=Electrospray;
    RANGE=1-22; NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type A lantibiotic family.
