AC   P22037;
Protein mgtC.
"The mgtB Mg2+ transport locus of Salmonella typhimurium encodes a P-
type ATPase.";
"The SPI-3 pathogenicity island of salmonella enterica.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"The Salmonella selC locus contains a pathogenicity island mediating
intramacrophage survival.";
"Magnesium and the role of MgtC in growth of Salmonella typhimurium.";
"The MgtC virulence factor of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
activates Na(+),K(+)-ATPase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Virulence factor required for growth in low Mg(2+)
    medium and for intramacrophage survival. May be involved in
    regulating membrane potential by activating Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Transcriptionally regulated by extracellular magnesium
    via the two-component regulatory system phoQ/phoP.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mgtC/sapB family.
