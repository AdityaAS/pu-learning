AC   P16465;
Hemolysin activator protein precursor.
"Nucleotide sequencing of the Proteus mirabilis calcium-independent
hemolysin genes (hpmA and hpmB) reveals sequence similarity with the
Serratia marcescens hemolysin genes (shlA and shlB).";
-!- FUNCTION: Interacts with the cell-bound hemolysin. Necessary for
    the extracellular secretion and activation of the hemolysin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M19 family.
