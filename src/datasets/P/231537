Zinc transporter zitB.
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"ZitB (YbgR), a member of the cation diffusion facilitator family, is
an additional zinc transporter in Escherichia coli.";
"Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in zinc efflux across the cytoplasmic membrane,
    thus reducing zinc accumulation in the cytoplasm and rendering
    bacteria more resistant to zinc. It may contribute to zinc
    homeostasis at low concentrations of zinc, whereas zntA is
    required for growth at more toxic concentrations.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By zinc.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Appears to be selective for zinc, not conferring
    resistance to cobalt nor cadmium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)
    transporter (TC 2.A.4) family. SLC30A subfamily.
