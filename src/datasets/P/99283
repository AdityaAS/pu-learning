-!- FUNCTION: Part of a multidrug resistance efflux system that
    confers resistance to compounds such as rhodamine 6G,
    erythromycin, doxorubicin, ethidium bromide, TPP, SDS,
    deoxycholate, crystal violet and benzalkonium.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer. Part of a tripartite efflux system composed
    of mdtE, mdtF and tolC.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by evgA, probably via ydeO.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acrB/acrD/acrF (TC 2.A.6) family.
