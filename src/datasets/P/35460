-!- FUNCTION: Heme-containing component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c
    reductase complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), which
    is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that generates an
    electrochemical potential coupled to ATP synthesis. The complex
    couples electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c.
-!- SUBUNIT: Fungi cytochrome b-c1 complex contains 10 subunits; 3
    respiratory subunits, 2 core proteins and 5 low-molecular weight
    proteins. Cytochrome b-c1 complex is a homodimer.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P10592:SSA2; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-5357, EBI-8603;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    single-pass membrane protein; intermembrane side.
-!- PTM: Binds 1 heme group per subunit.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 39900 molecules/cell.
