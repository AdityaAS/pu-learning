AC   Q08857;
Platelet glycoprotein 4 (Platelet glycoprotein IV) (GPIV) (GPIIIB)
(CD36 antigen) (PAS IV) (PAS-4 protein).
"CD36 is a receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to have numerous potential physiological
    functions. Binds to collagen, thrombospondin, anionic
    phospholipids and oxidized LDL. May function as a cell adhesion
    molecule. Directly mediates cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum
    parasitized erythrocytes. Binds long chain fatty acids and may
    function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty acid
    transport.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CD36 family.
