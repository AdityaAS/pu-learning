Quinol oxidase subunit 1 (EC 1.10.3.-) (Quinol oxidase polypeptide I)
(Cytochrome aa3 subunit 1) (Oxidase aa(3) subunit 1).
"An archaebacterial terminal oxidase combines core structures of two
mitochondrial respiratory complexes.";
"The genome of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, a model organism of the
Crenarchaeota.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water.
-!- FUNCTION: Subunits I, II and III form the functional core of the
    enzyme complex. Electrons originating in caldariella quinol are
    transferred to the binuclear center formed by heme A3 and Cu(B).
-!- FUNCTION: Subunit I binds heme a and the bimetallic center.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Ubiquinol-8 + O(2) = Ubiquinone-8 + H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Ethanol oxidation; terminal oxidase.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the heme-copper respiratory oxidase family.
