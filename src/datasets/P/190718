-!- FUNCTION: PTX oligomer B binds to receptors on the eukaryotic cell
    surface and facilitates the translocation of the toxic subunit
    across the cell membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Pertussis toxin contains five different chains, S1-S5.
    They are organized into 2 functional subunits: A, composed of S1
    (which is toxic) and B, containing S2, S3, S5, and two copies of
    S4 (B binds to the membrane receptors). Dimers of S2-S4 and S3-S4
    are held together by S5.
