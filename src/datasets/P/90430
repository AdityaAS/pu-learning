sequence.";

and functional analysis of PepP and PepC. Evidence for a role of PepC
in thioether formation.";

of a prepeptide containing dehydroamino acids.";
-!- FUNCTION: Lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic)
    active on Gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal activity of
    lantibiotics is based on depolarization of energized bacterial
    cytoplasmic membranes, initiated by the formation of aqueous
    transmembrane pores.
-!- PTM: Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of
    Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether
    bonds with cysteine. This is followed by membrane translocation
    and cleavage of the modified precursor.
-!- PTM: After proteolysis of the propeptide, the N-terminal 2,3-
    didehydrobutyrine hydrolyzes to 2-oxobutanoic acid, possibly
    spontaneously.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type A lantibiotic family.
