-!- FUNCTION: Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton
    gradient across the membrane. The catalytic sites are hosted
    primarily by the beta subunits.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a(1), b(2) and c(9-12). The alpha and
    beta chains form an alternating ring which encloses part of the
    gamma chain. CF(1) is attached to CF(0) by a central stalk formed
    by the gamma and epsilon chains, while a peripheral stalk is
    formed by the delta and b chains.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0ABB0:atpA; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-368783, EBI-368707;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
