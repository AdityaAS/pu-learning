-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export. Interacts with the secY/secE
    subunits. SecA has a central role in coupling the hydrolysis of
    ATP to the transfer of pre-secretory periplasmic and outer
    membrane proteins across the membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus
    which comprise secA, secB, secD, secE, secF, secG and secY.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0AGA2:secY; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-543213, EBI-761422;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein;
    cytoplasmic side.
-!- INDUCTION: Repressed under conditions of excess protein secretion
    capacity and derepressed when protein secretion become limiting.
    This is regulated by secM.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secA family.
