Tonoplast dicarboxylate transporter (AttDT) (Vacuolar malate
transporter) (Sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter-like) (AtSDAT).
"The plant homolog to the human sodium/dicarboxylic cotransporter is
the vacuolar malate carrier.";
"Sodium sulfate or dicarboxylate transporter form Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Structural analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 5. XI.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
"Full-length cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana.";
"Impaired pH homeostasis in Arabidopsis lacking the vacuolar
dicarboxylate transporter and analysis of carboxylic acid transport
across the tonoplast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Putative carrier protein indirectly involved in the
    uptake of malate and fumarate to the vacuole, probably by
    regulating the energization across the tonoplast. Uptake of malate
    to vacuoles is inhibited by citrate and by the uncoupler carbonyl-
    cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, but seems to be not affected by
    sodium. Critical for pH homeostasis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein. Note=Tonoplast.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in leaves, stems and flowers.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by malate and by acidification of the
    cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC13A transporter (TC 2.A.47) family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to frameshifts
    in positions 475 and 479.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
