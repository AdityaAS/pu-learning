-!- SUBUNIT: The pili are polar flexible filaments of about 5.4
    nanometers diameter and 2.5 micrometers average length; they
    consist of only a single polypeptide chain arranged in a helical
    configuration of five subunits per turn in the assembled pilus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the N-Me-Phe pili family.
