AC   P29924;
NADH-quinone oxidoreductase chain 12 (EC 1.6.99.5) (NADH dehydrogenase
I, chain 12) (NDH-1, chain 12).
"DNA sequencing of the seven remaining structural genes of the gene
cluster encoding the energy-transducing NADH-quinone oxidoreductase of
Paracoccus denitrificans.";
-!- FUNCTION: NDH-1 shuttles electrons from NADH, via FMN and iron-
    sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the respiratory chain. The
    immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is
    believed to be ubiquinone. Couples the redox reaction to proton
    translocation (for every two electrons transferred, four hydrogen
    ions are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus
    conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + quinone = NAD(+) + quinol.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of 14 different subunits. Subunits NQO7-14
    constitute the membrane sector of the complex.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I subunit 5 family.
