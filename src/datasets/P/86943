AC   P97414; O88702; Q7TNZ1; Q7TPL7; Q80VR7;
Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily KQT member 1 (Voltage-gated
potassium channel subunit Kv7.1) (IKs producing slow voltage-gated
potassium channel subunit alpha KvLQT1) (KQT-like 1).
"Isoproterenol exacerbates a long QT phenotype in Kcnq1-deficient
neonatal mice: possible roles for human-like Kcnq1 isoform 1 and slow
delayed rectifier K+ current.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"K(V)LQT1 and IsK (minK) proteins associate to form the I(Ks) cardiac
potassium current.";
"Syntenic organization of the mouse distal chromosome 7 imprinting
cluster and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome region in chromosome
11p15.5.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably important in cardiac repolarization. Associates
    with KCNE1 (MinK) to form the I(Ks) cardiac potassium current.
    Elicits a rapidly activating, potassium-selective outward current.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heteromultimer with KCNE1 (MinK).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=I;
      IsoId=P97414-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=II;
      IsoId=P97414-2; Sequence=VSP_011748, VSP_000983;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in heart, kidney and salivary
    glands. Detected in the cochlea. Almost undetectable in brain,
    skeletal muscle and liver. Widely expressed in embryonic and
    neonatal tissues.
-!- DOMAIN: The segment S4 is probably the voltage-sensor and is
    characterized by a series of positively charged amino acids at
    every third position.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family. KQT
    subfamily.
