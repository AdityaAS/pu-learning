AC   P32026;
Flower-specific gamma-thionin precursor.
"A flower-specific cDNA encoding a novel thionin in tobacco.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in floral organogenesis. May play a protective
    role in flowers by protecting the reproductive organs from
    potential pathogen attack.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell wall (Potential). Vacuole (Potential).
    Note=Possibly the cell wall or vacuole.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Flower. Found in petals, stamen and pistils,
    but not in sepals. In particular, accumulation in a configuration
    surrounding the inner reproductive whorls.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Accumulates in developing flowers and its
    level drops as flowers mature.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the plant defensin family.
