AC   P0C0L8; P30848;
Proline/betaine transporter (Proline porter II) (PPII).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Proton symporter that senses osmotic shifts and responds
    by importing osmolytes such as proline, glycine betaine,
    stachydrine, pipecolic acid, ectoine and taurine. It is both an
    osmosensor and an osmoregulator which is available to participate
    early in the bacterial osmoregulatory response (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
