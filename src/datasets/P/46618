AC   P54281;
Epithelial chloride channel protein (Calcium-activated chloride
channel).
"Cloning of an epithelial chloride channel from bovine trachea.";
-!- FUNCTION: Voltage-gated chloride channel. Chloride channels have
    several functions including the regulation of cell volume;
    membrane potential stabilization, signal transduction and
    transepithelial transport.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Trachea.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by CaM-kinase II.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 VWFA domain.
