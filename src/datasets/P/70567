Hyaluronan synthase (EC 2.4.1.212) (Hyaluronate synthase) (Hyaluronic
acid synthase) (HA synthase).
"Molecular cloning, identification, and sequence of the hyaluronan
synthase gene from group A Streptococcus pyogenes.";
"Progress toward characterization of the group A Streptococcus
metagenome: complete genome sequence of a macrolide-resistant serotype
M6 strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Glycosaminoglycan synthesis. The hyaluronic acid capsule
    is involved in the pathogenicity of group A Streptococci; it may
    be the major virulence determinant.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: n UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + n UDP-D-
    glucuronate = (beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl(1->4)-beta-D-
    glucuronosyl(1->3))(n) + 2n UDP.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycan biosynthesis; hyaluronan biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nodC/HAS family.
-!- CAUTION: It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-25 is the initiator.
