Cytochrome c oxidase polypeptide 1 (EC 1.9.3.1) (Cytochrome c oxidase
polypeptide I) (Cytochrome aa3 subunit 1).
"Molecular cloning of the cytochrome aa3 gene from the archaeon
(Archaebacterium) Halobacterium halobium.";
"Genome sequence of Halobacterium species NRC-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory
    chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Subunits 1-
    3 form the functional core of the enzyme complex. CO I is the
    catalytic subunit of the enzyme. Electrons originating in
    cytochrome c are transferred via the copper A center of subunit 2
    and heme A of subunit 1 to the bimetallic center formed by heme A3
    and copper B.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Respiratory chain; terminal step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the heme-copper respiratory oxidase family.
