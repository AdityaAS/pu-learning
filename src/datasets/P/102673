Chemotaxis protein motB (Motility protein B).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the rotation of the flagellar motor. Might
    be a linker that fastens the torque-generating machinery to the
    cell wall (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass type II
    membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the motB family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 OmpA-like domain.
