-!- FUNCTION: Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the
    entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved
    in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle
    contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression,
    cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1D
    gives rise to L-type calcium currents. Long-lasting (L-type)
    calcium channels belong to the "high-voltage activated" (HVA)
    group. They are blocked by dihydropyridines (DHP),
    phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines, and by omega-agatoxin-IIIA
    (omega-Aga-IIIA). They are however insensitive to omega-conotoxin-
    GVIA (omega-CTx-GVIA) and omega-agatoxin-IVA (omega-Aga-IVA).
-!- SUBUNIT: Voltage-dependent calcium channels are multisubunit
    complexes, consisting of alpha-1, alpha-2, beta and delta subunits
    in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The channel activity is directed by the pore-
    forming and voltage-sensitive alpha-1 subunit. In many cases, this
    subunit is sufficient to generate voltage-sensitive calcium
    channel activity. The auxiliary subunits beta and alpha-2/delta
    linked by a disulfide bridge regulate the channel activity.
    Interacts with RIMBP2 (By similarity).

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in brain, pancreatic islets and B-
    lymphocytes.
-!- DOMAIN: Each of the four internal repeats contains five
    hydrophobic transmembrane segments (S1, S2, S3, S5, S6) and one
    positively charged transmembrane segment (S4). S4 segments
    probably represent the voltage-sensor and are characterized by a
    series of positively charged amino acids at every third position.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the calcium channel alpha-1 subunit family.
