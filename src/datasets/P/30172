AC   P32113; Q47841;
Probable copper-importing ATPase A (EC 3.6.3.4).
"Primary structure of two P-type ATPases involved in copper
homeostasis in Enterococcus hirae.";
"Two trans-acting metalloregulatory proteins controlling expression of
the copper-ATPases of Enterococcus hirae.";
-!- FUNCTION: The copper-transporting proteins, CopA and CopB, are
    implicated in the regulation of cytoplasmic copper, copA being the
    importer and copB the exporter of the metal. They may probably
    serve as well for the import of other metals.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Cu(2+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    Cu(2+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By copper.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HMA domain.
