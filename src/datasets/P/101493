AC   P54571;
Malate-2H(+)/Na(+)-lactate antiporter.
"Systematic sequencing of the 283 kb 210 degrees-232 degrees region of
the Bacillus subtilis genome containing the skin element and many
sporulation genes.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Bacillus subtilis YqkI is a novel malic/Na+-lactate antiporter that
enhances growth on malate at low protonmotive force.";
-!- FUNCTION: Couples proton uptake and Na(+) efflux to the substrate-
    product malate/lactate antiport, in an electroneutral malate-
    2H(+)/Na(+)-lactate exchange. Plays a role in supporting growth to
    high density on malate at reduced protonmotive force.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nhaC Na(+)/H(+) antiporter family.
