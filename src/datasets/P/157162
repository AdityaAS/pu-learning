flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the proteins responsible for the rod
    shape of E.coli. Is required for the expression of the enzymatic
    activity of PBP2, which is thought to synthesize peptidoglycan in
    the step of initiation of cell elongation (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ftsW/rodA/spoVE family.
