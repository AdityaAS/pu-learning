AC   P0AEP2; P37021;
Galactose-proton symporter (Galactose transporter).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Uptake of galactose across the boundary membrane with
    the concomitant transport of protons into the cell (symport
    system) (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
