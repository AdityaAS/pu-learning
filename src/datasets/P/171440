AC   Q9S1H0;
Selenate reductase subunit alpha precursor (EC 1.97.1.9) (Selenate
reductase molybdenum subunit).
"Cloning and sequencing of the genes encoding the periplasmic-
cytochrome B-containing selenate reductase of Thauera selenatis.";

reductase from Thauera selenatis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Terminal reductase that allows anaerobic growth on
    selenate as the sole respiratory oxidant.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Selenite + H(2)O + acceptor = selenate +
    reduced acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster (Potential).
-!- COFACTOR: Molybdenum (molybdopterin).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by O(2).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimer of alpha, beta and gamma subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- PTM: Predicted to be exported by the Tat system. The position of
    the signal peptide cleavage has been experimentally proven.
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Has potential use in bioremediation of waste sites
    contaminated with selenate, such as agricultural drainage waters.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family.
