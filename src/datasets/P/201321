AC   Q60186;
V-type ATP synthase alpha chain (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-type ATPase subunit
A).
"Subunit structure and organization of the genes of the A1A0 ATPase
from the Archaeon Methanosarcina mazei Go1.";
"The genome of Methanosarcina mazei: evidence for lateral gene
transfer between Bacteria and Archaea.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton
    gradient across the membrane. The archaeal alpha chain is a
    catalytic subunit.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Stimulated by sulfite, ethanol, glycerol,
    magnesium and zinc ions.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 5.2;
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of seven subunits; A, B, C, D, E, F and G.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
