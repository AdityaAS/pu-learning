AC   P69796; P17409;
N,N'-diacetylchitobiose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIB
component (EC 2.7.1.69) (PTS system N,N'-diacetylchitobiose-specific
EIIB component).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in N,N'-diacetylchitobiose
    transport (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine + sugar = protein EIIB + sugar phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: N,N'-diacetylchitobiose utilization.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer; in both its unphosphorylated and phosphorylated
    forms (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By N,N'-diacetylchitobiose (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIB domain is phosphorylated by phospho-EIIA on a
    cysteinyl or histidyl residue, depending on the transported sugar.
    Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the sugar substrate
    concomitantly with the sugar uptake processed by the EIIC domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIB type-3 domain.
