-!- FUNCTION: May participate directly in the active transport of
    drugs into subcellular organelles or influence drug distribution
    indirectly. Transports glutathione conjugates as Leukotriene-c4
    (LTC4) and N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione (NEM-GS).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By
    similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in kidney and liver. Very low
    expression in other tissues.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in ABCC6 are a cause of autosomal dominant
    pseudoxanthoma elasticum (AD-PXE) [MIM:177850]. PXE is a disorder
    characterized by calcification of elastic fibers in skin, arteries
    and retina that results in dermal lesions with associated laxity
    and loss of elasticity, arterial insufficiency and retinal
    hemorrhages leading to macular degeneration.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in ABCC6 are a cause of autosomal recessive
    pseudoxanthoma elasticum (AR-PXE) [MIM:264800].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Conjugate
    transporter (TC 3.A.1.208) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transmembrane type-1 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
