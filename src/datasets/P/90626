-!- FUNCTION: Binds to the lipid A moiety of bacterial
    lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a glycolipid present in the outer
    membrane of all Gram-negative bacteria. The LBP/LPS complex seems
    to interact with the CD14 receptor.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the BPI/LBP/Plunc superfamily. BPI/LBP
    family.
