-!- FUNCTION: Binds ferrienterobactin; part of the binding-protein-
    dependent transport system for uptake of ferrienterobactin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- INDUCTION: Controlled in part by the amount of available iron.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 8
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Fe/B12 periplasmic-binding domain.
