-!- FUNCTION: Main toxin of bee venom with strong hemolytic activity.
    Integrates into cell membranes and has multiple effects, probably,
    as a result of its interaction with negatively charged
    phospholipids. It inhibits well known transport pumps such as the
    Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase. Increases the
    permeability of cell membranes to ions, particularly Na+ and
    indirectly Ca(2+), because of the Na(+)-Ca(2+)-exchange.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer and homotetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- ALLERGEN: Causes an allergic reaction in human.
-!- TOXIC DOSE: LC(50) is 2.7 ug/ml against killifish.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: N-formyl-melittin major has 80% of the activity of
    melittin.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the melittin family.
