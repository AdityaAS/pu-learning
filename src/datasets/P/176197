Probable chromate transport protein.
"Genes encoded on a cyanobacterial plasmid are transcriptionally
regulated by sulfur availability and CysR.";
"pANL, the large plasmid of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942.";
"Complete sequence of plasmid 1 of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942.";
-!- FUNCTION: May function in the active transport of chromate into
    the cell under sulfur-deficient conditions.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: By sulfur deprivation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chromate ion transporter (CHR)
    (TC 2.A.51) family.
