AC   P68580; O30671; O31988; O64034;
Sublancin 168-processing and transport ATP-binding protein sunT
(EC 3.4.22.-).
"Nucleotide sequence of the Bacillus subtilis temperate bacteriophage
SPbetac2.";
-!- FUNCTION: SunT (TC 3.A.1.112.4) is required for production of the
    lantibiotic sublancin 168, probably by both processing the signal
    peptide and exporting the resulting mature lantibiotic (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. SunT subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase C39 domain.
