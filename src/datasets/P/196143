-!- FUNCTION: Uric acid-xanthine transporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Not detected in resting conidiospores.
    Transcription is activated during the isotropic growth phase of
    conidiospores.
-!- INDUCTION: Inducible by 2-thiouric acid, and highly repressible by
    ammonium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the xanthine/uracil permease family.
