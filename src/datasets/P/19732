AC   P25230;
Antimicrobial protein CAP18 precursor (18 kDa lipopolysaccharide-
binding protein) (18 kDa cationic protein) (CAP18-A) [Contains:
Antimicrobial protein CAP7].
"Complementary DNA sequence of rabbit CAP18 -- a unique
lipopolysaccharide binding protein.";
"Characterization of a rabbit cationic protein (CAP18) with
lipopolysaccharide-inhibitory activity.";
"A novel granulocyte-derived peptide with lipopolysaccharide-
neutralizing activity.";
"Identification and characterization of a primary antibacterial domain
in CAP18, a lipopolysaccharide binding protein from rabbit
leukocytes.";
"The solution structure of the active domain of CAP18 -- a
lipopolysaccharide binding protein from rabbit leukocytes.";
-!- FUNCTION: CAP18 binds to the lipid A moiety of bacterial
    lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a glycolipid present in the outer
    membrane of all Gram-negative bacteria. Has antibiotic activity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Neutrophils.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cathelicidin family.
