AC   P32977;
Porin O precursor.
"Polyphosphate-selective porin OprO of Pseudomonas aeruginosa:
expression, purification and sequence.";
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
-!- FUNCTION: Anion specific, the binding site has higher affinity for
    phosphate than chloride ions. Porin O has a higher affinity for
    polyphosphates (tripolyphosphate and pyrophosphate) while porin P
    has a higher affinity for orthophosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed only during the stationary growth
    phase.
-!- INDUCTION: By phosphate starvation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the oprO/oprP family.
