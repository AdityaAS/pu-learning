Iron(III) dicitrate transport ATP-binding protein fecE.
"Nucleotide sequences of the fecBCDE genes and locations of the
proteins suggest a periplasmic-binding-protein-dependent transport
mechanism for iron(III) dicitrate in Escherichia coli.";

-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for citrate-dependent Fe(3+). Probably responsible for energy
    coupling to the transport system.
