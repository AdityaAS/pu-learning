AC   P54104;
Branched-chain amino acid transport system carrier protein (Branched-
chain amino acid uptake carrier).
"Cloning and characterization of brnQ, a gene encoding a low-affinity,
branched-chain amino acid carrier in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp.
lactis DSM7290.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the transport system for branched-chain
    amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) Which is coupled to a
    proton motive force.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the braC/braZ/brnQ transporter family.
