AC   P58300;
Maltotriose-binding protein precursor (Maltodextrin-binding protein)
(MMBP).
"The complete sequence of the Pyrococcus furiosus genome.";
"Structural basis for oligosaccharide recognition by Pyrococcus
furiosus maltodextrin-binding protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in an abc transport system for maltotriose.
    Binds maltotriose much more tightly than maltose.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 1
    family.
