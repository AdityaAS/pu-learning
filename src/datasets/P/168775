Sodium/nucleoside cotransporter 2 (Na(+)/nucleoside cotransporter 2)
(Sodium-coupled nucleoside transporter 2) (Concentrative nucleoside
transporter 2) (CNT 2) (Sodium/purine nucleoside cotransporter) (SPNT)
(RCNT2).
"Primary structure and functional expression of a cDNA encoding the
bile canalicular, purine-specific Na(+)-nucleoside cotransporter.";
"Transport of adenosine by recombinant purine- and pyrimidine-
selective sodium/nucleoside cotransporters from rat jejunum expressed
in Xenopus laevis oocytes.";
"A nucleoside transporter is functionally linked to ectonucleotidases
in rat liver canalicular membrane.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium-dependent and purine-selective. Exhibits the
    transport characteristics of the nucleoside transport system cif
    or N1 subtype (N1/cif) (selective for purine nucleosides and
    uridine). Accepts purine, analogs of purine nucleosides and
    uridine, and exhibits high affinity for adenosine.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by formycin B, partially inhibited by
    purine analog ara-A.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in liver (in bile canalicular
    membrane vesicles (CMV) but not in sinusoidal vesicles), jejunum,
    spleen and heart. Also expressed in brain and skeletal muscle. Not
    expressed in kidney, muscle and lung.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC28A transporter family.
