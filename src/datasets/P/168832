expressed differentially in liver.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium-dependent amino acid/proton antiporter. Mediates
    electrogenic cotransport of glutamine and sodium ions in exchange
    for protons. Also recognizes histidine, asparagine and alanine.
    May mediate amino acid transport in either direction under
    physiological conditions. May play a role in nitrogen metabolism
    and synaptic transmission.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed predominantly in liver, moderately
    expressed in kidney and brain, and barely detectable in heart and
    muscle. Within liver, expressed in hepatocytes. Not detected in
    testis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid/polyamine transporter 2
    family.
