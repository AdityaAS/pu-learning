-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for branched-chain amino acids. Probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrates across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. LivHM subfamily.
