AC   Q9ZHC7;
Putative cation-transporting P-type ATPase (EC 3.6.3.-).
"Molecular basis for resistance to silver cations in Salmonella.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the sil cation-efflux system that confers
    resistance to silver.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O = ADP + phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IB subfamily.
