-!- FUNCTION: Part of the anaerobic respiratory chain of
    trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase torA. Acts by transferring
    electrons from the membranous menaquinones to torA. This transfer
    probably involves an electron transfer pathway from menaquinones
    to the N-terminal domain of torC, then from the N-terminus to the
    C-terminus, and finally to torA. TorC apocytochrome negatively
    autoregulates the torCAD operon probably by inhibiting the torS
    kinase activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: The N-terminal domain interacts with torA. The immature
    C-terminal domain can bind to the N-terminal detector region of
    torS.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass type II
    membrane protein.
-!- PTM: Binds 5 heme groups per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the torC/torY family.
