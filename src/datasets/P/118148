-!- FUNCTION: Required for the action of colicins K and L and for the
    stabilization of mating aggregates in conjugation. Serves as a
    receptor for a number of T-even like phages. Also acts as a porin
    with low permeability that allows slow penetration of small
    solutes.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- INTERACTION:

    P78285:ybcS; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-371347, EBI-1118665;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=35177; METHOD=Electrospray; RANGE=22-346;
    NOTE=Ref.19.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ompA family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 OmpA-like domain.
