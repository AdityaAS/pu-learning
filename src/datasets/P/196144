AC   P48777;
Purine permease.
"Genetic and molecular characterization of a gene encoding a wide
specificity purine permease of Aspergillus nidulans reveals a novel
family of transporters conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Able to transport with low efficiency all natural
    purines as well as purine analogs.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Inducible by 2-thiouric acid, and highly repressible by
    ammonium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the xanthine/uracil permease family.
