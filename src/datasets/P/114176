Nitrate transport ATP-binding protein nrtD.
"Identification and characterization of a gene cluster involved in
nitrate transport in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC7942.";
"Complete sequence of chromosome 1 of Synechococcus elongatus PCC
7942.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably part of a high-affinity binding-protein-
    dependent transport system for nitrate. Probably responsible for
    energy coupling to the transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
