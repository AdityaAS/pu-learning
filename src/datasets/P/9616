-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the export of arginine. Important to control
    the intracellular level of arginine and the correct balance
    between arginine and lysine. May also be involved in the export of
    canavanine (a plant-derived antimetabolite).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Transcriptionally regulated by argP in response to the
    accumulation of intracellular arginine or canavanine. Lysine has a
    negative effect on the expression of argO.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lysE/argO transporter (TC 2.A.75)
    family.
