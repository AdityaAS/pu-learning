AC   Q47087;
Achromobactin transport ATP-binding protein cbrD.
"Differential expression of two siderophore-dependent iron-acquisition
pathways in Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937: characterization of a novel
ferrisiderophore permease of the ABC transporter family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    cbrABCD for uptake of the siderophore achromobactin. Probably
    responsible for energy coupling to the transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
