-!- FUNCTION: NDH-1 shuttles electrons from NADH, via FMN and iron-
    sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the respiratory chain. The
    immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is
    believed to be ubiquinone. Couples the redox reaction to proton
    translocation (for every two electrons transferred, four hydrogen
    ions are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus
    conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + quinone = NAD(+) + quinol.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster (Potential).
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of 13 different subunits (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I 20 kDa subunit family.
