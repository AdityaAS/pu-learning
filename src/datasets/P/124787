-!- FUNCTION: Component of the peroxisomal translocation machinery
    with PEX13 and PEX17. Interacts with both the PTS1 and PTS2
    receptors. Binds directly to PEX17.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PEX19.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P40855:PEX19; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-594898, EBI-594747;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Peroxisome; peroxisomal membrane; peripheral
    membrane protein; cytoplasmic side.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peroxin 14 family.
