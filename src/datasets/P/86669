-!- FUNCTION: Accessory potassium channel protein which modulates the
    activity of the pore-forming alpha subunit. All three isoforms
    alter the functional properties of Kv1.4 and Kv1.5. Isoform KvB1.2
    has no effect on Kv1.1, Kv1.2 or Kv2.1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms heteromultimeric complex with alpha subunits.
    Interacts with SQSTM1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
    Name=KvB1.3;
      IsoId=Q14722-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=KvB1.1;
      IsoId=Q14722-2; Sequence=VSP_001051;
    Name=KvB1.2;
      IsoId=Q14722-3; Sequence=VSP_001050;
      Note=Ref.6 (AAC50113) sequence is in conflict in position:
      16:L->S;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: In brain, expression is most prominent in
    caudate nucleus, hippocampus and thalamus. Significant expression
    also detected in amygdala and subthalamic nucleus. Also expressed
    in both healthy and cardiomyopathic heart. Up to four times more
    abundant in left ventricle than left atrium.
-!- DOMAIN: Alteration of functional properties of alpha subunit is
    mediated through N-terminal domain of beta subunit (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the shaker potassium channel beta subunit
    family.
