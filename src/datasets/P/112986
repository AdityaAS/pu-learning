AC   O82855;
Multidrug resistance protein norM (Na(+)/drug antiporter) (Multidrug-
efflux transporter).
"NorM, a putative multidrug efflux protein, of Vibrio parahaemolyticus
and its homolog in Escherichia coli.";
"Genome sequence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus: a pathogenic mechanism
distinct from that of V. cholerae.";
"The multidrug efflux protein NorM is a prototype of a new family of
transporters.";
"NorM of Vibrio parahaemolyticus is an Na(+)-driven multidrug efflux
pump.";
-!- FUNCTION: Multidrug efflux pump that functions as a Na(+)/drug
    antiporter. Confers resistance to several drugs, such as
    norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ethidium, kanamycin and streptomycin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the multi antimicrobial extrusion (MATE)
    (TC 2.A.66.1) family.
