AC   P04039;
Cytochrome c oxidase polypeptide VIII, mitochondrial precursor
(EC 1.9.3.1).
"COX8, the structural gene for yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunit
VIII. DNA sequence and gene disruption indicate that subunit VIII is
required for maximal levels of cellular respiration and is derived
from a precursor which is extended at both its NH2 and COOH termini.";
