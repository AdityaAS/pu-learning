AC   Q9S3K0;
Sugar efflux transporter A.
"Characterization of SotA and SotB, two Erwinia chrysanthemi proteins
which modify isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside and lactose
induction of the Escherichia coli lac promoter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the efflux of sugars. The physiological role
    may be the reduction of the intracellular concentration of toxic
    sugars or sugar metabolites. Transports IPTG, lactose and
    arabinose.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: Activated by cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Set
    transporter family.
