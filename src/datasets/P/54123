-!- FUNCTION: Iron transport multicopper ferroxidase required for
    Fe(2+) ion high affinity uptake. Required to oxidize Fe(2+) and
    release it from the transporter. Essential component of copper-
    dependent iron transport.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 4 copper ions per monomer (By similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P40088:FTR1; NbExp=3; IntAct=EBI-6876, EBI-7138;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein; extracellular side.
-!- INDUCTION: By iron deprivation. Repressed by iron excess.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1050 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the multicopper oxidase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 plastocyanin-like domains.
