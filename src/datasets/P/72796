AC   P31499;
Hemin receptor precursor.
"Hemin uptake system of Yersinia enterocolitica: similarities with
other TonB-dependent systems in Gram-negative bacteria.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is involved in the initial step of iron
    uptake by binding hemin, an iron chelatin siderophore that allows
    the bacteria to extract iron from the environment.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tonB-dependent receptor family.
