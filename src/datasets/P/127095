thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
"Efflux-dependent auxin gradients establish the apical-basal axis of
Arabidopsis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts as a component of the auxin efflux carrier.
    Mediates the initial auxin gradient which contributes to the
    establishment of the apical-basal axis in early embryogenesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q940Y5-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q940Y5-2; Sequence=VSP_009420, VSP_009421, VSP_009422;
      Note=May be due to a competing donor splice site and to an
      intron retention. No experimental confirmation available;
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed during early embryogenesis.
    Detected apically in the basal cell lineage resulting from the
    first zygotic division. At the 32-cell stage, localization shifts
    to the basal side of the cells in the developing embryo.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Loss-of-function mutants display altered embryo
    with defects in stereotypical pattern of early embryogenesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the auxin efflux carrier (TC 2.A.69)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
