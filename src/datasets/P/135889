AC   P46317;
Lichenan permease IIC component (PTS system lichenan-specific EIIC
component) (EIIC-Lic).
"Identification and characterization of a new beta-glucoside
utilization system in Bacillus subtilis.";
"Sequencing of a 65 kb region of the Bacillus subtilis genome
containing the lic and cel loci, and creation of a 177 kb contig
covering the gnt-sacXY region.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in lichenan transport.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by lichenan, lichenan hydrolysate and
    cellobiose. Subject to carbon catabolite repression.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIC domain forms the PTS system translocation channel
    and contains the specific substrate-binding site.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIC type-3 domain.
