-!- FUNCTION: This protein is a component of the leucine, isoleucine,
    valine, (threonine) transport system, which is one of the two
    periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport systems of the
    high-affinity transport of the branched-chain amino acids.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the leucine-binding protein family.
