-!- FUNCTION: This is a second nitrate reductase enzyme which can
    substitute for the NRA enzyme and allows E.coli to use nitrate as
    an electron acceptor during anaerobic growth. The gamma chain is a
    membrane-embedded heme-iron unit resembling cytochrome b, which
    transfers electrons from quinones to the beta subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nitrite + acceptor = nitrate + reduced
    acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 hemes per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer of heterotrimers each composed of an alpha, a beta
    and a gamma chain. Alpha and beta are catalytic chains; gamma
    chains are involved in binding the enzyme complex to the
    cytoplasmic membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
