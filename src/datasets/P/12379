-!- FUNCTION: This magnesium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis
    of ATP coupled with the transport of phospholipids (Potential).
    Seems to be involved in ribosome assembly.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O = ADP + phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with CDC50.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P32366:VMA6; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-3106, EBI-20201;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network; trans-
    Golgi network membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 606 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IV subfamily.
