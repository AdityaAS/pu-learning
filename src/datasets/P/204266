-!- FUNCTION: Forms calcium-sensitive chloride channels. May conduct
    other physiologically significant anions such as bicarbonate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer or pentamers. May interact with PPP2CB and
    PPP2R1B (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=4;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=O76090-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O76090-2; Sequence=VSP_000540;

    Name=4;
      IsoId=O76090-4; Sequence=VSP_008973, VSP_008975;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominantly expressed in the basolateral
    membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by PP2A (By similarity).
-!- DISEASE: Defects in BEST1 are the cause of Best macular dystrophy
    (BMD) [MIM:153700]; also known as vitelliform macular dystrophy
    type 2. BMD is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by
    typical "egg-yolk" macular lesions due to abnormal accumulation of
    lipofuscin within and beneath the retinal pigment epithelium
    cells. Progression of the disease leads to destruction of the
    retinal pigment epithelium and vision loss.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in BEST1 are a cause of juvenile-onset
    vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD) [MIM:153700].
-!- DISEASE: Defects in BEST1 are a cause of adult-onset vitelliform
    macular dystrophy (AVMD) [MIM:608161].
-!- DISEASE: Defects in BEST1 may be a cause of bull's eye maculopathy
    [MIM:153870].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bestrophin family.
