-!- FUNCTION: Amine transporter. Terminates the action of dopamine by
    its high affinity sodium-dependent reuptake into presynaptic
    terminals.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homooligomer; disulfide-linked. Interacts with PRKCABP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein is the target of psychomotor
    stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
