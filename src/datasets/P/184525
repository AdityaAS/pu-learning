AC   P0C0I3; P0A4K9; P21131; Q491F8;
Streptolysin O precursor (Thiol-activated cytolysin).
"Complete genome sequence of an M1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes.";
"Evolutionary origin and emergence of a highly successful clone of
serotype M1 group A Streptococcus involved multiple horizontal gene
transfer events.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sulfhydryl-activated toxin. Is able to lyse cholesterol
    containing membranes. Can be reversibly inactivated by oxidation.
    Cholesterol is the receptor for the binding of these toxins to
    eukaryotic cell membranes (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the thiol-activated cytolysin family.
