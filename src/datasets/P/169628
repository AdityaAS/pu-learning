AC   P26430;
Sodium/nucleoside cotransporter (Na(+)/nucleoside cotransporter).
"Cloning and functional expression of a mammalian Na+/nucleoside
cotransporter. A member of the SGLT family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Actively transports uridine into cells by Na(+)
    cotransport. May play a role in reabsorption of nucleosides from
    glomerular filtrate by the proximal tubule in kidney, and in the
    regulation of cardiac contractility by adenosine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: More abundant in heart than in kidney, where
    it is absent from the outer cortex.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:solute symporter (SSF)
    (TC 2.A.21) family.
