AC   Q01723;
Hypersensitivity response secretion protein hrpH precursor.
"The Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 hrpH product, an envelope
protein required for elicitation of the hypersensitive response in
plants.";
"The complete hrp gene cluster of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61
includes two blocks of genes required for harpinPss secretion that are
arranged colinearly with Yersinia ysc homologs.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the secretion of a proteinaceous elicitor of
    the hypersensitivity response in plants.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GSP D family.
