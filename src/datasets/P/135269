-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for phosphate; probably responsible for the translocation of the
    substrate across the membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. CysTW subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
