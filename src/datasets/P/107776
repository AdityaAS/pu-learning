AC   Q57603;
Hyperpolarization-activated voltage-gated potassium channel (MVP).
"Hyperpolarization moves S4 sensors inward to open MVP, a
methanococcal voltage-gated potassium channel.";
"Complete genome sequence of the methanogenic archaeon, Methanococcus
jannaschii.";
"MjK1, a K+ channel from M. jannaschii, mediates K+ uptake and K+
sensitivity in E. coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Voltage-gated potassium-selective channel opened by
    hyperpolarization.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The segment S4 is probably the voltage-sensor and is
    characterized by a series of positively charged amino acids.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibited by barium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family.
