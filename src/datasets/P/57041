-!- FUNCTION: Reductase activity that acts on Fe(3+)-chelates external
    to the cell. Plays a role in iron uptake. May participate in the
    transport of electrons from cytoplasm to an extracellular
    substrate (Fe(3+) ion) via FAD and heme intermediates. May also
    participate in Cu(2+) reduction and Cu(+) uptake.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 Fe(2+) + NAD(+) = 2 Fe(3+) + NADH.
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By iron deprivation. Repressed by iron uptake.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 892 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ferric oxidoreductase domain.
