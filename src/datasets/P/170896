AC   P0AGA0; P33582;
Protein-export membrane protein secG (Preprotein translocase band 1
subunit) (P12).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export. Participates in an early
    event of protein translocation (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secG family.
