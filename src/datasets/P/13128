AC   P40416;
Iron-sulfur clusters transporter ATM1, mitochondrial precursor.
"An ABC transporter in the mitochondrial inner membrane is required
for normal growth of yeast.";
"The ABC transporter Atm1p is required for mitochondrial iron
homeostasis.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
XIII.";
"The mitochondrial proteins Atm1p and Nfs1p are essential for
biogenesis of cytosolic Fe/S proteins.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
"The mitochondrial ABC transporter Atm1p functions as a homodimer.";
-!- FUNCTION: Performs an essential function in the generation of
    cytoplasmic iron-sulfur proteins by mediating export of Fe/S
    cluster precursors synthesized by NFS1 and other mitochondrial
    proteins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 3250 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
