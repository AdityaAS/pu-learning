Heme carrier protein 1.
"Complete sequencing and characterization of 21,243 full-length human
cDNAs.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Identification of an intestinal heme transporter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Intestinal heme transporter which mediates heme uptake
    from the gut lumen into duodenal epithelial cells; the iron is
    then released from heme and may be transported into the
    bloodstream. Dietary heme iron is an important nutritional source
    of iron (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; apical cell membrane; multi-
    pass membrane protein. Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Note=Localizes to the apical membrane of intestinal cells in iron-
    deficient cells, while it resides in internal cellular
    compartments in iron-replete animals.
