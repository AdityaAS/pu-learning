ABC transporter ced-7 (Cell death protein 7).
"The C. elegans cell corpse engulfment gene ced-7 encodes a protein
similar to ABC transporters.";
"2.2 Mb of contiguous nucleotide sequence from chromosome III of C.
elegans.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Functions in the engulfment of cell corpses during
    embryonic programed cell death to translocate molecules that
    mediate homotypic adhesion between cell surfaces of the dying and
    engulfing cells.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
      Comment=Experimental confirmation may be lacking for some
      isoforms;
    Name=c;
      IsoId=P34358-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=a;
      IsoId=P34358-2; Sequence=VSP_000044, VSP_000045;
    Name=b;
      IsoId=P34358-3; Sequence=VSP_000044;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous in embryos. Expressed in larval
    germline precursors. Expression in larvae and adults is seen in
    amphid sheath cells, pharyngeal-intestinal valve and phasmid
    sheath cells. Low levels of expression are also seen in gonadal
    sheath cells.
-!- DOMAIN: Multifunctional polypeptide with two homologous halves,
    each containing a hydrophobic membrane-anchoring domain and an ATP
    binding cassette (ABC) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. ABCA subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
