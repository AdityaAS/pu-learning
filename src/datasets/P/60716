AC   Q9ZAA8;
Glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase delta subunit (EC 4.1.1.70).
"The sodium ion translocating glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase from
Acidaminococcus fermentans: cloning and function of the genes forming
a second operon.";
-!- FUNCTION: Makes part of the primary sodium pump glutaconyl-CoA
    decarboxylase (GCD). Possible membrane anchor for the alpha
    subunit.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4-carboxybut-2-enoyl-CoA = but-2-enoyl-CoA +
    CO(2).
-!- PATHWAY: Anaerobic glutamate metabolism; fifth step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooctamer consisting of two alpha, two beta, two
    gamma and two delta subunits.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the oadG family.
