-!- FUNCTION: Part of an ATP-driven transport system troABCD for zinc.
    Substrate-binding protein involved in the transport of zinc across
    the cytoplasmic membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 9
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) thought to be an outer membrane
    protein with porin-like properties.
