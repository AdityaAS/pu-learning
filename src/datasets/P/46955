AC   Q945F0; Q9SVJ0;
Enhanced disease susceptibility 5 (Eds5) (Salicylic acid induction
deficient 1) (Sid1).
"EDS5, an essential component of salicylic acid-dependent signaling
for disease resistance in Arabidopsis, is a member of the MATE
transporter family.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 4 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays an essential function in the salicylic acid-
    dependent pathway of plant defense against pathogens. Might be
    part of the functional mechanism for the induction of salicylic
    acid biosynthesis. Might be a transporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: By salicylic acid, UV-C light and pathogens.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the multi antimicrobial extrusion (MATE)
    (TC 2.A.66.1) family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequences differ from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
