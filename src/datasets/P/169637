-!- FUNCTION: Mediates iodide uptake in the thyroid gland.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expression is primarily in thyroid tissue, but
    also to a lower extent in mammary gland and ovary. Expression is
    reduced in tumors.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC5A5 are the cause of iodide transport
    defect (ITD) [MIM:274400]. ITD is characterized by an inability of
    the thyroid to maintain a concentration difference of readily
    exchangeable iodine between the plasma and the thyroid gland. It
    is a cause of congenital hypothyroidism.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:solute symporter (SSF)
    (TC 2.A.21) family.
