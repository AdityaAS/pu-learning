-!- FUNCTION: NDH-1 shuttles electrons from NADH, via FMN and iron-
    sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the respiratory chain. The
    immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is
    believed to be ubiquinone. Couples the redox reaction to proton
    translocation (for every two electrons transferred, four hydrogen
    ions are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus
    conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + quinone = NAD(+) + quinol.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster per subunit. The 2Fe-2S cluster
    is known as N1b.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 4Fe-4S clusters per subunit. The 4Fe-4S cluster
    1 is known as N5 and 4Fe-4S cluster 2 as N4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of 14 different subunits.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I 75 kDa subunit family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domain.
