Peroxisome assembly protein 12 (Peroxin-12) (Peroxisome assembly
factor 3) (PAF-3).
"Isolation of the human PEX12 gene, mutated in group 3 of the
peroxisome biogenesis disorders.";
"PEX12, the pathogenic gene of group III Zellweger syndrome: cDNA
cloning by functional complementation on a CHO cell mutant, patient
analysis, and characterization of PEX12p.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"PEX19 binds multiple peroxisomal membrane proteins, is predominantly
cytoplasmic, and is required for peroxisome membrane synthesis.";
"Human pex19p binds peroxisomal integral membrane proteins at regions
distinct from their sorting sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for protein import into peroxisomes.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PEX5, PEX10 (By similarity). Interacts
    with PEX19 via its cytoplasmic domain.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P40855:PEX19; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-594836, EBI-594747;
    P50542:PEX5; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-594836, EBI-597835;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Peroxisome; peroxisomal membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PEX12 are a cause of peroxisome biogenesis
    disorders (PBD) [601539]; a group of genetically heterogeneous
    diseases usually lethal in early infancy. Patients exhibit a
    defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix
    proteins. PBD are, like the proteins of peroxisome biogenesis, a
    group of heterogeneous congenital diseases with more than 10
    complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being
    observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PEX12 are a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZS)
    [MIM:214100]; a severe peroxisome biogenesis disorder.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peroxin-12 family.
