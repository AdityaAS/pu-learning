AC   P37082;
Sorbose permease IIC component (PTS system sorbose-specific EIIC
component) (EIIC-Sor).
"Sequence of the sor-operon for L-sorbose utilization from Klebsiella
pneumoniae KAY2026.";
"Molecular analysis of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent L-sorbose:
phosphotransferase system from Klebsiella pneumoniae and of its
multidomain structure.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in sorbose transport.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIC domain forms the PTS system translocation channel
    and contains the specific substrate-binding site.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIC type-4 domain.
