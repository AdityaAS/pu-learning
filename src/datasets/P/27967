AC   O75746;
Calcium-binding mitochondrial carrier protein Aralar1 (Mitochondrial
aspartate glutamate carrier 1) (Solute carrier family 25 member 12).
"Molecular cloning of Aralar, a new member of the mitochondrial
carrier superfamily that binds calcium and is present in human muscle
and brain.";
"The gene mutated in adult-onset type II citrullinaemia encodes a
putative mitochondrial carrier protein.";
"Citrin and aralar1 are Ca(2+)-stimulated aspartate/glutamate
transporters in mitochondria.";
-!- FUNCTION: Calcium-dependent mitochondrial aspartate and glutamate
    carrier. May have a function in the urea cycle.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: High levels in heart and skeletal muscle, low
    in brain and very low in kidney.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Binds calcium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 EF-hand domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
