AC   P05695;
Porin P precursor (Outer membrane protein D1).
"Sequence and relatedness in other bacteria of the Pseudomonas
aeruginosa oprP gene coding for the phosphate-specific porin P.";
"Polyphosphate-selective porin OprO of Pseudomonas aeruginosa:
expression, purification and sequence.";
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
"Regulation of components of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa phosphate-
starvation-inducible regulon in Escherichia coli.";
"Large-scale purification and biochemical characterization of
crystallization-grade porin protein P from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.";
"Demonstration and chemical modification of a specific phosphate
binding site in the phosphate-starvation-inducible outer membrane
porin protein P of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Anion specific, the binding site has higher affinity for
    phosphate than chloride ions. Porin O has a higher affinity for
    polyphosphates (tripolyphosphate and pyrophosphate) while porin P
    has a higher affinity for orthophosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer. Trimer pore size is 0.6 nM.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the oprO/oprP family.
