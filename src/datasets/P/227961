-!- FUNCTION: Electron transfer subunit of the terminal reductase
    during anaerobic growth on various sulfoxide and N-oxide
    compounds.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 4 4Fe-4S clusters (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex consist of three subunits: ynfF, the
    reductase; ynfG, an electron transfer protein, and ynfH, a
    membrane anchor protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
