-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the export of copper out of the cells, such
    as the efflux of hepatic copper into the bile.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Cu(2+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    Cu(2+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer. Interacts with COMMD1/MURR1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network; trans-
    Golgi network membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By
    similarity). Isoform 2: Cytoplasm. WND/140 kDa: Mitochondrion.
    Note=Predominantly found in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Not
    redistributed to the plasma membrane in response to elevated
    copper levels. Plasma membrane in response to elevated copper
    levels. The cleaved form WND/140 kDa is located in mitochondria.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=4;
    Name=1; Synonyms=A;
      IsoId=P35670-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2; Synonyms=B;
      IsoId=P35670-2; Sequence=VSP_000426, VSP_000427;
    Name=3;
      IsoId=P35670-3; Sequence=VSP_016559;
    Name=4;
      IsoId=P35670-4; Sequence=VSP_016560;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Most abundant in liver and kidney and also
    found in brain. Isoform 2 is expressed in brain but not in liver.
    The cleaved form WND/140 kDa is found in liver cell lines and
    other tissues.
-!- PTM: Isoform 1 may be proteolytically cleaved at the N-terminus to
    produce the WND/140 kDa form.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in ATP7B are the cause of Wilson disease (WD)
    [MIM:277900]. WD is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper
    metabolism in which copper cannot be incorporated into
    ceruloplasmin in liver, and cannot be excreted from the liver into
    the bile. Copper accumulates in the liver and subsequently in the
    brain and kidney. The disease is characterized by neurologic
    manifestations and signs of cirrhosis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 HMA domains.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.6 sequences differ from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 456.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.8 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 830.
