Oligopeptide transporter 1 (Di-/tri-peptide transporter CPTA).
"Two oligopeptide transporters from Caenorhabditis elegans: molecular
cloning and functional expression.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Proton-dependent uptake of di- or tripeptides, and to a
    minor extent tetrapeptides. Transport is independent of sodium and
    chloride ions. Protein shows high affinity to peptide substrates.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Gradual increase in expression during
    development from embryo through to adult.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PTR2/POT transporter (TC 2.A.17)
    family.
