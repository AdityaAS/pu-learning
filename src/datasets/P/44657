AC   P26902; O34802;
D-aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.-).
"A Bacillus subtilis dipeptide transport system expressed early during
sporulation.";
"Sequence of the Bacillus subtilis genome between xlyA and ykoR.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"The dppA gene of Bacillus subtilis encodes a new D-aminopeptidase.";
"Structure of the Bacillus subtilis D-aminopeptidase DppA reveals a
novel self-compartmentalizing protease.";
-!- FUNCTION: Hydrolyzes N-terminal residues in D-amino acid
    containing peptides. Among the tested substrates, the highest
    activities are with D-Ala-D-Ala and D-Ala-Gly-Gly. The
    physiological role is not clear.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 zinc ions per subunit.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 9-11;
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodecamer. A 20 Angstroms wide channel runs through the
    complex, giving access to a central chamber holding the active
    sites.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed early during sporulation.
-!- INDUCTION: Nutrient deficiency conditions, which also induce
    sporulation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M55 family.
