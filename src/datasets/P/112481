AC   P08995;
Nodulin-26 (N-26).
"Soybean nodulin 26 is homologous to the major intrinsic protein of
the bovine lens fiber membrane.";
"Nodulin-26, a peribacteroid membrane nodulin is expressed
independently of the development of the peribacteroid compartment.";
"Determination of the site of phosphorylation of nodulin 26 by the
calcium-dependent protein kinase from soybean nodules.";
-!- FUNCTION: Aquaporins facilitate the transport of water and small
    neutral solutes across cell membranes. This aquaporin may function
    in transporting small molecules across the peribacteroid
    membranes.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Symbiosome; peribacteroid membrane; multi-
    pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: During nodulation in legume roots after Rhizobium
    infection.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family. NIP
    subfamily.
