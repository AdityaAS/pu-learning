AC   P77348;
Periplasmic murein peptide-binding protein precursor.
"MppA, a periplasmic binding protein essential for import of the
bacterial cell wall peptide L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-meso-
diaminopimelate.";
"A 570-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 28.0-40.1 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential for the uptake of the murein peptide L-alanyl-
    gamma-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelate. Also transports some alpha-
    linked peptides such as Pro-Phe-Lys with low affinity. The
    transport is effected by the oligopeptide permease system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 5
    family.
