-!- FUNCTION: Involved in lipid A export and possibly also in
    glycerophospholipid export and for biogenesis of the outer
    membrane. Transmembrane domains (TMD) form a pore in the inner
    membrane and the ATP-binding domain (NBD) is responsible for
    energy generation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- DOMAIN: In msbA the ATP-binding domain (NBD) and the transmembrane
    domain (TMD) are fused.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Lipid exporter
    (TC 3.A.1.106) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
