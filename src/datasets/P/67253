-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for glutamate. L-glutamate acts as an
    excitatory neurotransmitter at many synapses in the central
    nervous system. The postsynaptic actions of Glu are mediated by a
    variety of receptors that are named according to their selective
    agonists. This receptor binds AMPA(quisqualate) > glutamate >
    kainate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds to DLG1.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P70569:Myo5b; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-371642, EBI-975940;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Flop;
      IsoId=P19490-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Flip;
      IsoId=P19490-2; Sequence=VSP_000097, VSP_000098, VSP_000099,
                               VSP_000100, VSP_000101;
-!- PTM: Palmitoylated. Depalmitoylated upon glutamate stimulation.
    Cys-603 palmitoylation leads to Golgi retention and decreased cell
    surface expression. In contrast, Cys-829 palmitoylation does not
    affect cell surface expression but regulates stimulation-dependent
    endocytosis (By similarity).
-!- POLYMORPHISM: Both variants Ser-710 and Thr-710 are phosphorylated
    at this position.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glutamate-gated ion channel (TC 1.A.10)
    family.
