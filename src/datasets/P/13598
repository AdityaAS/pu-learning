ATP synthase protein 9, mitochondrial (EC 3.6.3.14) (Lipid-binding
protein).
"Comparative analysis of the region of the mitochondrial genome
containing the ATPase subunit 9 gene in the two related yeast species
Saccharomyces douglasii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is one of the chains of the nonenzymatic
    membrane component (F0) of mitochondrial ATPase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. In yeast, the
    dimeric form of ATP synthase consists of 18 polypeptides: alpha,
    beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, 4 (B), 5 (OSCP), 6 (A), 8, 9 (C), d,
    E (Tim11), f, g, h, i, j and k.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase C chain family.
