AC   O76094;
Signal recognition particle 72 kDa protein (SRP72).
"Protein SRP72 sequence of human signal recognition particle.";
"Sequence of human signal recognition particle (SRP) 72.";
-!- FUNCTION: Signal-recognition-particle assembly has a crucial role
    in targeting secretory proteins to the rough endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane. Binds the 7S RNA only in presence of SRP68. This
    ribonucleoprotein complex might interact directly with the docking
    protein in the ER membrane and possibly participate in the
    elongation arrest function.
-!- SUBUNIT: Signal recognition particle consists of a 7S RNA molecule
    of 300 nucleotides and six protein subunits: SRP72, SRP68, SRP54,
    SRP19, SRP14 and SRP9.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- DOMAIN: The C-terminus is essential for the interaction with the
    SRP68/7S RNA complex (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SRP72 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 TPR repeats.
