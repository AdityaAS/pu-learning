AC   Q9GKY1; Q9GKY2;
Anion exchange protein 4 (Anion exchanger 4) (Solute carrier family 4
member 9).
"A new member of the HCO3-transporter superfamily is an apical anion
exchanger of beta-intercalated cells in the kidney.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable apical anion exchanger of the beta-intercalated
    cells of kidney. May participate in HCO3(-) secretion.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; apical cell membrane; multi-
    pass membrane protein. Note=In contrast to the rat ortholog, it is
    present on apical membrane of cortical kidney cells.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1; Synonyms=AE4a;
      IsoId=Q9GKY1-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2; Synonyms=AE4b;
      IsoId=Q9GKY1-2; Sequence=VSP_007088;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in kidney. Expressed in
    certain types of cells in the kidney cortex.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the anion exchanger (TC 2.A.31) family.
