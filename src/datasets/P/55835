Flagellar motor switch protein fliN.
"Flagellar switch of Salmonella typhimurium: gene sequences and
deduced protein sequences.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"The FliO, FliP, FliQ, and FliR proteins of Salmonella typhimurium:
putative components for flagellar assembly.";
-!- FUNCTION: FliN is one of three proteins (fliG, fliN, fliM) that
    form a switch complex that is proposed to be located at the base
    of the basal body. This complex interacts with the cheY and cheZ
    chemotaxis proteins, in addition to contacting components of the
    motor that determine the direction of flagellar rotation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fliN/mopA/spaO family.
