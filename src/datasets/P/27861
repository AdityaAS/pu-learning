AC   P60000;
Chlorate reductase subunit gamma precursor (Chlorate reductase heme
subunit).
"A gene cluster for chlorate metabolism in Ideonella dechloratans.";
-!- FUNCTION: May transfer electrons to the iron-sulfur centers of
    clrB.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 heme B (iron-protoporphyrin IX) group per
    subunit (Potential).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimer of alpha, beta and gamma subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Has potential use in bioremediation of waste sites
    contaminated with chlorate, such as pulp and paper industry
    wastewater.
