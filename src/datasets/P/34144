-!- FUNCTION: Required for high affinity copper (probably reduced Cu
    I) transport into the cell.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic vesicle; cytoplasmic vesicle
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By copper deprivation and repressed by copper excess.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC31A transporter family.
