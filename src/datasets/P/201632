Vacuolar ATP synthase 16 kDa proteolipid subunit (EC 3.6.3.14)
(Ductin) (VHA16K).
"Sequence of a cDNA from Drosophila coding for the 16 kD proteolipid
component of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase.";
"Evidence that the 16 kDa proteolipid (subunit c) of the vacuolar
H(+)- ATPase and ductin from gap junctions are the same polypeptide in
Drosophila and Manduca: molecular cloning of the Vha16k gene from
Drosophila.";

-!- FUNCTION: Proton-conducting pore forming subunit of the membrane
    integral V0 complex of vacuolar ATPase. V-ATPase is responsible
    for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in
    eukaryotic cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (main components: subunits A, B,
    C, D, E, and F) attached to an integral membrane V0 proton pore
    complex (main component: the proteolipid protein; which is present
    as a hexamer that forms the proton-conducting pore).
-!- INTERACTION:
    O76892:Scg-delta; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-185634, EBI-158358;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase proteolipid subunit family.
