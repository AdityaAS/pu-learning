Flagellar biosynthetic protein fliQ.
"The FliO, FliP, FliQ, and FliR proteins of Salmonella typhimurium:
putative components for flagellar assembly.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the assembly of the rivet at the earliest
    stage of flagellar biosynthesis (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fliQ/mopD/spaQ family.
