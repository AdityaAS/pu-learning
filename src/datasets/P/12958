-!- FUNCTION: One of the components of the high-affinity ATP-driven
    potassium transport (or KDP) system, which catalyzes the
    hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of hydrogen and
    potassium ions.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + K(+)(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    K(+)(In).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IA subfamily.
