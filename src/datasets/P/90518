AC   Q63016; Q9QWL4;
Large neutral amino acids transporter small subunit 1 (L-type amino
acid transporter 1) (4F2 light chain) (4F2 LC) (4F2LC) (Integral
membrane protein E16) (TA1 protein).
"Expression cloning and characterization of a transporter for large
neutral amino acids activated by the heavy chain of 4F2 antigen
(CD98).";
"TA1, a highly conserved oncofetal complementary DNA from rat
hepatoma, encodes an integral membrane protein associated with liver
development, carcinogenesis, and cell activation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium-independent, high-affinity transport of large
    neutral amino acids. Involved in cellular amino acid uptake.
-!- SUBUNIT: Disulfide-linked heterodimer with the amino acid
    transport protein SLC3A2/4F2hc.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed hepatoma but not in normal liver.
    Also expressed in placenta, testis, brain, ovary, spleen, mammary
    gland, and uterus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) (TC 2.A.3.8)
    family.
