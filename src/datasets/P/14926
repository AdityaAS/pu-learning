AC   P09457;

(Oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein) (OSCP) (ATP synthase chain
5).

-!- FUNCTION: This protein seems to be part of the stalk that links
    CF(0) to CF(1). It either transmits conformational changes from
    CF(0) into CF(1) or is implicated in proton conduction.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 32400 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase delta chain family.
