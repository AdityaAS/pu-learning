AC   P39603;
Spore morphogenesis and germination protein ywcE.
"Bacillus subtilis genome project: cloning and sequencing of the 97 kb
region from 325 degrees to 333 degrees.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"A gene encoding a holin-like protein involved in spore morphogenesis
and spore germination in Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for proper spore morphogenesis. Important for
    spore germination.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Note=Inner and outer prespore membrane. Mother cell membrane.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed at the onset of sporulation.
-!- INDUCTION: Repressed by abrB during growth and activated at the
    onset of sporulation in a spo0A-dependent manner.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ywcE family.
