AC   P53507;
Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM7 (Translocase of outer
membrane 7 kDa subunit).
"Tom7 modulates the dynamics of the mitochondrial outer membrane
translocase and plays a pathway-related role in protein import.";

-!- FUNCTION: Component of the TOM (translocase of outer membrane)
    receptor complex responsible for the recognition and translocation
    of cytosolically synthesized mitochondrial preproteins. TOM7 is
    involved in assembly and stability of the TOM complex.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms part of the TOM (translocase of outer membrane)
    complex that consists of at least 7 different proteins (TOM5,
    TOM6, TOM7, TOM20, TOM22, TOM40 and TOM70).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 3250 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tom7 family.
