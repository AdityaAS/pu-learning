Protein tolA.
"Nucleotide sequences of the tolA and tolB genes and localization of
their products, components of a multistep translocation system in
Escherichia coli.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"TolA: a membrane protein involved in colicin uptake contains an
extended helical region.";
"TolA central domain interacts with Escherichia coli porins.";
"Filamentous phage infection: crystal structure of g3p in complex with
its coreceptor, the C-terminal domain of TolA.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the tonB-independent uptake of group A
    colicins (colicins A, E1, E2, E3, and K). Necessary for the
    colicins to reach their respective targets after initial binding
    to the bacteria. Also involved in the translocation of
    bacteriophage DNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts, via domain II, with porins ompC, phoE and
    lamB.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass type II
    membrane protein.
