AC   P31602;
Citrate-sodium symporter (Citrate transporter) (Citrate carrier
protein).
"Nucleotide sequence and functional properties of a sodium-dependent
citrate transport system from Klebsiella pneumoniae.";
"Membrane topology of the sodium ion-dependent citrate carrier of
Klebsiella pneumoniae. Evidence for a new structural class of
secondary transporters.";
-!- FUNCTION: Uptake of citrate across the boundary membrane with the
    concomitant uptake of a sodium ion (symport system).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Allows the utilization of citrate as a sole source
    of carbon and energy.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:citrate (SCF) symporter family.
