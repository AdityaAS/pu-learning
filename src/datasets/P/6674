"Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase-coding gene of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the uptake of ammonia and methylammonia.
    Utilizes uniport of ammonium and uses the membrane potential as
    driving force.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrogen starvation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ammonium transporter (TC 2.A.49)
    family.
