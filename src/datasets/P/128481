NAD(P) transhydrogenase subunit beta (EC 1.6.1.2) (Pyridine nucleotide
transhydrogenase subunit beta) (Nicotinamide nucleotide
transhydrogenase subunit beta) (Proton-translocating transhydrogenase
NADP(H)-binding component) (dIII).
"Energy-transducing nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase:
nucleotide sequences of the genes and predicted amino acid sequences
of the subunits of the enzyme from Rhodospirillum rubrum.";
"Solution structure of the NADP(H)-binding component (dIII) of proton-
translocating transhydrogenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum.";
"The crystal structure of an asymmetric complex of the two nucleotide
binding components of proton-translocating transhydrogenase.";
-!- FUNCTION: The transhydrogenation between NADH and NADP is coupled
    to respiration and ATP hydrolysis and functions as a proton pump
    across the membrane (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADPH + NAD(+) = NADP(+) + NADH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex of an alpha and a beta chain; in Rhodospirillum,
    the alpha chain seems to be made of two subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PNT beta subunit family.
