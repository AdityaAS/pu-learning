AC   Q9C4Z5;
Aquaporin aqpM.
"Rapid amplification of a water channel-like gene and its flanking
sequences from the Methanothermobacter marburgensis genome using a
single primer PCR strategy.";
"Functional expression and characterization of an archaeal aquaporin.
AqpM from Methanothermobacter marburgensis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Channel that permits osmotically driven movement of
    water in both directions. It mediates rapid entry or exit of water
    in response to abrupt changes in osmolarity. Exhibits also a
    transient but reproducible increase in the initial glycerol flux.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
