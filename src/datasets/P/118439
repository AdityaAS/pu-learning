-!- FUNCTION: This protein is a component of the oligopeptide
    permease, a binding protein-dependent transport system, it binds
    peptides up to five amino acids long with high affinity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 5
    family.
