ComE operon protein 1.
"Characterization of comE, a late competence operon of Bacillus
subtilis required for the binding and uptake of transforming DNA.";
"Systematic sequencing of the 283 kb 210 degrees-232 degrees region of
the Bacillus subtilis genome containing the skin element and many
sporulation genes.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"ComEA, a Bacillus subtilis integral membrane protein required for
genetic transformation, is needed for both DNA binding and
transport.";
-!- FUNCTION: Needed for both DNA binding and transport. It is
    absolutely required for the uptake of transforming DNA but not for
    binding. Its role in binding may be indirect.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 HhH domains.
