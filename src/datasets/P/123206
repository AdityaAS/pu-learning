-!- FUNCTION: Transporter, whose physiological function is not yet
    established. Confers resistance to the chemicals cycloheximide and
    sulfomethuron methyl. Exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase activity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 42000 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. PDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 61.
