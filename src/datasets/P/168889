-!- FUNCTION: Electroneutral sodium- and bicarbonate-dependent
    cotransporter with a Na(+):HCO3(-) 1:1 stoichiometry. Regulates
    intracellular pH and may play a role in bicarbonate salvage in
    secretory epithelia. May also have an associated sodium channel
    activity.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Transporter activity is regulated by
    CA2/carbonic anhydrase 2, cAMP and PKA. Insensitive to stilbene
    derivatives. May be inhibited by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride
    (EIPA) (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with USH1C. Forms a complex with ATP6V1B1 and
    SLC9A3R1/EBP50. Interacts in a pH dependent-manner with
    CA2/carbonic anhydrase 2 (By similarity). Interacts with CFTR
    probably through SLC9A3R1/EBP50.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; basolateral cell membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein. Note=Also described at the apical
    cell membrane. Localizes to the stereocilia of cochlear outer hair
    cells and to the lateral membrane of cochlear inner hair cells.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in aorta, ventricles, atrium,
    mesenteric artery, kidney, spleen, duodenum, jejunum, ileum,
    colon, lung, trachea, gastric fundus and pylorus, cerebrum,
    cerebellum, pancreas, liver, parotid gland, and epididymis.
    Expressed in the inner ear by cochlear outer and inner hair cells
    (at protein level). Highly expressed in testis and spleen. Also
    detected in heart, brain, lung, liver and kidney. Isoform 4 and
    isoform 5 are specifically expressed in kidney. Isoform 6 is
    specifically expressed in hippocampal neurons.
-!- INDUCTION: Up-regulated in kidney upon metabolic acidosis.
-!- DOMAIN: The PDZ-binding motif mediates interaction with the CFTR,
    SLC9A3R1/EBP50 complex and probably with USH1C (By similarity).
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the anion exchanger (TC 2.A.31) family.
