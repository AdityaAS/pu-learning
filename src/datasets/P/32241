Pesticidal crystal protein cry1Aa (Insecticidal delta-endotoxin
CryIA(a)) (Crystaline entomocidal protoxin) (133 kDa crystal protein).
"The amino acid sequence of a crystal protein from Bacillus
thuringiensis deduced from the DNA base sequence.";
"Cloning and nucleotide sequence of a novel cry1Aa-type gene from
Bacillus thuringiensis subsp.kurstaki.";
"Transcriptional and translational start sites for the Bacillus
thuringiensis crystal protein gene.";
"Bacillus thuringiensis CryIA(a) insecticidal toxin: crystal structure
and channel formation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Promotes colloidosmotic lysis by binding to the midgut
    epithelial cells of many lepidopteran larvae.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: The crystal protein is produced during
    sporulation and is accumulated both as an inclusion and as part of
    the spore coat.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Toxic segment of the protein is located in the N-
    terminus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the delta endotoxin family.
