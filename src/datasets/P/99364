AC   P34886; P37087;
Degenerin mec-10 (Mechanosensory abnormality protein 10).
"Gene interactions affecting mechanosensory transduction in
Caenorhabditis elegans.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
"The mechanosensory protein MEC-6 is a subunit of the C. elegans
touch-cell degenerin channel.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable sodium channel subunit. May be needed for
    mechanosensory transduction (touch sensitivity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The channel is probably composed of at least the mec-2,
    mec-4, mec-6 and mec-10 subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel
    family.
