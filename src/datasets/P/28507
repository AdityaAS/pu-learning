AC   P79755;
Complement component C9 precursor.
"Cloning and sequencing of complement component C9 and its linkage to
DOC-2 in the pufferfish Fugu rubripes.";
-!- FUNCTION: C9 is the final component of the complement system to be
    added in the assembly of the membrane attack complex. It is able
    to enter lipid bilayers, forming transmembrane channels (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complement C6/C7/C8/C9 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 EGF-like domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 LDL-receptor class A domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 MACPF domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 TSP type-1 domains.
