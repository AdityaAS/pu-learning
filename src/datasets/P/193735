Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2
(TrpV2) (osm-9-like TRP channel 2) (OTRPC2) (Growth factor-regulated
calcium channel) (GRC).

insulin-like growth factor-I.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The neuropeptide head activator induces activation and translocation
of the growth-factor-regulated Ca(2+)-permeable channel GRC.";
-!- FUNCTION: Calcium-permeable, non-selective cation channel with an
    outward rectification. Seems to be regulated, at least in part, by
    IGF-I, PDGF and neuropeptide head activator. May transduce
    physical stimuli in mast cells. Activated by temperatures higher
    than 52 degrees Celsius; is not activated by vanilloids and acidic
    pH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (Probable). Interacts with a cAMP-dependent
    protein kinase type II regulatory subunit (PRKAR2A or PRKAR2B) and
    ACBD3. Interacts with RGA (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Cytoplasm. Note=Translocates from the cytoplasm to the plasma
    membrane upon ligand stimulation.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Abundantly expressed in spleen, lung and
    brain.
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by PKA (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. TrpV
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 ANK repeats.
