AC   Q54450;
Hemophore HasA (Heme acquisition system protein A).
"Iron acquisition from heme and hemoglobin by a Serratia marcescens
extracellular protein.";
"Purification and characterization of an extracellular heme-binding
protein, HasA, involved in heme iron acquisition.";
"A new type of hemophore-dependent heme acquisition system of Serratia
marcescens reconstituted in Escherichia coli.";
"The crystal structure of HasA, a hemophore secreted by Serratia
marcescens.";
"Functional aspects of the heme bound hemophore HasA by structural
analysis of various crystal forms.";
-!- FUNCTION: Can bind free heme and also acquire it from hemoglobin.
    Conveys heme from hemoglobin to the HasR receptor which releases
    it into the bacterium. HasR alone can take up heme but the synergy
    between HasA and HasR increases heme uptake 100-fold.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By iron depletion.
