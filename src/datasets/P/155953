Electron transport complex protein rnfB (Nitrogen fixation protein
rnfB).
"Identification of a new class of nitrogen fixation genes in
Rhodobacter capsulatus: a putative membrane complex involved in
electron transport to nitrogenase.";
"Nucleotide sequence and genetic analysis of the region essential for
functional expression of the gene for ferredoxin I, fdxN, in

-!- FUNCTION: Required for nitrogen fixation. May be part of a
    membrane complex functioning as an intermediate in the electron
    transport to nitrogenase. Stabilizes rnfC.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster (Potential).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 4Fe-4S clusters (Potential).
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of at least six subunits; rnfA, rnfB, rnfC,
    rnfD, rnfE and rnfG.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Cell inner membrane; peripheral
    membrane protein (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: Expression is reduced under iron-limiting conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 4Fe4S bacterial-type ferredoxin family.
    RnfB subfamily.
