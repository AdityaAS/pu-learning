Inner membrane protein ALBINO3, chloroplast precursor.
"ALBINO3, an Arabidopsis nuclear gene essential for chloroplast
differentiation, encodes a chloroplast protein that shows homology to
proteins present in bacterial membranes and yeast mitochondria.";

"Chloroplast Oxa1p homolog albino3 is required for post-translational
integration of the light harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein into
thylakoid membranes.";
"Distinct Albino3-dependent and -independent pathways for thylakoid
membrane protein insertion.";
"Chloroplast YidC homolog Albino3 can functionally complement the
bacterial YidC depletion strain and promote membrane insertion of both
bacterial and chloroplast thylakoid proteins.";

translocase in thylakoids: substrate not required.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the insertion of some light harvesting
    chlorophyll-binding proteins (LHCP) into the chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane. Required for the insertion of LHCB1, LHCB4.1 and LHCB5
    proteins into thylakoid membrane, while it is not required for
    insertion of proteins psbX, psbW and psbY.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a complex with CPFTSY and the signal recognition
    particle (cpSRP).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
