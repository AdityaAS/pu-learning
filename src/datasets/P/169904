Sodium channel subunit beta-2 precursor.
"Structure and function of the beta 2 subunit of brain sodium
channels, a transmembrane glycoprotein with a CAM motif.";
"Interaction of voltage-gated sodium channels with the extracellular
matrix molecules tenascin-C and tenascin-R.";
"Role of auxiliary beta1-, beta2-, and beta3-subunits and their
interaction with Na(v)1.8 voltage-gated sodium channel.";
-!- FUNCTION: Crucial in the assembly, expression, and functional
    modulation of the heterotrimeric complex of the sodium channel.
    The subunit beta-2 causes an increase in the plasma membrane
    surface area and in its folding into microvilli. Interacts with
    TNR may play a crucial role in clustering and regulation of
    activity of sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier.
-!- SUBUNIT: The sodium channel consists of a pore-forming alpha
    subunit, beta-1 and beta-2 subunits. Beta-1 is non-covalently
    associated with alpha, while beta-2 is covalently linked by
    disulfide bonds. Interaction with SCN10A and TNR.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain specific.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Detected in the earliest phase of
    neurogenesis in brain, and expression is greatly increased
    concomitant with axon extension and synaptogenesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
