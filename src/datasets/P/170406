of the sdaCB operon in Escherichia coli K12.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";

proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the import of serine into the cell. May be
    required for phage C1 adsorption by interacting with drcB. May
    also be involved in ampicillin sensitivity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By leucine and by growth in rich medium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid/polyamine transporter 2
    family. SdaC/tdcC subfamily.
