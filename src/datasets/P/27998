Chloramphenicol resistance protein.
"Characterization of the nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance
(cmlA) gene of the In4 integron of Tn1696: similarity of the product
to transmembrane transport proteins.";
"Sequence analysis of the inducible chloramphenicol resistance
determinant in the Tn1696 integron suggests regulation by
translational attenuation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Appears to provoke a reduction of the content of the
    major porins ompA and ompC.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Bcr/cmlA
    family.
