-!- FUNCTION: Formate dehydrogenase allows E.coli to use formate as
    major electron donor during anaerobic respiration, when nitrate is
    used as electron acceptor. The alpha subunit forms the active
    site.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Formate + NAD(+) = CO(2) + NADH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 molybdenum ion per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) groups
    per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster per subunit.
-!- PATHWAY: Anaerobic nitrate respiration.
-!- SUBUNIT: Trimer of heterotrimers, consisting of subunits alpha,
    beta and gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrate under anaerobic conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family.
