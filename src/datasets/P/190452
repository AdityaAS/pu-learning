-!- FUNCTION: Interacts with outer membrane receptor proteins that
    carry out high-affinity binding and energy dependent uptake into
    the periplasmic space of specific substrates such as cobalamin,
    and various iron compounds (such as iron dicitrate, enterochelin,
    aerobactin, etc.). In the absence of tonB these receptors bind
    their substrates but do not carry out active transport. TonB also
    interacts with some colicins and is involved in the energy-
    dependent, irreversible steps of bacteriophages phi 80 and T1
    infection. It could act to transduce energy from the cytoplasmic
    membrane to specific energy-requiring processes in the outer
    membrane, resulting in the release into the periplasm of ligands
    bound by these outer membrane proteins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Forms a complex with the accessory proteins
    exbB and exbD.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass membrane
    protein; periplasmic side.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tonB family.
