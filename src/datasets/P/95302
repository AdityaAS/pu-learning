regulation of murein hydrolase activity and penicillin tolerance.";

programmed cell death.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits the expression or activity of extracellular
    murein hydrolases by interacting, possibly with lrgB, with the
    holin-like proteins cidA and/or cidB. The lrgAB and cidAB proteins
    may affect the proton motive force of the membrane. Increases
    tolerance to penicillin possibly by inhibiting the formation of
    the cidAB holin-like complexes within the membrane, thus reducing
    penicillin-induced lethality. Possibly plays a role in programmed
    cell death (PCD), triggering PCD in response to penicillin, and
    possibly other antibiotics, and environmental stresses.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Regulated by the two-component system lytR/lytS.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cidA/lrgA family. LrgA subfamily.
