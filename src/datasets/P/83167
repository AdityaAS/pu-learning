-!- FUNCTION: Minor myo-inositol uptake transporter.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate metabolism; myo-inositol degradation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The growth-defect caused by the iolF inactivation
    was only observed in the iolT-null background.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
