AC   P18895;
Alginate production protein algE precursor.
"Nucleotide sequence and expression of the algE gene involved in
alginate biosynthesis by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.";
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
"Overexpression of algE in Escherichia coli: subcellular localization,
purification, and ion channel properties.";
-!- FUNCTION: Has non-porin-like, channel-forming properties and
    probably functions as an alginate permeability pore.
-!- PATHWAY: Alginate biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the algE family.
