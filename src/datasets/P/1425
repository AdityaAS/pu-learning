-!- FUNCTION: Binds heme and porphyrins and functions in their ATP-
    dependent uptake into the mitochondria. Plays a crucial role in
    heme synthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=4;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q9NP58-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q9NP58-2; Sequence=VSP_021971;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
    Name=3;
      IsoId=Q9NP58-3; Sequence=VSP_021974, VSP_021975;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
    Name=4;
      IsoId=Q9NP58-4; Sequence=VSP_021972, VSP_021973;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Highest expression in heart
    and skeletal muscles.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Highly expressed in fetal liver.
-!- INDUCTION: Up-regulated by cellular porphyrins (at protein level).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Depletion of Abcb6 by RNAi abrogates heme
    biosynthesis. Overexpression enhances porphyrin biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.4 (BAD18782) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a stop codon at position 168 which was translated as Trp to extend
    the sequence.
