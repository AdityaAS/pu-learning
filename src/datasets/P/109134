-!- FUNCTION: Outer membrane channel protein allowing the entry of N-
    acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or sialic acid) into the bacteria.
    NanC proteins form high-conductance channels which are open at low
    membrane potentials and which have a weak anion selectivity (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the oligogalacturonate-specific porin kdgM
    (TC 1.B.35) family. NanC subfamily.
