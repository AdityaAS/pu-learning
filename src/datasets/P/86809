Potassium voltage-gated channel protein Shaw (Shaw2).
"K+ current diversity is produced by an extended gene family conserved
in Drosophila and mouse.";

Drosophila.";

systematic review.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the voltage-dependent potassium ion
    permeability of excitable membranes. Assuming opened or closed
    conformations in response to the voltage difference across the
    membrane, the protein forms a potassium-selective channel through
    which potassium ions may pass in accordance with their
    electrochemical gradient.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer of potassium channel proteins (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The segment S4 is probably the voltage-sensor and
    is characterized by a series of positively charged amino acids at
    every third position.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This channel protein belongs to the delayed
    rectifier class.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family. C (Shaw)
    subfamily.
