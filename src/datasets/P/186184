-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the import of threonine and serine into the
    cell. Uses hydrogen cation for cotransport (symport system).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid/polyamine transporter 2
    family. SdaC/tdcC subfamily.
