-!- FUNCTION: NDH-1 shuttles electrons from NADH, via FMN and iron-
    sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the respiratory chain. The
    immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is
    believed to be ubiquinone. Couples the redox reaction to proton
    translocation (for every two electrons transferred, four hydrogen
    ions are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus
    conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + quinone = NAD(+) + quinol.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 4Fe-4S clusters per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: NDH-1 is composed of 13 different subunits. Subunits
    nuoA, H, J, K, L, M, N constitute the membrane sector of the
    complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I 23 kDa subunit family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
