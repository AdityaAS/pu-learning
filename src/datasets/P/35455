Cytochrome c1 precursor.
"The genes of the Paracoccus denitrificans bc1 complex. Nucleotide
sequence and homologies between bacterial and mitochondrial
subunits.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase
    complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), which is a
    respiratory chain that generates an electrochemical potential
    coupled to ATP synthesis. c1 functions as an electron donor to
    cytochrome c.
-!- SUBUNIT: The main subunits of complex b-c1 are: cytochrome b,
    cytochrome c1 and the Rieske protein.
-!- PTM: Binds 1 heme group per subunit.
