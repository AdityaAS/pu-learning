AC   P21441;
Multidrug resistance protein (EC 3.6.3.44) (P-glycoprotein).
"The amplified H circle of methotrexate-resistant Leishmania
tarentolae contains a novel P-glycoprotein gene.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + xenobiotic(In) = ADP + phosphate
    + xenobiotic(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: In this organism, this protein is encoded by a
    gene, located in "H circle", a 68 kb duplex DNA circle containing
    a 30 kb inverted repeat. Acquired resistance to methotrexate in
    the organism is associated with the amplification of h circles
    with increasing level of LTPGPA gene transcription.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transmembrane type-1 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
 GO:0008559; F:xenobiotic-transporting ATPase activity; IEA:EC.
