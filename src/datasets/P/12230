-!- FUNCTION: This is the catalytic component of the active enzyme,
    which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of
    sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This action
    creates the electrochemical gradient of sodium and potassium ions,
    providing the energy for active transport of various nutrients.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Na(+)(In) + K(+)(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + Na(+)(Out) + K(+)(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of three subunits: alpha (catalytic), beta and
    gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Long;
      IsoId=P05023-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Short;
      IsoId=P05023-2; Sequence=VSP_000415, VSP_000416;
      Note=May be produced at very low levels due to a premature stop
      codon in the mRNA, leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay;
-!- PTM: Phosphorylation on Tyr-10 modulates pumping activity (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IIC subfamily.
