AC   P76398; O08005;
Multidrug resistance protein mdtB (Multidrug transporter mdtB).
"The putative response regulator BaeR stimulates multidrug resistance
of Escherichia coli via a novel multidrug exporter system, MdtABC.";
"A 460-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 40.1-50.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"The baeSR two-component regulatory system activates transcription of
the yegMNOB (mdtABCD) transporter gene cluster in Escherichia coli and
increases its resistance to novobiocin and deoxycholate.";
-!- FUNCTION: The mdtABC tripartite complex confers resistance against
    novobiocin and deoxycholate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of a tripartite efflux system composed of mdtA, mdtB
    and mdtC. MdtB forms a heteromultimer with mdtC.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: The mdtABC operon is transcriptionally activated by
    baeR.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: MdtABC requires tolC for its function.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acrB/acrD/acrF (TC 2.A.6) family.
