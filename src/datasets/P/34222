Cytotoxin precursor (Leucocidin).
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytotoxin: the nucleotide sequence of the gene
and the mechanism of activation of the protoxin.";
"The cytotoxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: cytotoxicity requires
proteolytic activation.";
"Purification and characterization of cytotoxin from the crude extract
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytotoxin is thought to form hydrophilic pores in cell
    membranes.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Note=Produced as a cell-associated inactive
    precursor which is not secreted extracellularly. The toxin is
    converted into its active form by the action of proteases
    concomitantly with cell lysis and is released into the medium.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein toxin may be one of the virulence
    factors because it shows strong cytotoxic effects on most
    eukaryotic cells, especially leukocytes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aerolysin family.
Direct protein sequencing; Toxin; Virulence.
