AC   P32758;
Capsule polysaccharide export outer membrane protein ctrA precursor.
"Conserved outer membrane protein of Neisseria meningitidis involved
in capsule expression.";
"Complete DNA sequence of a serogroup A strain of Neisseria
meningitidis Z2491.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in transport of capsular polysaccharides to the
    cell surface. May function as a membrane anchor for capsular
    polysaccharides. Possible porin properties.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bexD/ctrA/vexA family.
