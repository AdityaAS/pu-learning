-!- FUNCTION: This carrier protein is part of the Na(+)-independent,
    binding-protein-independent glutamate-aspartate transport system.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Glutamate uptake was inhibited by L-cysteate
    and beta-hydroxyaspartate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:dicarboxylate (SDF) symporter
    (TC 2.A.23) family.
