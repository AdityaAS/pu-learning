AC   P48770;
Complement component C9 precursor.
"Chimeric horse/human recombinant C9 proteins identify the amino acid
sequence in horse C9 responsible for restriction of hemolysis.";
-!- FUNCTION: C9 is the final component of the complement system to be
    added in the assembly of the membrane attack complex. It is able
    to enter lipid bilayers, forming transmembrane channels.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- PTM: Thrombin cleaves factor C9 to produce C9a and C9b.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complement C6/C7/C8/C9 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 EGF-like domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 LDL-receptor class A domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 MACPF domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 TSP type-1 domain.
