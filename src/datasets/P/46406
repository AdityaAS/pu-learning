AC   P31596;
Excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (Sodium-dependent
glutamate/aspartate transporter 2) (GLUT-R) (GLT-1).
"Cloning and expression of a rat brain L-glutamate transporter.";
"Glutamate transporters from brain. A novel neurotransmitter
transporter family.";
"The rat hepatoma cell line H4-II-E-C3 expresses high activities of
the high-affinity glutamate transporter GLT-1A.";
"Histidine 326 is critical for the function of GLT-1, a (Na+ + K+)-
coupled glutamate transporter from rat brain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transports L-glutamate and also L- and D-aspartate.
    Essential for terminating the postsynaptic action of glutamate by
    rapidly removing released glutamate from the synaptic cleft. Acts
    as a symport by cotransporting sodium.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Glt1;
      IsoId=P31596-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Glt-1A;
      IsoId=P31596-2; Sequence=VSP_006266;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Localized in brain and is highly enriched in
    the Purkinje cell layer in cerebellum.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:dicarboxylate (SDF) symporter
    (TC 2.A.23) family.
