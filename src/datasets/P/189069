-!- FUNCTION: Essential component of the TIM22 complex, a complex that
    mediates the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane
    proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. The TIM22 complex
    forms a twin-pore translocase that uses the membrane potential as
    external driving force. Its precise function within the TIM22
    complex is unclear.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the TIM22 complex, whose core is composed of
    TIM18, TIM22 and TIM54, associated with the peripheral proteins
    MRS5/TIM12 and the 70 kDa heterohexamer composed of TIM9 and TIM10
    (or TIM8 and TIM13).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    single-pass membrane protein. Note=Import into inner membrane
    protein requires TOM70 function.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TIM54 family.
