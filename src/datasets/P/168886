-!- FUNCTION: Electrogenic sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter with a
    Na(+):HCO3(-) stoichiometry varying from 1:2 to 1:3. May regulate
    bicarbonate influx/efflux at the basolateral membrane of cells and
    regulate intracellular pH.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by stilbene derivatives and regulated
    by cyclic AMP.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with CA2/carbonic anhydrase 2 and CA4/carbonic
    anhydrase 4 which may regulate transporter activity (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; basolateral cell membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.

      N-glycosylation;

      IsoId=Q9JI66-3; Sequence=VSP_016719;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Specifically expressed in kidney and to a
    lower extent in liver, lung, spleen, brain, skeletal muscle and
    heart. In kidney, expressed in proximal tubules at the
    corticomedullary junction. Isoform 2 is specifically expressed in
    kidney. Isoform 1 is expressed in kidney and pancreas while
    isoform 3 is specifically expressed in brain (at protein level).
    In brain, isoform 1 is expressed in astrocytes while isoform 3 is
    expressed in neurons (at protein level). In the eye, isoform 1 is
    expressed in cornea, conjunctiva, lens epithelium, ciliary bodies
    and retina while isoform 2 is detected only in the conjunctiva.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expression is first detected at E17 in spinal
    cord and starts in forebrain at birth. Higher expression in brain
    is detected at postnatal day 15 and persists throughout adulthood.
-!- INDUCTION: Down-regulated after cadmium-intoxication and sodium or
    bicarbonate loading (at protein level). Down-regulated by HCO3[-]
    loading.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylation of Ser-1026 by PKA increases the binding of
    CA2 and changes the Na(+):HCO3(-) stoichiometry of the transporter
    from 3:1 to 2:1 (By similarity).
-!- PTM: N-glycosylation is not necessary for the transporter basic
    functions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the anion exchanger (TC 2.A.31) family.
