-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex is the component
    of the aerobic respiratory chain of E.coli that predominates when
    cells are grown at high aeration.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Ubiquinol-8 + O(2) = Ubiquinone-8 + H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooctamer of two A chains, two B chains, two C chains
    and two D chains.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 family.
