AC   P31636;
Low affinity sodium-glucose cotransporter (Sodium/glucose
cotransporter 3) (Na(+)/glucose cotransporter 3).
"Cloning and expression of a mammalian Na+/amino acid cotransporter
with sequence similarity to Na+/glucose cotransporters.";
"SAAT1 is a low affinity Na+/glucose cotransporter and not an amino
acid transporter. A reinterpretation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium-dependent glucose transporter. Has a Na+ to
    glucose coupling ratio of 1:1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Kidney, intestine, liver, skeletal muscle and
    spleen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:solute symporter (SSF)
    (TC 2.A.21) family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) thought to be a sodium/neutral
    amino acid cotransporter (system a neutral amino acid transporter)
    responsible for the sodium-dependent intake of neutral amino acids
    such as alanine, glycine, serine, cysteine, and proline.
