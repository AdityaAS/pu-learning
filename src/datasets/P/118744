AC   P46920;
Glycine betaine transport ATP-binding protein opuAA (EC 3.6.3.32)
(Quaternary-amine-transporting ATPase).
"OpuA, an osmotically regulated binding protein-dependent transport
system for the osmoprotectant glycine betaine in Bacillus subtilis.";
"The 25 degrees-36 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome:
determination of the sequence of a 146 kb segment and identification
of 113 genes.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a multicomponent binding-protein-dependent
    transport system for glycine betaine. Probably responsible for
    energy coupling to the transport system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + quaternary amine(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + quaternary amine(In).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 CBS domains.
