Galactose/methyl galactoside import ATP-binding protein mglA
(EC 3.6.3.17).
"Genome sequence of Shigella flexneri 2a: insights into pathogenicity
through comparison with genomes of Escherichia coli K12 and O157.";
"Complete genome sequence and comparative genomics of Shigella
flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex mglABC involved in
    galactose/methyl galactoside import. Responsible for energy
    coupling to the transport system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + monosaccharide(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + monosaccharide(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (mglA), two transmembrane proteins (mglC) and a solute-binding
    protein (mglB) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
    Galactose/methyl galactoside importer (TC 3.A.1.2.3) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
