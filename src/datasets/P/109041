Na(+)/H(+) antiporter 2.
"Characterization of a second gene (ZSOD22) of Na+/H+ antiporter from
salt-tolerant yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and functional expression
of ZSOD2 and ZSOD22 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium export from cell, takes up external protons in
    exchange for internal sodium ions. Seems to be poorly expressed.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fungal Na(+)/H(+) exchanger family.
