Multiple sugar-binding transport ATP-binding protein msmK.
"A binding protein-dependent transport system in Streptococcus mutans
responsible for multiple sugar metabolism.";
"Genome sequence of Streptococcus mutans UA159, a cariogenic dental
pathogen.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a binding protein-dependent transport system
    responsible for the uptake of melibiose, raffinose and
    isomaltotriose. Probably responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
