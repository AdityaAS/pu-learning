AC   P31661;
Sodium- and chloride-dependent creatine transporter 1 (CT1) (Creatine
transporter 1) (Solute carrier family 6 member 8).
"A Na(+)-dependent creatine transporter in rabbit brain, muscle,
heart, and kidney. cDNA cloning and functional expression.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the uptake of creatine. Plays an important
    role in supplying creatine to the brain via the blood-brain
    barrier (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Prominent in kidney, heart, and muscle, also
    present in brain, but not in liver and intestine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
