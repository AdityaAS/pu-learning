E3 SUMO-protein ligase PIAS3 (Protein inhibitor of activated STAT
protein 3) (Potassium channel-associated protein) (KChAP).
"Cloning and expression of a novel K+ channel regulatory protein,
KChAP.";
"A new role for the STAT3 inhibitor, PIAS3: a repressor of
microphthalmia transcription factor.";
"The intranuclear prolactin/cyclophilin B complex as a transcriptional
inducer.";
-!- FUNCTION: Functions as an E3-type small ubiquitin-like modifier
    (SUMO) ligase, stabilizing the interaction between UBE2I and the
    substrate, and as a SUMO-tethering factor. Plays a crucial role as
    a transcriptional coregulation in various cellular pathways,
    including the STAT pathway and the steroid hormone signaling
    pathway. The effects of this transcriptional coregulation,
    transactivation or silencing, may vary depending upon the
    biological context.
-!- PATHWAY: SUMO conjugation; third step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds SUMO1 and UBE2I. Interacts with AR, GFI1, HMGA2,
    IRF1, MITF, NCOA2, as well as with STAT3, after treatment with
    IL6, CNTF or OSM and with STAT5, after PRL stimulation (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nuclear speckle (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed, with highest levels in lung,
    kidney and spleen.
-!- DOMAIN: The LXXLL motif is a transcriptional coregulator
    signature.
-!- PTM: Sumoylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PIAS family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SAP domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SP-RING-type zinc finger.
-!- CAUTION: Has been shown to interact with voltage-gated potassium
    channels, including the KCNB1 subunit, and to be critical for
    current enhancement. However, in view of its mostly nuclear
    subcellular location and its established function as a
    transcriptional coregulator, promoting the sumoylation of several
    transcription factors, the effect on potassium channels awaits
    further experimental confirmation.
