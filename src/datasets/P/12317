-!- FUNCTION: This magnesium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis
    of ATP coupled with the transport of calcium out of the cell.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Ca(2+)(Cis) = ADP + phosphate +
    Ca(2+)(Trans).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=8;
      Comment=There is a combination of two alternatively spliced
      domains at N-terminal site A (X and Z) and at C-terminal site
      B/C (A, B, D and K). The splice sites have mostly been studied
      independently. Full isoforms so far detected are isoform XA and
      isoform XB. Experimental confirmation may be lacking for some
      isoforms;

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Isoform XB is the most abundant isoform and is
    expressed ubiquitously. Isoforms containing segment Z have only
    been detected in heart, while isoforms containing segment a have
    been found in heart, stomach and brain cortex.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IIB subfamily.
