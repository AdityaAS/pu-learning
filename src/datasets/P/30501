-!- FUNCTION: This protein is one of the nuclear-coded polypeptide
    chains of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal oxidase in
    mitochondrial electron transport. This protein may be one of the
    heme-binding subunits of the oxidase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Cytochrome c oxidase is composed of 11 subunits: one copy
    each of COX1, COX2, COX3, COX4, COX5A or COX5B, COX6, COX7, COX9,
    COX12, COX13 and two copies of COX8.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1390 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase VIb family.
