AC   P58905;
Ammonium transporter 1 member 1 (LeAMT1;1).
"Preferential expression of an ammonium transporter and of two
putative nitrate transporters in root hairs of tomato.";
"Differential regulation of three functional ammonium transporter
genes by nitrogen in root hairs and by light in leaves of tomato.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in high affinity ammonium uptake.

    (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Root hairs and leaves.
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrogen deficiency.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ammonium transporter (TC 2.A.49)
    family.
