AC   P06624;
Lens fiber major intrinsic protein (Aquaporin-0) (MIP26) (MP26).
"The major intrinsic protein (MIP) of the bovine lens fiber membrane:
characterization and structure based on cDNA cloning.";
"Sequence analysis of peptide fragments from the intrinsic membrane
protein of calf lens fibers MP26 and its natural maturation product
MP22.";
"Amino acid sequence of in vivo phosphorylation sites in the main
intrinsic protein (MIP) of lens membranes.";
"Complete map and identification of the phosphorylation site of bovine
lens major intrinsic protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Water channel. May be responsible for regulating the
    osmolarity of the lens.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Major component of lens fiber gap junctions.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Higher expression in pre-natal (1-5 months
    gestation) than in post-natal (4-6 months) calf lens.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
