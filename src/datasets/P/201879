Vacuolar calcium ion transporter (Vacuolar Ca(2+)/H(+) exchanger)
(High copy number undoes manganese protein 1) (Manganese resistance 1
protein).
"The product of HUM1, a novel yeast gene, is required for vacuolar
Ca2+/H+ exchange and is related to mammalian Na+/Ca2+ exchangers.";

-!- FUNCTION: Has a role in promoting intracellular calcium ion
    sequestration via the exchange of calcium ions for hydrogen ions
    across the vacuolar membrane. Involved also in manganese ion
    homeostasis via its uptake into the vacuole.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 7770 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger
    family.
