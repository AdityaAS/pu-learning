Tylosin resistance ATP-binding protein tlrC.
"Homology between proteins controlling Streptomyces fradiae tylosin
resistance and ATP-binding transport.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for tylosin resistance, and is proposed to
    be a subunit of a multicomponent export system for the energy-
    dependent efflux of tylosin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
Antibiotic resistance; ATP-binding; Membrane; Nucleotide-binding;
Repeat; Transport.
