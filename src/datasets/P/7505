-!- FUNCTION: May associate with CD21. May regulate the release of
    Ca(2+) from intracellular stores.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Note=Stress fibers (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By EBV.
-!- DOMAIN: A pair of annexin repeats may form one binding site for
    calcium and phospholipid.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated in response to growth factor stimulation.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Seems to bind one calcium ion with high affinity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the annexin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 8 annexin repeats.
