Proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1 (Proton/amino acid transporter
1) (Solute carrier family 36 member 1).
"Functional characterization of two novel mammalian electrogenic
proton-dependent amino acid cotransporters.";
"Organization and expression of the SLC36 cluster of amino acid
transporter genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Neutral amino acid/proton symporter. Has a pH-dependent
    electrogenic transport activity for small amino acids such as
    glycine, alanine and proline. Besides small apolar L-amino acids,
    it also recognize their D-enantiomers and selected amino acid
    derivatives such as gamma-aminobutyric acid.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity). Lysosome; lysosomal membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in small intestine, colon,
    kidney and brain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid/polyamine transporter 2
    family.
