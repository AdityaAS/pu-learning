Feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor-related protein 1 (Feline
leukemia virus subgroup C receptor) (hFLVCR).
"A putative cell surface receptor for anemia-inducing feline leukemia
virus subgroup C is a member of a transporter superfamily.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Complete sequencing and characterization of 21,243 full-length human
cDNAs.";
"Genomic structure and evolutionary context of the human feline
leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (hFLVCR) gene: evidence for block
duplications and de novo gene formation within duplicons of the hFLVCR
locus.";
"Identification of a human heme exporter that is essential for
erythropoiesis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Exports cytoplasmic heme. May be required to protect
    developing erythroid cells from heme toxicity. Causes
    susceptibility to FeLV-C in vitro.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found all hematopoietic tissues including
    peripheral blood lymphocytes. Some expression is found in pancreas
    and kidney.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Down-regulated in haemopoietic progenitor
    cells undergoing differentiation and hemoglobinization. Abundant
    in fetal liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Feline
    leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (TC 2.A.1.28.1) family.
