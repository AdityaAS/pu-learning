-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity gluconate transporter with fairly broad
    specificity, including low affinity for glucuronate, several
    disaccharides, and some hexoses, but not glucose.
-!- PATHWAY: Gluconate utilization.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gntP permease family.
