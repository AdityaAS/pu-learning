-!- FUNCTION: Acts as component of the Sec62/63 complex which is
    involved in SRP-independent posttranslational translocation across
    the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions together with the
    Sec61 complex and KAR2 in a channel-forming translocon complex. A
    cycle of assembly and disassembly of Sec62/63 complex from SEC61
    may govern the activity of the translocon. SEC63 may affect SEC1-
    polypeptide interactions by increasing the affinity of targeting
    pathways for SEC61 and/or by modifying SEC61 to allow more
    efficient polypeptide interaction. May also be involved in SRP-
    dependent cotranslational translocation. Is essential for cell
    growth and for germination.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the heterotetrameric Sec62/63complex
    composed of SEC62, SEC63, SEC66 and SEC72. The Sec62/63 complex
    associates with the Sec61 complex to form the Sec complex. SEC63
    interacts in its phosphorylated form with SEC62. May physically
    associate with KAR2 in the endoplasmic reticulum and this
    interaction may be regulated by ATP hydrolysis. Part of a complex
    consisting of KAR2, SEC63, SEC66 and SEC72.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Nucleus; nuclear envelope;
    multi-pass membrane protein. Nucleus; nuclear inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- PTM: Phosphotylated by casein kinase II.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 17700 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 J domain.
