AC   P11990;
Pneumolysin (Thiol-activated cytolysin).
"Molecular cloning, characterization, and complete nucleotide sequence
of the gene for pneumolysin, the sulfhydryl-activated toxin of
Streptococcus pneumoniae.";
"Complete genome sequence of a virulent isolate of Streptococcus
pneumoniae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sulfhydryl-activated toxin. Is able to lyse cholesterol
    containing membranes. Can be reversibly inactivated by oxidation.
    Cholesterol is the receptor for the binding of these toxins to
    eukaryotic cell membranes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the thiol-activated cytolysin family.
