-!- FUNCTION: This is a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter. It can mediate sodium
    uptake when a transmembrane pH gradient is applied. It probably
    acts in the regulation of internal pH at the alkaline pH range. It
    catalyzes the exchange of 2 H(+) per Na(+). Its activity is highly
    dependent on the pH.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Transcription stimulated by high Na(+) concentrations.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nhaA Na(+)/H(+) antiporter family.
