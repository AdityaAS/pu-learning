Colicin-A.
"Complete nucleotide sequence of the structural gene for colicin A, a
gene translated at non-uniform rate.";
"The complete nucleotide sequence of the colicinogenic plasmid ColA.
High extent of homology with ColE1.";
"Nucleotide sequence of promoter, operator and amino-terminal region
of caa, the structural gene of colicin A.";
-!- FUNCTION: This colicin is a channel-forming colicin. This class of
    transmembrane toxins depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane, leading
    to dissipation of cellular energy.
-!- FUNCTION: Colicins are polypeptide toxins produced by and active
    against, Escherichia coli and closely related bacteria.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the channel forming colicin family.
