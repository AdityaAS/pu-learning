-!- FUNCTION: Functional component of endoplasmic reticulum-associated
    degradation (ERAD) for misfolded lumenal proteins. May act by
    forming a channel that allows the retrotranslocation of misfolded
    proteins into the cytosol where they are ubiquitinated and
    degraded by the proteasome. May mediate the interaction between
    VCP and the degradation substrate. In case of infection by
    cytomegaloviruses, it plays a central role in the export from the
    ER and subsequent degradation of MHC class I heavy chains via its
    interaction with US11 viral protein, which recognizes and
    associates with MHC class I heavy chains. Also participates in the
    degradation process of misfolded cytomegalovirus US2 protein.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms homo- and heterooligomers with DERL2 and DERL3;
    binding to DERL3 is poorer than that between DERL2 and DERL3.
    Interacts with AMFR, SELS/VIMP, SEL1L, SYVN1 and VCP, as well as
    with SEL1L-SYVN1 and VCP-SELS protein complexes; this interaction
    is weaker than that observed between DERL2 and these complexes.
    Interacts with the cytomegalovirus US11 protein. Interacts with
    NGLY1. Does not bind to EDEM1.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P13569:CFTR; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-398977, EBI-349854;
    P09727:US11 (xeno); NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-398977, EBI-399060;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous.
-!- INDUCTION: Up-regulated in response to ER stress via the ERN1-XBP1
    pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the derlin family.
