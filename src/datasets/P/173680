AC   Q9JHI3;
Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2B1 (Solute
carrier family 21 member 9) (Organic anion transporter moatp1).
"Molecular identification of a rat novel organic anion transporter
moat1, which transports prostaglandin D(2), leukotriene C(4), and
taurocholate.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the Na(+)-independent transport of organic
    anions such as taurocholate, the prostaglandins PGD2, PGE1, PGE2,
    leukotriene C4, thromboxane B2 and iloprost.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the organo anion transporter (TC 2.A.60)
    family.
