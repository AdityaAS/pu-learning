"Sequence analysis of the vir-region from Agrobacterium tumefaciens
octopine Ti plasmid pTi15955.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in DNA transformation; mediates the nuclear
    uptake of single-stranded DNA copies of the transferred DNA (T-
    DNA) element. Binds single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA
    regardless of nucleotide sequence composition (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Host nucleus (By similarity).
