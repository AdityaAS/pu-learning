AC   P23936;
Lactose permease (Lactose-proton symporter) (Lactose transport
protein) [Includes: Putative phosphotransferase enzyme IIA component
(EC 2.7.1.-) (Putative PTS system EIIA component)].
"Lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus: a hybrid
protein with homology to the melibiose carrier and enzyme III of
phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems.";
"Carbohydrate utilization in Streptococcus thermophilus:
characterization of the genes for aldose 1-epimerase (mutarotase) and
UDPglucose 4-epimerase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for transport of beta-galactosides into the
    cell, with the concomitant uptake of protons (symport system), and
    also for transport of homologous and heterologous exchange of
    beta-galactosides.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The PTS EIIA type-1 domain may serve a regulatory
    function, through its phosphorylation activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the
    sodium:galactoside symporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIA type-1 domain.
