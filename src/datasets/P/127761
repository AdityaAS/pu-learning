AC   P56513;
Phospholemman precursor (FXYD domain-containing ion transport
regulator 1).
"Purification and complete sequence determination of the major plasma
membrane substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein
kinase C in myocardium.";
-!- FUNCTION: Induces a hyperpolarization-activated chloride current
    when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. May have a functional role in
    muscle contraction.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Present in heart, esophagus, stomach, aorta,
    skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and liver but absent from brain
    and kidney.
-!- PTM: Major plasma membrane substrate for cAMP-dependent protein
    kinase (PK-A) and protein kinase C (PK-C) in several different
    tissues. Phosphorylated in response to insulin and adrenergic
    stimulation (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FXYD family.
