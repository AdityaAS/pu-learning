-!- FUNCTION: Acts as non-essential component of the Sec62/63 complex
    which is involved in SRP-independent posttranslational
    translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions
    together with the Sec61 complex and KAR2 in a channel-forming
    translocon complex. A cycle of assembly and disassembly of
    Sec62/63 complex from SEC61 may govern the activity of the
    translocon. SEC72 may be involved in signal peptide recognition
    for a defined subset of leader peptides, or may increase the
    efficiency of unusual or "difficult" secretory precursors to the
    translocation pore, it may be that this protein binds charged
    leader peptides to the membrane until they engage the
    translocation apparatus.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the heterotetrameric Sec62/63complex
    composed of SEC62, SEC63, SEC71 and SEC72. The Sec62/63 complex
    associates with the Sec61 complex to form the Sec complex. May
    interact with protein YLR301W. Part of a complex consisting of
    KAR2, SEC63, SEC66 and SEC72.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 5290 molecules/cell.
