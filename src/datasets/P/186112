AC   P23054;
Tetracycline resistance protein.
"Nucleotide sequence homology of the tetracycline-resistance
determinant naturally maintained in Bacillus subtilis Marburg 168
chromosome and the tetracycline-resistance gene of B. subtilis plasmid
pNS1981.";
"Systematic sequencing of the 180 kilobase region of the Bacillus
subtilis chromosome containing the replication origin.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Resistance to tetracycline by an active tetracycline
    efflux. This is an energy-dependent process that decreases the
    accumulation of the antibiotic in whole cells. This protein
    functions as a metal-tetracycline/H(+) antiporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. TCR/tet
    family.
