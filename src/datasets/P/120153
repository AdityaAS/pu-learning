-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for ATP that acts as a ligand gated ion
    channel. Responsible for ATP-dependent lysis of macrophages
    through the formation of membrane pores permeable to large
    molecules. Could function in both fast synaptic transmission and
    the ATP-mediated lysis of antigen-presenting cells.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms homo- or heteropolymers. Interacts with LAMA3,
    ITGB2, ACTB, ACTN4, SVIL, MPP3, HSPA1, HSPCB, HSPA8, PIK230 and
    PTPRB.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylation results in its inactivation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the P2X receptor family.
