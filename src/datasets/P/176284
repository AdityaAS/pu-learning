AC   P08375;
Sarcotoxin-1A precursor (Sarcotoxin IA).
"Molecular cloning of a cDNA and assignment of the C-terminal of
sarcotoxin IA, a potent antibacterial protein of Sarcophaga
peregrina.";
"Primary structure of sarcotoxin I, an antibacterial protein induced
in the hemolymph of Sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly) larvae.";
"Solution conformation of an antibacterial peptide, sarcotoxin IA, as
determined by 1H-NMR.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sarcotoxins, which are potent bactericidal proteins, are
    produced in response to injury. They are cytotoxic to both Gram-
    positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cecropin family.
