-!- FUNCTION: Calcium-dependent mitochondrial aspartate and glutamate
    carrier. May have a function in the urea cycle.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: High levels in liver and low levels in kidney,
    pancreas, placenta, heart and brain.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC25A13 are the cause of adult-onset type-II
    citrullinemia (AO-CTLN2) [MIM:603471]. CTLN2 is characterized
    primarily by elevated serum and urine citrulline levels. A few
    years after onset patients enter a coma and suffer cerebral edema.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC25A13 are the cause of neonatal-onset type-
    II citrullinemia (NO-CTLN2) [MIM:605814]; also known as neonatal
    intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD).
    CTLN2 is characterized primarily by elevated serum and urine
    citrulline levels. A few years after onset patients enter a coma
    and suffer cerebral edema.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Binds calcium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 EF-hand domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
