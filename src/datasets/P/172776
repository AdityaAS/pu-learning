-!- FUNCTION: Potassium channel activated by both membrane
    depolarization or increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) that mediates
    export of K(+). Its activation dampens the excitatory events that
    elevate the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and/or depolarize the
    cell membrane. It therefore contributes to repolarization of the
    membrane potential. Kinetics are determined by alternative
    splicing, phosphorylation status and its combination interaction
    with Slob and 14-3-3-zeta. While the interaction with Slob1 alone
    increases its activity, its interaction with both Slob1 and 14-3-
    3-zeta decreases its activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer; which constitutes the calcium-activated
    potassium channel (By similarity). Interacts with Slip1. Interacts
    with Slob, and, indirectly with 14-3-3-zeta via its interaction
    with Slob. Interacts with Pka-C1 and Src kinases, which can bind
    simultaneously to it.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in muscle cells, neurons of the CNS
    and PNS, mushroom bodies, a limited number of cells in embryonic
    and larval midgut and in epithelial-derived tracheal cells. During
    pupariation and embryogenesis, it is expressed in muscles many
    hours prior to the appearance of functional channels.
-!- DOMAIN: The S4 segment, which is characterized by a series of
    positively charged amino acids at every third position, is part of
    the voltage-sensor (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The pore-forming domain (also referred as P region) is
    imbedded into the membrane, and forms the selectivity filter of
    the pore. It contains the signature sequence of potassium channels
    that displays selectivity to potassium (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The RCK N-terminal domain mediates the
    homotetramerization, thereby promoting the assembly of monomers
    into functional potassium channel. It includes binding sites for
    Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The calcium bowl constitutes one of the Ca(2+) sensors and
    probably acts as a Ca(2+)-binding site.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated. Phosphorylation may be mediated by both PKA
    and SRC kinases, which activate the channel activity.
    Phosphorylation by PKA is however unclear. Indeed, although
    modulation of channel activity requires Pka-C1, it does not
    interacts with the whole PKA holoenzyme. Moreover, modulation of
    activity does not depend upon phosphorylation of Ser-978.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family. Calcium-
    activated subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RCK N-terminal domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.5 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 192.
