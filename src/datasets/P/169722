AC   Q761V0; Q8CFM5; Q91ZQ2;
Sodium- and chloride-dependent glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2) (GlyT-2)
(Solute carrier family 6 member 5).
"Gene structure and alternative splicing of the mouse glycine
transporter type-2.";
"Cloning and expression of mouse sodium-dependent glycine transporter
2 (Glyt2).";
-!- FUNCTION: Terminates the action of glycine by its high affinity
    sodium-dependent reuptake into presynaptic terminals. May be
    responsible for the termination of neurotransmission at
    strychnine-sensitive glycinergic synapses (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By
    similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=a;
      IsoId=Q761V0-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=b;
      IsoId=Q761V0-2; Sequence=VSP_051603;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Isoform a and isoform b are expressed at high
    levels in brain stem and spinal cord. Isoform a is also expressed
    in the cerebellum.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
