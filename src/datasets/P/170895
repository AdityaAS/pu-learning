subunit) (P12).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export. Participates in an early
    event of protein translocation (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secG family.
