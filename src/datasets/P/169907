AC   P08104;
Sodium channel protein type 3 subunit alpha (Sodium channel protein
type III subunit alpha) (Voltage-gated sodium channel subunit alpha
Nav1.3) (Sodium channel protein, brain III subunit alpha) (Voltage-
gated sodium channel subtype III).
"Primary structure of rat brain sodium channel III deduced from the
cDNA sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the voltage-dependent sodium ion permeability
    of excitable membranes. Assuming opened or closed conformations in
    response to the voltage difference across the membrane, the
    protein forms a sodium-selective channel through which Na(+) ions
    may pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient.
-!- SUBUNIT: The sodium channel consists of a large polypeptide and 2-
    3 smaller ones. This sequence represents a large polypeptide.
    Interacts with NEDD4L (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The sequence contains 4 internal repeats, each with 5
    hydrophobic segments (S1,S2,S3,S5,S6) and one positively charged
    segment (S4). Segments S4 are probably the voltage-sensors and are
    characterized by a series of positively charged amino acids at
    every third position.
-!- PTM: May be ubiquitinated by NEDD4L; which would promote its
    endocytosis (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium channel family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 IQ domain.
