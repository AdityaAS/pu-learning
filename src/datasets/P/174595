Stage V sporulation protein E.
"Revised nucleotide sequence of the sporulation gene spoVE from
Bacillus subtilis.";
"Nucleotide sequence of the Bacillus subtilis developmental gene
spoVE.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"DNA sequence of the murE-murD region of Bacillus subtilis 168.";
"A Bacillus subtilis morphogene cluster that includes spoVE is
homologous to the mra region of Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play an essential role not only during sporulation,
    but also during vegetative growth.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ftsW/rodA/spoVE family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (AAA22807) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 86.
