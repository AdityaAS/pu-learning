Iron(III)-transport system permease protein fbpB 2.
"Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae
Rd.";
"Identification of a locus involved in the utilization of iron by
Haemophilus influenzae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex fbpABC
    (TC 3.A.1.10.1) involved in Fe(3+) ions import. Probably
    responsible for the translocation of the substrate across the
    membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (fbpC), two transmembrane proteins (fbpB) and a solute-binding
    protein (fbpA) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. FbpB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transmembrane type-1 domains.
