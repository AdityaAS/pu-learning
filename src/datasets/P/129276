Outer membrane porin protein LC precursor.
"Structure of the lc and nmpC outer membrane porin protein genes of
lambdoid bacteriophage.";
-!- FUNCTION: Porins are major proteins found in the outer membranes
    of Gram-negative bacteria where they form channels for the
    nonspecific permeation of small solutes (molecules with MW lower
    than 4 to 6 kDa).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: A porin gene can also be found in the genomes of
    certain lambdoid bacteriophage, and its protein is expressed in
    the lysogenic state. In E.coli the expression of ompC and ompF
    proteins is then reduced substantially.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Gram-negative porin family.
