AC   P0AEX8; P08340;
High-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport system permease
protein livH (LIV-I protein H).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for branched-chain amino acids. Probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrates across the membrane (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. LivHM subfamily.
