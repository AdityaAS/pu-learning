AC   Q3J1A5; P02954; Q9RFB9;
Reaction center protein L chain (Photosynthetic reaction center L
subunit).
"DNA sequence analysis of the photosynthesis region of Rhodobacter
sphaeroides 2.4.1.";
"Complete sequence of chromosome 1 of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1.";
-!- FUNCTION: The reaction center is a membrane-bound complex that
    mediates the initial photochemical event in the electron transfer
    process of photosynthesis (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Reaction center is composed of four bacteriochlorophylls,
    two bacteriopheophytins, two ubiquinones, one iron, and three
    highly hydrophobic polypeptide chains (designated L, M, and H) (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the reaction center pufL/M/psbA/D family.
