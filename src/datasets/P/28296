Nickel and cobalt resistance protein cnrB precursor.
"Characterization of the inducible nickel and cobalt resistance
determinant cnr from pMOL28 of Alcaligenes eutrophus CH34.";
"Sequence and features of the Ralstonia metallidurans CH34 heavy metal
plasmids pMOL28 and pMOL30.";
"Complete sequence of plasmid pMOL28 of Ralstonia metallidurans
CH34.";
"Regulation of the cnr cobalt and nickel resistance determinant from
Ralstonia sp. strain CH34.";
-!- FUNCTION: The products of the genes cnrA, cnrB, and cnrC are
    likely to form a membrane-bound protein complex catalyzing an
    energy-dependent efflux of Ni(2+) and Co(2+). The mechanism of
    action of the cnrCBA complex may be that of a proton/cation
    antiporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: By nickel.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the membrane fusion protein (MFP)
    (TC 8.A.1) family.
