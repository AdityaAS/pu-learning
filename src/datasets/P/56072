Molybdenum-containing formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase 1 subunit C
(EC 1.2.99.5) (Molybdenum-containing formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase
I subunit C).
"A polyferredoxin with eight [4Fe-4S] clusters as a subunit of
molybdenum formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase from Methanosarcina
barkeri.";
"The Methanosarcina barkeri genome: comparative analysis with
Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanosarcina mazei reveals extensive
rearrangement within methanosarcinal genomes.";
"Formylmethanofuran dehydrogenases from methanogenic Archaea.
Substrate specificity, EPR properties and reversible inactivation by
cyanide of the molybdenum or tungsten iron-sulfur proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reversible oxidation of CO(2) and
    methanofuran (MFR) to N-formylmethanofuran (CHO-MFR). Can use N-
    furfurylformamide, formamide, N-methylformamide, and formate as
    substrates. This enzyme is oxygen-labile.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Formylmethanofuran + H(2)O + acceptor = CO(2)
    + methanofuran + reduced acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Molybdenum.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inactivated by cyanide.
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis; first step.
-!- SUBUNIT: This enzyme is composed of six subunits; fmdA (65 kDa),
    fmdB (50 kDa), fmdC (34 kDa), fmdD (17 kDa), fmdE (23 kDa) and
    fmdF (37 kDa).
-!- INDUCTION: By growth on molybdenum, under anaerobic conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fwdC/fmdC family.
