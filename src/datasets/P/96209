AC   P94633;
Lysine exporter protein.
"A new type of transporter with a new type of cellular function: L-
lysine export from Corynebacterium glutamicum.";
"Complete genomic sequence of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032.";
"The complete Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 genome sequence
and its impact on the production of L-aspartate-derived amino acids
and vitamins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the efflux of excess of L-lysine. This is
    necessary to control the intracellular L-lysine level.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lysE/argO transporter (TC 2.A.75)
    family.
