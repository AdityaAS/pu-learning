-!- FUNCTION: The plasma membrane ATPase of plants and fungi is a
    hydrogen ion pump. The proton gradient it generates drives the
    active transport of nutrients by H(+)-symport. The resulting
    external acidification and/or internal alkinization may mediate
    growth responses.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IIIA subfamily.
