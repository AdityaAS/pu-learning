AC   Q9BQT8;
Mitochondrial 2-oxodicarboxylate carrier (Solute carrier family 25
member 21).
"Identification of the human mitochondrial oxodicarboxylate carrier.
Bacterial expression, reconstitution, functional characterization,
tissue distribution and chromosomal location.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transports C5-C7 oxodicarboxylates across the inner
    membranes of mitochondria. Can transport 2-oxoadipate, 2-
    oxoglutarate, adipate, glutarate, and to a lesser extent,
    pimelate, 2-oxopimelate, 2-aminoadipate, oxaloacetate, and
    citrate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
