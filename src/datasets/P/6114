-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    alsBAC for D-allose; probably responsible for the translocation of
    the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. AraH/rbsC subfamily.
