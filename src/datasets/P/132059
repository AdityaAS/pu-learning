-!- FUNCTION: Proton symporter that senses osmotic shifts and responds
    by importing osmolytes such as proline, glycine betaine,
    stachydrine, pipecolic acid, ectoine and taurine. It is both an
    osmosensor and an osmoregulator which is available to participate
    early in the bacterial osmoregulatory response.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
