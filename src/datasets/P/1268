AC   Q52815; Q1MH74;
General L-amino acid transport ATP-binding protein aapP.
"The general L-amino acid permease of Rhizobium leguminosarum is an
ABC uptake system that also influences efflux of solutes.";
"The genome of Rhizobium leguminosarum has recognizable core and
accessory components.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a binding-protein-dependent transport system for
    L-amino acids, affects the uptake as well as the efflux of these
    amino acids. Probably responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
