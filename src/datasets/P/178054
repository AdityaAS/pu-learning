-!- FUNCTION: Quaternary ammonium compound efflux pump. Confers
    resistance to cetylpyridinium, cetyldimethylethyl ammonium and
    cetrimide cations.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Unlike the other members of the SMR family, sugE
    exhibits a narrow specificity for a very specific class of
    compounds.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small multidrug resistance (SMR)
    protein family. SugE (TC 2.A.7.1.4) subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) thought to suppress a groEL
    mutation and mimic the effect of groE overexpression. This was
    later shown (Ref.6) to be probably due to an artifact.
