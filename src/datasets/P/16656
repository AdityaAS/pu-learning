"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity uptake of choline driven by a proton-
    motive force (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amine and polyamine biosynthesis; betaine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By osmotic stress. Choline is required for full
    expression (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the BCCT transporter (TC 2.A.15) family.
