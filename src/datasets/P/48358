AC   P77257; P76879;
Putative ABC transporter ATP-binding protein ego (EGO10A).
"A 570-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 28.0-40.1 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably part of a binding-protein-dependent transport
    system ego/ydeYZ. Probably responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system. This protein is essential for aerobic growth.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0A6F5:groL; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1124301, EBI-543750;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MglA subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
