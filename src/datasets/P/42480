-!- FUNCTION: Terminal reductase during anaerobic growth on various
    sulfoxide and N-oxide compounds. Allows E.coli to grow
    anaerobically on Me(2)SO as respiratory oxidant.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Reduces various N-oxide and sulfoxide
    compounds including trimethylamine N-oxide.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster (Potential).
-!- COFACTOR: Molybdenum (molybdopterin).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic heterodimer
    (DmsAB) and a membrane anchor protein (DmsC).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein;
    cytoplasmic side.
-!- PTM: Exported by the Tat system. The position of the signal
    peptide cleavage has been experimentally proven.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The Tat signal sequence is essential for the
    expression of dmsA, the stability of the dmsAB dimer and membrane
    targeting. Despite the presence of a signal sequence, dmsA is not
    exported to the periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family.
