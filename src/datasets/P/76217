Pyrophosphate-energized proton pump (EC 3.6.1.1) (Pyrophosphate-
energized inorganic pyrophosphatase) (H+-PPase) (Membrane-bound
proton-translocating pyrophosphatase).
"A thermostable vacuolar-type membrane pyrophosphatase from the
archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum: implications for the origins of
pyrophosphate-energized pumps.";
"Genome sequence of the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum
aerophilum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Generates a proton motive force; it probably catalyzes a
    fully reversible reaction, thus being able to synthesize
    pyrophosphate when the proton motive force is sufficient.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Diphosphate + H(2)O = 2 phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Temperature dependence:
      Optimum temperature is 80 degrees Celsius;
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase
    (TC 3.A.10) family. Type 2 subfamily.
