AC   P40727; Q6LDV3;
Flagellar biosynthetic protein flhB.
"Molecular characterization of the Salmonella typhimurium flhB operon
and its protein products.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Purification and characterization of the CheZ protein of bacterial
chemotaxis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for formation of the rod structure in the basal
    body of the flagellar apparatus. Together with fliI and fliH, may
    constitute the export apparatus of flagellin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the flhB/hrpN/yscU/spaS family.
