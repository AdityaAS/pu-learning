AC   Q12675;
Probable phospholipid-transporting ATPase DNF2 (EC 3.6.3.1).
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IV.";
"An essential subfamily of Drs2p-related P-type ATPases is required
for protein trafficking between Golgi complex and endosomal/vacuolar
system.";
"Quantitative phosphoproteomics applied to the yeast pheromone
signaling pathway.";
"A global topology map of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: This magnesium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis
    of ATP coupled with the transport of phospholipids. Required for
    protein transport from Golgi to vacuoles.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O = ADP + phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IV subfamily.
