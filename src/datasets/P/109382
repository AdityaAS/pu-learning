Respiratory nitrate reductase 2 alpha chain (EC 1.7.99.4).
"Nitrate reductases of Escherichia coli: sequence of the second
nitrate reductase and comparison with that encoded by the narGHJI
operon.";
"A 570-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 28.0-40.1 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a second nitrate reductase enzyme which can
    substitute for the NRA enzyme and allows E.coli to use nitrate as
    an electron acceptor during anaerobic growth.
-!- FUNCTION: The alpha chain is the actual site of nitrate reduction.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nitrite + acceptor = nitrate + reduced
    acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 molybdenum ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) groups
    per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer composed of an alpha, a beta and 2 gamma chains.
    Alpha and beta are catalytic chains; gamma chain is involved in
    binding the enzyme complex to the cytoplasmic membrane.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P11349:narH; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-547262, EBI-555067;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family.
