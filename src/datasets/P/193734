Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2
(TrpV2) (osm-9-like TRP channel 2) (OTRPC2) (Vanilloid receptor-like
protein 1) (VRL-1).
"A capsaicin-receptor homologue with a high threshold for noxious
heat.";
"Cloning and functional expression of VRL, a vanilloid receptor-like
gene.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Calcium-permeable, non-selective cation channel with an
    outward rectification. Seems to be regulated, at least in part, by
    IGF-I, PDGF and neuropeptide head activator. May transduce
    physical stimuli in mast cells. Activated by temperatures higher
    than 52 degrees Celsius; is not activated by vanilloids and acidic
    pH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (Probable). Interacts with a cAMP-dependent
    protein kinase type II regulatory subunit (PRKAR2A or PRKAR2B) and
    ACBD3. Interacts with RGA (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity). Cytoplasm (By similarity). Note=Translocates from
    the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane upon ligand stimulation (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by PKA (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. TrpV
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 ANK repeats.
