Peroxisomal targeting signal 1 receptor (Peroxisome receptor 1)
(Peroxisomal C-terminal targeting signal import receptor) (PTS1-BP)
(Peroxin-5) (PTS1 receptor) (PXR1P) (PTS1R).
"A mouse model for Zellweger syndrome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to the C-terminal PTS1-type tripeptide peroxisomal
    targeting signal (SKL-type) and plays an essential role in
    peroxisomal protein import.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q60680-1:Chuk; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-646301, EBI-646260;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Peroxisome; peroxisomal membrane;
    peripheral membrane protein. Note=Its distribution appears to be
    dynamic. It is probably a cycling receptor found mainly in the
    cytoplasm and as well associated to the peroxisomal membrane
    through a docking factor (PEX13).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peroxisomal targeting signal receptor
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 7 TPR repeats.
