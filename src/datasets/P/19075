AC   P20021;
Probable cadmium-transporting ATPase (EC 3.6.3.3) (Cadmium efflux
ATPase).
"Cadmium resistance from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 cadA gene
results from a cadmium-efflux ATPase.";
-!- FUNCTION: This electroneutral antiporter ejects one cadmium ion
    while accumulating two protons by an energy-dependent efflux
    mechanism.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Cd(2+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    Cd(2+)(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HMA domain.
