AC   Q9GZC8;
Systemic RNA interference defective protein 1 precursor (Systemic RNAi
enabling protein).
"Systemic RNAi in C. elegans requires the putative transmembrane
protein SID-1.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
"Transport of dsRNA into cells by the transmembrane protein SID-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required cell-autonomously for spread of dsRNA in
    systemic RNA interference (RNAi) between tissues to silence gene
    expression distant from the site of initiation. Not required to
    initiate or maintain an RNAi response or for cell-autonomous RNAi.
    Required for import of RNAi; enables passive cellular uptake of
    dsRNA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in most non-neuronal cells,
    including body wall muscle cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SID1 family.
