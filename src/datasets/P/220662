-!- FUNCTION: Collagen-binding outer membrane protein forming a
    fibrillar matrix on the bacterial cell surface. Promotes initial
    attachment and invasion of eukaryotic cells. Also protects the
    bacteria by being responsible for agglutination, serum resistance,
    complement inactivation and phagocytosis resistance.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced at 37 degrees Celsius by the temperature-
    dependent transcriptional activator lcrF (virF) (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Presents a lollipop-shaped form which consists of three
    domains: a C-terminal membrane-anchor domain, a coiled-coil stalk
    domain and an oval N-terminal head domain. The N-terminal half of
    the sequence reveals the presence of repeated motifs with the
    consensus sequence NSVAIGXXS. They form the turns and hydrophobic
    core of the nine-coiled left-handed parallel beta-roll and trimer
    structure essential for the collagen-binding activity (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the autotransporter-2 (TC 1.B.40) /
    oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin (Oca) family.
