-!- FUNCTION: Channel that permits osmotically driven movement of
    water in both directions. It is involved in the osmoregulation and
    in the maintenance of cell turgor during volume expansion in
    rapidly growing cells. It mediates rapid entry or exit of water in
    response to abrupt changes in osmolarity (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
