-!- FUNCTION: Decarboxylase subunit of the primary sodium pump
    glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase (GCD).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4-carboxybut-2-enoyl-CoA = but-2-enoyl-CoA +
    CO(2).
-!- PATHWAY: Anaerobic glutamate metabolism; fifth step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooctamer consisting of two alpha, two beta, two
    gamma and two delta subunits.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 carboxyltransferase domain.
