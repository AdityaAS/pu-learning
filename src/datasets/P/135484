AC   P26379;
Fructose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA component (EC 2.7.1.-)
(PTS system fructose-specific EIIA component) (EIIA-Fru) (p16).
"Levanase operon of Bacillus subtilis includes a fructose-specific
phosphotransferase system regulating the expression of the operon.";
"A 23911 bp region of the Bacillus subtilis genome comprising genes
located upstream and downstream of the lev operon.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in fructose transport.
-!- FUNCTION: LevD and levE act as negative regulators of the levanase
    operon. They may be involved in a PTS-mediated phosphorylation of
    a regulator.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIA N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine +
    protein EIIB = protein EIIA + protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIA domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr on a
    histidyl residue. Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the
    EIIB domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIA type-4 domain.
