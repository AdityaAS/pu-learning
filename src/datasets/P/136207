N,N'-diacetylchitobiose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA
component (EC 2.7.1.-) (PTS system N,N'-diacetylchitobiose-specific
EIIA component) (EIIA-Chb) (EIII-Chb).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in N,N'-diacetylchitobiose
    transport (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIA N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine +
    protein EIIB = protein EIIA + protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine.
-!- PATHWAY: N,N'-diacetylchitobiose utilization.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer; in both its unphosphorylated and
    phosphorylated forms (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By N,N'-diacetylchitobiose (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIA domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr on a
    histidyl residue. Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the
    EIIB domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIA type-3 domain.
