-!- FUNCTION: The nitrate reductase enzyme complex allows E.coli to
    use nitrate as an electron acceptor during anaerobic growth. The
    gamma chain is a membrane-embedded heme-iron unit resembling
    cytochrome b, which transfers electrons from quinones to the beta
    subunit.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nitrite + acceptor = nitrate + reduced
    acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 hemes per subunit.
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer of heterotrimers each composed of an alpha, a beta
    and a gamma chain. Alpha and beta are catalytic chains; gamma
    chains are involved in binding the enzyme complex to the
    cytoplasmic membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrate.
