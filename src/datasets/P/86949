-!- FUNCTION: Probably important in the regulation of neuronal
    excitability. Associates with KCNQ3 to form a potassium channel
    with essentially identical properties to the channel underlying
    the native M-current, a slowly activating and deactivating
    potassium conductance which plays a critical role in determining
    the subthreshold electrical excitability of neurons as well as the
    responsiveness to synaptic inputs. KCNQ2/KCNQ3 current is blocked
    by linopirdine and XE991, and activated by the anticonvulsant
    retigabine. Muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M strongly suppress
    KCNQ2/KCNQ3 current in cells in which cloned KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels
    were coexpressed with M1 muscarinic receptors.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heteromultimer with KCNQ3. May associate with KCNE2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: In adult and fetal brain. Highly expressed in
    areas containing neuronal cell bodies, low in spinal chord and
    corpus callosum. Isoform 2 is preferentially expressed in
    differentiated neurons, whereas isoform 6 is prominent in fetal
    brain, undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells, and brain tumors.
-!- DOMAIN: The segment S4 is probably the voltage-sensor and is
    characterized by a series of positively charged amino acids at
    every third position (By similarity).
-!- PTM: In Xenopus oocytes KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heteromeric current can be
    increased by intracellular cyclic AMP, an effect that depends on
    phosphorylation of Ser-52 in the N-terminus region.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in KCNQ2 are the cause of benign familial
    neonatal convulsions type 1 (BFNC1) [MIM:121200]; also known as
    epilepsy, benign neonatal type 1 (EBN1). BFNC1 is an autosomal
    dominant form of epilepsy in the newborn that clears spontaneously
    after a few weeks and is followed by normal psychomotor
    development.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in KCNQ2 are the cause of myokymia with neonatal
    epilepsy [MIM:606437]. Neonatal epilepsy or benign familial
    neonatal convulsions (BFNC) is a generalized, idiopathic epilepsy
    syndrome of the newborn. Neonatal epilepsy with myokymia consists
    of a syndrome in which neonatal epilepsy is followed later in life
    by myokymia, the spontaneous involuntary contractions of skeletal
    muscles fiber groups that can be observed as vermiform movement of
    the overlying skin. Electromyography typically shows continuous
    motor unit activity with spontaneous oligo- and multiplet-
    discharges of high intraburst frequency (myokymic discharges).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inclusion of isoform 6 in heteromultimers results
    in attenuation of potassium current. Prominent expression of
    isoform 6 in the developing brain may alter firing repertoires of
    immature neurons excitability to provide cues for proliferation
    rather than differentiation.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Mutagenesis experiments were carried out in Xenopus
    oocytes by coexpression of either KCNQ2(mut) and KCNQ3 at the
    ratio of 1:1, or of KCNQ2(mut), KCNQ2(wt) and KCNQ3 at the ratio
    of 1:1:2, to mimic the situation in a heterozygous patient with
    BFNC1 disease.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family. KQT
    subfamily.
