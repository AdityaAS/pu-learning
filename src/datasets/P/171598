-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the efflux of sugars. The physiological role
    may be the detoxification of non-metabolizable sugar analogs. Can
    transport IPTG, lactose and glucose. Has broad substrate
    specificity, with preferences for glucosides or galactosides with
    alkyl or aryl substituents.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Set
    transporter family.
