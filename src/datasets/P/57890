-!- FUNCTION: Involved in GDP-fucose import from the cytoplasm into
    the Golgi lumen.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC35C1 are the cause of congenital disorder
    of glycosylation type IIc (CDG-IIc) [MIM:266265]; also known as
    leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LAD II). The clinical
    features of CDG-IIc include mental retardation, short stature,
    facial stigmata, and recurrent bacterial peripheral infections
    with persistently elevated peripheral leukocytes. Biochemically,
    it is characterized by a lack of fucosylated glycoconjugates,
    including selectin ligands.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nucleotide-sugar transporter family.
    SLC35C subfamily.
