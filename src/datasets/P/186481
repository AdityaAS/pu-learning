-!- FUNCTION: Necessary for the fragmentation of Golgi stacks during
    mitosis and for their reassembly after mitosis. Involved in the
    formation of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum (tER). The
    transfer of membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi
    apparatus occurs via 50-70 nm transition vesicles which derive
    from part-rough, part-smooth transitional elements of the
    endoplasmic reticulum (tER). Vesicle budding from the tER is an
    ATP-dependent process. The ternary complex containing UFD1L, VCP
    and NPLOC4 binds ubiquitinated proteins and is necessary for the
    export of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytoplasm, where
    they are degraded by the proteasome. The NPLOC4-UFD1L-VCP complex
    regulates spindle disassembly at the end of mitosis and is
    necessary for the formation of a closed nuclear envelope (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homohexamer. Forms a ring-shaped particle of 12.5 nm
    diameter, that displays 6-fold radial symmetry. Part of a ternary
    complex containing STX5A, NSFL1C and VCP. NSFL1C forms a
    homotrimer that binds to one end of a VCP homohexamer. The complex
    binds to membranes enriched in phosphatidylethanolamine-containing
    lipids. Interaction with VCIP135 leads to dissociation of the
    complex via ATP hydrolysis by VCP. Part of a ternary complex
    containing NPLOC4, UFD1L and VCP (By similarity). Interacts with
    SELS/VIMP, as well as with DERL1, DERL2 and DERL3; which probably
    transfer misfolded proteins from the ER to VCP. Interacts with
    SVIP. Component of a complex required to couple
    retrotranslocation, ubiquitination and deglycosylation composed of
    NGLY1, SAKS1, AMFR, VCP and RAD23B (By similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q14191:WRN; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-355164, EBI-368417;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases in response to T-cell
    antigen receptor activation (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the AAA ATPase family.
