AC   Q8UZK5;
Unique short US11 glycoprotein precursor (gpUS11) (HXLF1).
"Immune evasion genes from the Towne strain of human
cytomegalovirus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Redirects newly synthesized MHC class I heavy chains via
    the SEC61 translocon to the cytosol where they undergo proteasome-
    dependent destruction. In consequence, infected cells are masked
    for immune recognition by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; single-pass type I membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed at early and late period of virus
    infection (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytomegaloviruses US6 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like H-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
