AC   P53969;
Sorting assembly machinery 50 kDa subunit (TOB complex 55 kDa
subunit).
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XIV
and its evolutionary implications.";
"An essential role of Sam50 in the protein sorting and assembly
machinery of the mitochondrial outer membrane.";
"Evolutionary conservation of biogenesis of beta-barrel membrane
proteins.";
"Assembly of the TOB complex of mitochondria.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the mitochondrial outer membrane sorting
    assembly machinery (SAM or TOB) complex, which is required for the
    sorting of proteins with complicated topology, such as beta-barrel
    proteins, to the mitochondrial outer membrane after import by the
    TOM complex.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the mitochondrial outer membrane sorting
    assembly machinery (SAM or TOB) complex, which at least consists
    of SAM35, SAM37 and SAM50.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Its C-terminal part contains many membrane-spanning sided
    beta-sheets, that have the potential to adopt a transmembrane
    "beta-barrel" type structure, in which the transmembrane domains
    can not be predicted by the TMHMM and ESKM prediction programs (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SAM50/omp85 family.
