AC   P22292; Q5E9W4;
Mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate/malate carrier protein (OGCP) (Solute
carrier family 25 member 11).
"Sequences of the human and bovine genes for the mitochondrial 2-
oxoglutarate carrier.";
"Sequence of the bovine 2-oxoglutarate/malate carrier protein:
structural relationship to other mitochondrial transport proteins.";
"Characterization of 954 bovine full-CDS cDNA sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the transport of 2-oxoglutarate across the
    inner mitochondrial membrane in an electroneutral exchange for
    malate or other dicarboxylic acids, and plays an important role in
    several metabolic processes, including the malate-aspartate
    shuttle, the oxoglutarate/isocitrate shuttle, in gluconeogenesis
    from lactate, and in nitrogen metabolism.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Heart, liver and brain.
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
