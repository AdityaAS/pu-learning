Outer membrane porin protein nmpC precursor.
"Structure of the lc and nmpC outer membrane porin protein genes of
lambdoid bacteriophage.";
"Sequence of minutes 4-25 of Escherichia coli.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Expression of the nmpC gene of Escherichia coli K-12 is modulated by
external pH. Identification of cis-acting regulatory sequences
involved in this regulation.";
"Holliday junction resolvases encoded by homologous rusA genes in
Escherichia coli K-12 and phage 82.";
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: In wild-type strains of E.coli K12, the nmpC open
    reading frame is interrupted by an IS5 insertion and generates a
    hybrid open reading frame that is not expressed. However, in
    mutant strain CS348, the IS5 element has been deleted and nmpC is
    expressed.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Gram-negative porin family.
