-!- FUNCTION: This is a second nitrate reductase enzyme which can
    substitute for the NRA enzyme and allows E.coli to use nitrate as
    an electron acceptor during anaerobic growth. The beta chain is an
    electron transfer unit containing four cysteine clusters involved
    in the formation of iron-sulfur centers. Electrons are transferred
    from the gamma chain to the molybdenum cofactor of the alpha
    subunit.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nitrite + acceptor = nitrate + reduced
    acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 3 4Fe-4S clusters per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 3Fe-4S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer of heterotrimers each composed of an alpha, a beta
    and a gamma chain. Alpha and beta are catalytic chains; gamma
    chains are involved in binding the enzyme complex to the
    cytoplasmic membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein.
