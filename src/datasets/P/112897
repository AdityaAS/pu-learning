-!- FUNCTION: Could facilitate a sensory photoresponse.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Highest expression in sexually differentiated
    cultures and conidia when there has been exposure to light. Also
    expressed during vegetative growth.
-!- PTM: Binds all-trans retinal via a protonated Schiff base linkage.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the archaeal/bacterial/fungal opsin family.
