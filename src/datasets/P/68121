AC   P15645;
General secretion pathway protein E (Type II traffic warden ATPase)
(Pullulanase secretion protein pulE).
"Pullulanase secretion in Escherichia coli K-12 requires a cytoplasmic
protein and a putative polytopic cytoplasmic membrane protein.";
"Protein secretion by Gram-negative bacteria. Characterization of two
membrane proteins required for pullulanase secretion by Escherichia
coli K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a general secretion pathway (GSP) for the
    export of proteins. Required for the translocation of pullulanase.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GSP E family.
