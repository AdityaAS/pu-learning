AC   P03959;
Potassium-transporting ATPase A chain (EC 3.6.3.12) (Potassium-
translocating ATPase A chain) (ATP phosphohydrolase [potassium-
transporting] A chain) (Potassium-binding and translocating subunit
A).
"Sequence homology between two membrane transport ATPases, the Kdp-
ATPase of Escherichia coli and the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic
reticulum.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the components of the high-affinity ATP-driven
    potassium transport (or KDP) system, which catalyzes the
    hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of hydrogen and
    potassium ions.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + K(+)(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    K(+)(In).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the kdpA family.
