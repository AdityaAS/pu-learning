-!- FUNCTION: Outer membrane channel protein that allows an efficient
    diffusion of low-molecular-weight solutes such as small sugars and
    tetraglycine. However, the specific substrate recognized by the
    ompL channel is unknown.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the oligogalacturonate-specific porin kdgM
    (TC 1.B.35) family. OmpL subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: In contrast to Ref.4, Ref.5 demonstrates that ompL
    actually plays no perceptible role in modulating redox potential
    in the periplasm of E.coli.
