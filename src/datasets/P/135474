Multiphosphoryl transfer protein (MTP) (Phosphotransferase FPr
protein) (Pseudo-HPr) [Includes: Phosphocarrier protein HPr (Protein
H); Fructose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA component
(EC 2.7.1.-) (PTS system fructose-specific EIIA component)].

-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in fructose transport (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIA N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine +
    protein EIIB = protein EIIA + protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By fructose (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: In contrast to classical PTS systems, the fructose PTS has
    no requirement for HPr; FPr combines a IIA domain with a HPr
    domain.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIA domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr on a
    histidyl residue. Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the
    EIIB domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HPr domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIA type-2 domain.
