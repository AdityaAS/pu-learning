AC   P33951;
ATP-binding protein syrD.
"SyrD is required for syringomycin production by Pseudomonas syringae
pathovar syringae and is related to a family of ATP-binding secretion
proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: ATP-driven efflux pump necessary for the secretion of
    syringomycin. May specifically bind syringomycin and translocate
    it to the periplasmic space. SyrD is also required for full
    expression of the syrB gene.
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
