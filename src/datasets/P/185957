AC   P39886;
Tetracenomycin C resistance and export protein.
"Sequence and transcriptional analysis of the Streptomyces glaucescens
tcmAR tetracenomycin C resistance and repressor gene loci.";
-!- FUNCTION: Resistance to tetracenomycin C by an active
    tetracenomycin C efflux system which is probably energized by
    transmembrane electrochemical gradients.
-!- PATHWAY: Antibiotic biosynthesis; tetracenomycin C biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. EmrB
    family.
