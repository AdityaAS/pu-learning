flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in the bacteriolysis. Is activated under
    conditions of high osmolarity by the factor sigma S. Entericidin A
    functions as an antidote (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ecnA/ecnB lipoprotein family.
