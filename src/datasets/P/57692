Cell division protein ftsW.
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a septum-peptidoglycan biosynthetic protein,
    involved in cell wall formation. Plays a role in the stabilization
    of the ftsZ ring during cell division (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ftsW/rodA/spoVE family.
