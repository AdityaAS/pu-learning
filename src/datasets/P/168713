AC   O88446;
Organic cation transporter 3 (Solute carrier family 22 member 3).
"Cloning and functional characterization of a potential-sensitive,
polyspecific organic cation transporter (OCT3) most abundantly
expressed in placenta.";
"Identity of the organic cation transporter OCT3 as the extraneuronal
monoamine transporter (uptake2) and evidence for the expression of the
transporter in the brain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates potential-dependent transport of a variety of
    organic cations. May play a significant role in the disposition of
    cationic neurotoxins and neurotransmitters in the brain.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in placenta. Moderate
    expression in intestine, heart and brain. In the brain, widely
    expressed, especially in hippocampus, cerebellum and cerebral
    cortex. Expression is low in kidney and lung and undetectable in
    liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Organic
    cation transporter family.
