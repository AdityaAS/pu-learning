-!- FUNCTION: Aerolysin is a cytolytic toxin exported by the Gram
    negative Aeromonas bacteria. The mature toxin binds to eukaryotic
    cells and aggregates to form holes approximatively 3 nm in
    diameter, leading to destruction of the membrane permeability
    barrier and osmotic lysis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer in solution; heptamer in the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aerolysin family.
