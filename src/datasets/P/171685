AC   P33303;
Succinate/fumarate mitochondrial transporter (Regulator of acetyl-CoA
synthetase activity).
"ACR1, a gene encoding a protein related to mitochondrial carriers, is
essential for acetyl-CoA synthetase activity in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae.";
"Complete nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
X.";
"Creation of the YFLEX clone resource: cloning of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae ORFs in the Gateway recombinational cloning system.";
"Identification of the yeast ACR1 gene product as a succinate-fumarate
transporter essential for growth on ethanol or acetate.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transports cytoplasmic succinate, derived from
    isocitrate by the action of isocitrate lyase in the cytosol, into
    the mitochondrial matrix in exchange for fumarate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By ethanol or acetate as sole carbon sources. Repressed
    by glucose.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
