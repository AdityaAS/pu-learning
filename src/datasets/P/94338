AC   P75957; Q9R7N6;
Lipoprotein-releasing system ATP-binding protein lolD (EC 3.6.3.-).
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"A new ABC transporter mediating the detachment of lipid-modified
proteins from membranes.";
"Disruption of lolCDE, encoding an ATP-binding cassette transporter,
is lethal for Escherichia coli and prevents release of lipoproteins
from the inner membrane.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex lolCDE involved in
    the translocation of mature outer membrane-directed lipoproteins,
    from the inner membrane to the periplasmic chaperone, lolA.
    Responsible for the formation of the lolA-lipoprotein complex in
    an ATP-dependent manner. Such a release is dependent of the
    sorting-signal (absence of an Asp at position 2 of the mature
    lipoprotein) and of lolA.
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (lolD) and two transmembrane proteins (lolC and lolE).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Lipoprotein
    translocase (TC 3.A.1.125) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
