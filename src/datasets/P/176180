AC   Q9UHB9; Q8NCJ4; Q8WUK2;
Signal recognition particle 68 kDa protein (SRP68).
"Signal recognition particle components in the nucleolus.";
"Complete sequencing and characterization of 21,243 full-length human
cDNAs.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Signal-recognition-particle assembly has a crucial role
    in targeting secretory proteins to the rough endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane. SRP68 binds the 7S RNA, SRP72 binds to this complex
    subsequently. This ribonucleoprotein complex might interact
    directly with the docking protein in the ER membrane and possibly
    participate in the elongation arrest function.
-!- SUBUNIT: Signal recognition particle consists of a 7S RNA molecule
    of 300 nucleotides and six protein subunits: SRP72, SRP68, SRP54,
    SRP19, SRP14 and SRP9.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus; nucleolus.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q9UHB9-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q9UHB9-2; Sequence=VSP_008347;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The RNA binding domain is located near the N-
    terminus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SRP68 family.
