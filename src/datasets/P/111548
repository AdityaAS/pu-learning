-!- FUNCTION: Acts in low affinity electroneutral exchange of protons
    for cations such as Na(+) or K(+) across membranes. Can also
    exchange Li(+) and Cs(+) with a lower affinity. Involved in
    vacuolar ion compartmentalization necessary for cell volume
    regulation and cytoplasmic Na(+) detoxification. Required during
    leaves expansion, probably to stimulate epidermal cell expansion.
    Confers competence to grow in high salinity conditions.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=24 mM for Na(+) (without CML18/CAM15);
      KM=15 mM for Na(+) (in presence of CML18/CAM15);
      KM=12 mM for K(+) (without CML18/CAM15);
      KM=17 mM for K(+) (in presence of CML18/CAM15);
-!- SUBUNIT: Calcium and pH-dependent interaction with CML18/CAM15
    (increases when pH decreases, better at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.5).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein. Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (Probable). Golgi apparatus;
    Golgi apparatus membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (Probable).
    Note=Tonoplast. Possibly also present in endoplasmic reticulum
    (ER) and Golgi apparatus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous, with higher levels around vascular
    tissues and guard cells.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Present in flowers, particularly in petals,
    stamens and anthers (including pollen). Slightly expressed in
    developing ovaries, strongly expressed in developing embryos and
    in siliques outer integuments (mostly in base and tips). During
    first days after germination, mainly localized in roots, including
    root tips. Later, ubiquitous except in root tips.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by NaCl, KCl and sorbitol in a ABA-dependent
    but SOS signaling-independent manner. Also induced by abscisic
    acid (ABA).
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Transgenic plants of agricultural interest (e.g.
    cotton, Brassica napus) that overexpress NHX1 have enhanced
    capability to grow on high saline soils.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibition of Na(+) transport activity but not of
    K(+) transport activity is mediated by binding with CML18/CAM15.
    Inhibited by the diuretic compound amiloride and its analogs
    ethylisopropyl-amiloride (EIPA), 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride
    (MIA), and benzamil. Also down-regulated by quinine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (TC 2.A.36.5.1)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.5 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
