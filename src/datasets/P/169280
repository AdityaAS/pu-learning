"Molecular cloning of cDNA for sapecin and unique expression of the
sapecin gene during the development of Sarcophaga peregrina.";
"Purification of three antibacterial proteins from the culture medium
of NIH-Sape-4, an embryonic cell line of Sarcophaga peregrina.";

"1H nuclear magnetic resonance study of the solution conformation of
an antibacterial protein, sapecin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sapecins, which are potent bactericidal proteins, are
    produced in response to injury. Sapecin is cytotoxic to Gram-
    positive bacteria, and to a lesser extent against Gram-negative
    bacteria.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Hemocytes and fat body.
-!- INDUCTION: By injury to the larval cell wall.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the invertebrate defensin family. Type 1
    subfamily.
