Long-chain-fatty-acid--CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.3) (Long-chain acyl-CoA
synthetase) (Acyl-CoA synthetase).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the esterification, concomitant with
    transport, of exogenous long-chain fatty acids into metabolically
    active CoA thioesters for subsequent degradation or incorporation
    into phospholipids (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a long-chain carboxylic acid + CoA = AMP
    + diphosphate + an acyl-CoA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By
    similarity). Note=Partially membrane-associated (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Activity is the highest with fatty acid substrates
    of > 10 carbon atoms (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATP-dependent AMP-binding enzyme
    family.
