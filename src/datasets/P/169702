AC   P30531;
Sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA transporter 1.
"Cloning of the human brain GABA transporter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Terminates the action of GABA by its high affinity
    sodium-dependent reuptake into presynaptic terminals.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with MPP5 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Note=Localized at the
    plasma membrane and in a subset of intracellular vesicles.
    Localized at the presynaptic terminals of interneurons (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The PDZ domain-binding motif is involved in the
    interaction with MPP5.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein is the target of psychomotor
    stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
