-!- FUNCTION: The ternary complex containing UFD1L, VCP and NPLOC4
    binds ubiquitinated proteins and is necessary for the export of
    misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytoplasm, where they are
    degraded by the proteasome. The NPLOC4-UFD1L-VCP complex regulates
    spindle disassembly at the end of mitosis and is necessary for the
    formation of a closed nuclear envelope (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Ubiquitin fusion protein degradation (UFD) pathway.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer with UFD1L. The heterodimer binds
    ubiquitinated proteins and VCP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Endoplasmic
    reticulum (By similarity). Nucleus (By similarity).
    Note=Associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear (By
    similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q8TAT6-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q8TAT6-2; Sequence=VSP_009789;
      Note=May be due to an intron retention. No experimental
      confirmation available;
-!- DOMAIN: Binds ubiquitinated proteins via its RanBP2-type zinc
    finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NPL4 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RanBP2-type zinc finger.
