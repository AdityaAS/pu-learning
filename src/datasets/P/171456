AC   Q9S1G9;
Selenate reductase subunit beta (EC 1.97.1.9) (Selenate reductase
iron-sulfur subunit).
"Cloning and sequencing of the genes encoding the periplasmic-
cytochrome B-containing selenate reductase of Thauera selenatis.";
"Purification and characterization of the selenate reductase from
Thauera selenatis.";
"Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the selenate
reductase from Thauera selenatis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Electron transfer subunit of the terminal reductase
    during anaerobic growth on selenate and nitrate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Selenite + H(2)O + acceptor = selenate +
    reduced acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 3Fe-4S cluster (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 3 4Fe-4S clusters (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimer of alpha, beta and gamma subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm. Note=Probably translocated
    together with serA, which possesses a Tat-type signal.
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Has potential use in bioremediation of waste sites
    contaminated with selenate, such as agricultural drainage waters.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
