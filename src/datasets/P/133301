AC   P04997; Q31NF0;
Photosystem Q(B) protein (32 kDa thylakoid membrane protein)
(Photosystem II protein D1).
"Expression of a family of psbA genes encoding a photosystem II
polypeptide in the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans R2.";
"Complete sequence of chromosome 1 of Synechococcus elongatus PCC
7942.";
"Different and rapid responses of four cyanobacterial psbA transcripts
to changes in light intensity.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the two reaction center proteins of the
    photosystem II.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cellular thylakoid membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Herbicides such as atrazine, BNT, diuron or ioxynil
    bind to Q(B) and blocks the electron transport.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Cyanobacteria are generally known to contain 2 to 3
    copies of the psbA gene.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the reaction center pufL/M/psbA/D family.
