membrane channel in Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Outer membrane channel protein allowing the entry of N-
    acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or sialic acid) into the bacteria
    (Probable). NanC proteins form high-conductance channels which are
    open at low membrane potentials and which have a weak anion
    selectivity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by N-acetylneuraminate and modulated by N-
    acetylglucosamine. This regulation occurs via the nanR and nagC
    regulators. NanC expression is also activated by the regulators
    cyclic AMP-catabolite activator protein, ompR, and cpxR.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the oligogalacturonate-specific porin kdgM
    (TC 1.B.35) family. NanC subfamily.
