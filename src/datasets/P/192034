-!- FUNCTION: Low-affinity potassium transport system. Interacts with
    trk system potassium uptake protein trkA and requires trkE for
    transport activity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the trkH potassium transport family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to frameshifts
    in positions 418 and 420.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (AAA67646) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 416.
