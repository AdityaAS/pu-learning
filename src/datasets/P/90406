lactis: location of the thioether bridges.";
-!- FUNCTION: Lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic)
    active on Gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal activity of
    lantibiotics is based on depolarization of energized bacterial
    cytoplasmic membranes, initiated by the formation of aqueous
    transmembrane pores. Lacticin 481 is a broad spectrum bacteriocin
    exhibiting activity against a wide range of lactic acid bacteria
    and C.tyrobutyricum.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer or homodimer.
-!- PTM: Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of
    Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether
    bonds with cysteine. This is followed by membrane translocation
    and cleavage of the modified precursor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type A lantibiotic family.
