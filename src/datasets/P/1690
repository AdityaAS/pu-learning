AC   O00400;
Acetyl-coenzyme A transporter 1 (AT-1) (Acetyl-CoA transporter)
(Solute carrier family 33 member 1).
"Expression cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a novel
membrane protein required for the formation of O-acetylated
gangliosides: a putative acetyl CoA transporter.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable acetyl-CoA transporter necessary for O-
    acetylation of gangliosides.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous. Detected in heart, brain,
    placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney and pancreas. With
    strongest signals in pancreas.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC33A transporter family.
