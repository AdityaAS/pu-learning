NAD(P) transhydrogenase subunit alpha part 1 (EC 1.6.1.2) (Pyridine
nucleotide transhydrogenase subunit alpha 1) (Nicotinamide nucleotide
transhydrogenase subunit alpha 1) (Proton-translocating
transhydrogenase component 1) (dI).
"Energy-transducing nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase:
nucleotide sequences of the genes and predicted amino acid sequences
of the subunits of the enzyme from Rhodospirillum rubrum.";
"Protein-protein recognition, hydride transfer and proton pumping in
the transhydrogenase complex.";
"The crystal structure of an asymmetric complex of the two nucleotide
binding components of proton-translocating transhydrogenase.";
-!- FUNCTION: The transhydrogenation between NADH and NADP is coupled
    to respiration and ATP hydrolysis and functions as a proton pump
    across the membrane (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADPH + NAD(+) = NADP(+) + NADH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex of an alpha and a beta chain; in Rhodospirillum,
    the alpha chain seems to be made of two subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the AlaDH/PNT family.
