Oligopeptide transport system permease protein oppC.
"Molecular characterization of the oligopeptide permease of Salmonella
typhimurium.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Membrane topology of the integral membrane components, OppB and OppC,
of the oligopeptide permease of Salmonella typhimurium.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for oligopeptides; probably responsible for the translocation of
    the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. OppBC subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
