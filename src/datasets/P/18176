-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex btuCDF involved in
    vitamin B12 import. Involved in the translocation of the substrate
    across the membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (btuD), two transmembrane proteins (btuC) and a solute-binding
    protein (btuF).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. FecCD subfamily.
