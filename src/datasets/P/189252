Protein tipE (Temperature-induced paralytic E).
"Cloning and functional analysis of TipE, a novel membrane protein
that enhances Drosophila para sodium channel function.";

systematic review.";
"A Drosophila full-length cDNA resource.";
-!- FUNCTION: Enhances para sodium channel function. Required during
    pupal development to rescue adult paralysis and also protects
    adult flys against heat-induced lethality.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Preferentially expressed in the central
    nervous system of developing embryos. The longer tipe forms are
    found predominantly in heads and legs, the short form in the body
    region.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed weakly in middle to late embryos,
    absent in larvae and is most abundantly expressed in middle to
    late pupal stages.
