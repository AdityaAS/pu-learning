AC   P05528;
Protein mcbE.
"The export of the DNA replication inhibitor Microcin B17 provides
immunity for the host cell.";
"DNA sequence, products, and transcriptional pattern of the genes
involved in production of the DNA replication inhibitor microcin
B17.";
-!- FUNCTION: Together with two further proteins mcbF and mcbG this
    protein causes immunity to the peptide antibiotic microcin B17
    (MccB17), which inhibits DNA replication in enterobacteriaceae.
    Immunity is determined by two different mechanisms. McbE is
    involved in the production of extracellular MccB17 and, in a
    complex with mcbF it also serves as "pump" for the export of
    active MccB17 from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
Antibiotic resistance; Membrane; Plasmid; Transmembrane; Transport.
