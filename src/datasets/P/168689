-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity transporter for the intake of thiamine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous; most abundant in skeletal and
    cardiac muscle. Medium expression in placenta, heart, liver and
    kidney, low in lung.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC19A2 are the cause of thiamine-responsive
    megaloblastic anemia syndrome (TRMA) [MIM:249270]; also known as
    Rogers syndrome. TRMA is an autosomal recessive disease with
    features that include megaloblastic anemia, mild thrombocytopenia
    and leucopenia, sensorineural deafness and diabetes mellitus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the reduced folate carrier (RFC)
    transporter (TC 2.A.48) family.
