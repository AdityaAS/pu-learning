-!- FUNCTION: Component of the TOM (translocase of outer membrane)
    receptor complex responsible for the recognition and translocation
    of cytosolically synthesized mitochondrial preproteins. Together
    with TOM20 and TOM22 functions as the transit peptide receptor at
    the surface of the mitochondrion outer membrane and facilitates
    the movement of preproteins into the TOM40 translocation pore.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms part of the TOM (translocase of outer membrane)
    complex that consists of at least 7 different proteins (TOM5,
    TOM6, TOM7, TOM20, TOM22, TOM40 and TOM70). In the complex
    interacts with TOM22. Interacts with TOM37.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 45300 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tom70 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 9 TPR repeats.
