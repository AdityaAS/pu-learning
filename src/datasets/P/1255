AC   Q52812; Q1MH71;
General L-amino acid-binding periplasmic protein aapJ precursor.
"The general L-amino acid permease of Rhizobium leguminosarum is an
ABC uptake system that also influences efflux of solutes.";
"The genome of Rhizobium leguminosarum has recognizable core and
accessory components.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a binding-protein-dependent transport system for
    L-amino acids, affects the uptake as well as efflux of these amino
    acids.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 3
    family.
