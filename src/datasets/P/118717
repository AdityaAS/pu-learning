-!- FUNCTION: Important role in absorbtion of dietary peptides. High-
    affinity transporter of alanylalanine. Dipeptide transport
    activity is proton dependent.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=48.8 uM for alanylalanine;
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 6;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
    Name=A;
      IsoId=P91679-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=B;
      IsoId=P91679-2; Sequence=VSP_015662;
    Name=C;
      IsoId=P91679-3; Sequence=VSP_015663;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in thorax and abdomen of females:
    apical epithelial membranes of midgut, rectum, and reproductive
    tract. Also expressed in neuropil of the central nervous system,
    with elevated expression within the alpha- and beta-lobes of the
    mushroom bodies.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed both maternally and zygotically.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PTR2/POT transporter (TC 2.A.17)
    family.
