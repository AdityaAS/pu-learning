AC   P0A381; P07130; P21255;
Pesticidal crystal protein cry3Aa precursor (Insecticidal delta-
endotoxin CryIIIA(a)) (Crystaline entomocidal protoxin) (73 kDa
crystal protein).
"Nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of a coleopteran-
active delta-endotoxin gene from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. san
diego.";
-!- FUNCTION: Promotes colloidosmotic lysis by binding to the midgut
    epithelial cells of Coleoptera.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: The crystal protein is produced during
    sporulation and is accumulated both as an inclusion and as part of
    the spore coat.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Toxic segment of the protein is located in the N-
    terminus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the delta endotoxin family.
Sporulation; Toxin.
