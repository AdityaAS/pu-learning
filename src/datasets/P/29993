AC   Q03727;
Transport/processing ATP-binding protein comA (EC 3.4.22.-).
"Genetic transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae: nucleotide
sequence analysis shows comA, a gene required for competence
induction, to be a member of the bacterial ATP-dependent transport
protein family.";
"Complete genome sequence of a virulent isolate of Streptococcus
pneumoniae.";
"Competence for genetic transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae:
organization of a regulatory locus with homology to two lactococcin A
secretion genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for induction of competence. Seems to transport
    the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. HlyB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase C39 domain.
