Potassium transporter 1 (AtPOT1) (AtKUP1) (AtKT1).
"A new family of K+ transporters from Arabidopsis that are conserved
across phyla.";
"AtKUP1: an Arabidopsis gene encoding high-affinity potassium
transport activity.";
"AtKUP1: a dual-affinity K+ transporter from Arabidopsis.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 2 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Phylogenetic relationships within cation transporter families of
Arabidopsis.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity potassium transporter that could play a
    major role in the uptake of potassium from the rhizosphere. May
    act as a low-affinity potassium transporter under high potassium
    concentrations. Could also transport rubidium.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=O22397-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O22397-2; Sequence=VSP_008984;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Detected in the whole mature plant but
    preferentially expressed in roots and stems, and in potassium-
    starved plants.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Low-affinity activity is strongly inhibited by
    barium or cesium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HAK/KUP transporter (TC 2.A.72) family.
