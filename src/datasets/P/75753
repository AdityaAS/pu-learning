Hemin import ATP-binding protein hmuV (EC 3.6.3.-).
"Molecular characterization of the hemin uptake locus (hmu) from
Yersinia pestis and analysis of hmu mutants for hemin and hemoprotein
utilization.";

-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex hmuTUV involved in
    hemin import. Responsible for energy coupling to the transport
    system (Probable).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (hmuV), two transmembrane proteins (hmuU) and a solute-binding
    protein (hmuT) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Heme (hemin)
    importer (TC 3.A.1.14.5) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
