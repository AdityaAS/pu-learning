-!- SUBUNIT: HA is composed of subcomponents having 53, 33, 22-23, and
    17 kDa. Botulinum toxins are produced as progenitor toxins of
    large molecular sizes of 12S (M toxin), 16S (L toxin) and 19S (LL
    toxin). M toxin consists of a nontoxic component and the
    neurotoxin. L toxin consists of the M toxin and HA.
