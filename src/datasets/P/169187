-!- FUNCTION: Component of the mitochondrial outer membrane sorting
    assembly machinery (SAM or TOB) complex, which is required for the
    sorting of proteins with complicated topology, such as beta-barrel
    proteins, to the mitochondrial outer membrane after import by the
    TOM complex.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the mitochondrial outer membrane sorting
    assembly machinery (SAM or TOB) complex, which at least consists
    of SAM35, SAM37 and SAM50. SAM37 interacts with TOM70.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1580 molecules/cell.
