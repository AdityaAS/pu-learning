AC   Q9ERZ8;
Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4
(TrpV4) (osm-9-like TRP channel 4) (OTRPC4) (Vanilloid receptor-
related osmotically-activated channel) (VR-OAC).
"Vanilloid receptor-related osmotically activated channel (VR-OAC), a
candidate vertebrate osmoreceptor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Non-selective calcium permeant cation channel probably
    involved in osmotic sensitivity and mechanosensitivity. Activation
    by exposure to hypotonicity within the physiological range
    exhibits an outward rectification. Also activated by low pH,
    citrate and phorbol esters. Increase of intracellular Ca(2+)
    potentiates currents. Channel activity seems to be regulated by a
    calmodulin-dependent mechanism with a negative feedback mechanism
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with calmodulin. Interacts with Map7 and Src
    family Tyr protein kinases LYN, SRC, FYN, HCK, LCK and YES (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed lung, spleen, kidney, testis, fat,
    and at very low levels in trigeminal ganglia.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. TrpV
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 ANK repeats.
