Glycerol uptake facilitator protein (Aquaglyceroporin).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transporter of glycerol across the cytoplasmic membrane,
    with limited permeability to water and small uncharged compounds
    such as polyols (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
