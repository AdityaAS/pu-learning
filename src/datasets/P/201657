Vacuolar ATP synthase subunit c'' (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-ATPase c'' subunit)
(Vacuolar proton pump c'' subunit) (V-ATPase 22 kDa proteolipid
subunit).
"A yeast protein, homologous to the proteolipid of the chromaffin
granule proton-ATPase, is important for cell growth.";
"Complete nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
VIII.";
"Creation of the YFLEX clone resource: cloning of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae ORFs in the Gateway recombinational cloning system.";
"VMA11 and VMA16 encode second and third proteolipid subunits of the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase.";

proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Proton-conducting pore forming subunit of the membrane
    integral V0 complex of vacuolar ATPase. V-ATPase is responsible
    for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in
    eukaryotic cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (components A to H) attached to an
    integral membrane V0 proton pore complex (components: a, c, c',
    c'', d and e). The proteolipid components c, c' and c'' are
    present as a hexameric ring that forms the proton-conducting pore.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P47135:JSN1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-20293, EBI-9422;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase proteolipid subunit family.
