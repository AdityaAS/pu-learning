NAD(P) transhydrogenase subunit beta (EC 1.6.1.2) (Pyridine nucleotide
transhydrogenase subunit beta) (Nicotinamide nucleotide
transhydrogenase subunit beta).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: The transhydrogenation between NADH and NADP is coupled
    to respiration and ATP hydrolysis and functions as a proton pump
    across the membrane (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADPH + NAD(+) = NADP(+) + NADH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta chain (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PNT beta subunit family.
