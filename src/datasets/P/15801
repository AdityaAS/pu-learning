Sensory rhodopsin-2 (Sensory rhodopsin II) (SR-II).
"The primary structures of the Archaeon Halobacterium salinarium blue
light receptor sensory rhodopsin II and its transducer, a methyl-
accepting protein.";
"Genome sequence of Halobacterium species NRC-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the control of phototaxis. Seems to activate
    a methyl-accepting protein (HTR-II). Photoreceptor for blue light.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the archaeal/bacterial/fungal opsin family.
