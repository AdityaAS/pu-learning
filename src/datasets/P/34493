-!- FUNCTION: Part of a cation efflux system that mediates resistance
    to copper and silver. Binds one copper per polypeptide.
-!- SUBUNIT: The cus efflux system is composed of cusA, cusB, cusC and
    cusF.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- INDUCTION: Transcriptionally regulated by cusR in response to
    copper and silver ions.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The cus system plays an important role in copper
    tolerance under anaerobic growth and, under extreme copper stress,
    in aerobic growth.
