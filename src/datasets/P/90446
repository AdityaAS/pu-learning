AC   Q60961;
Lysosomal-associated transmembrane protein 4A (Golgi 4-transmembrane
spanning transporter) (Mouse transporter protein) (MTP).
"Identification of a novel membrane transporter associated with
intracellular membranes by phenotypic complementation in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
-!- FUNCTION: May function in the transport of nucleosides and/or
    nucleoside derivatives between the cytosol and the lumen of an
    intracellular membrane-bound compartment.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Intracytoplasmic membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein (Potential). Isoform Short: Cell membrane; multi-
    pass membrane protein (Probable). Note=May reside in an
    intracellular membrane-bound compartment (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative initiation; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Long;
      IsoId=Q60961-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Short; Synonyms=Truncated, MTP1;
      IsoId=Q60961-2; Sequence=VSP_018821;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- DOMAIN: The C-terminal domain is necessary for retention within
    intracelllular membranes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the LAPTM4/LAPTM5 transporter family.
