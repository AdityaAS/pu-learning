AC   O08581;
Potassium channel subfamily K member 1 (Inward rectifying potassium
channel protein TWIK-1).
"The structure, function and distribution of the mouse TWIK-1 K+
channel.";
"Structure, chromosome localization, and tissue distribution of the
mouse twik K+ channel gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Weak inwardly rectifying potassium channel.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Highest expression in brain,
    kidney, thyroid, salivary gland, adrenal gland, prostate,
    epididymis, uterus, placenta, colon and jejunum. Moderate
    expression in eyes, pituitary, pancreas, smooth muscle, testis and
    ovary. Very low levels in lung, aorta, liver, heart, skeletal
    muscle, thymus and spleen. In the brain, highest expression in
    cerebellar granule cells, brainstem, hippocampus and cerebral
    cortex.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expression detected as early as 7 days post
    conception. Expression increases from 2-8 days after birth and
    stabilizes after day 8.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibited by quinine, barium, and internal
    acidification. Activated by protein kinase C.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the two pore domain potassium channel
    (TC 1.A.1.8) family.
