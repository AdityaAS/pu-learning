AC   P42953;
Teichoic acid translocation permease protein tagG.
"The tagGH operon of Bacillus subtilis 168 encodes a two-component ABC
transporter involved in the metabolism of two wall teichoic acids.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex tagGH
    (TC 3.A.1.34.1) involved in exporting the two types of
    intracellularly synthesized teichoic acids. Probably responsible
    for the translocation of the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (tagH) and two transmembrane proteins (tagG) (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC-2 integral membrane protein family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-2 domain.
