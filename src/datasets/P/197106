AC   P10861;
Mitochondrial brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) (Thermogenin)
(Fragment).
"Nucleotide sequence of a cDNA encoding bovine brown fat uncoupling
protein. Homology with ADP binding site of ADP/ATP carrier.";
-!- FUNCTION: UCP are mitochondrial transporter proteins that create
    proton leaks across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus
    uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis. As a
    result, energy is dissipated in the form of heat.
-!- SUBUNIT: Acts as a dimer forming a proton channel.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brown adipose tissue.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
