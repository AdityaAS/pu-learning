-!- FUNCTION: Uptake of galactose across the boundary membrane with
    the concomitant transport of protons into the cell (symport
    system).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
