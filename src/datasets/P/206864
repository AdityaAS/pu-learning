-!- FUNCTION: Required for the extracellular polysaccharide colanic
    acid synthesis. The autophosphorylated form is inactive. Probably
    involved in the export of colanic acid from the cell to medium.
    Phosphorylates udg.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + a
    [protein]-L-tyrosine phosphate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Dephosphorylated and activated by wzb.
-!- PATHWAY: Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- PTM: Autophosphorylated. Seems to be phosphorylated through a
    cooperative two-step mechanism. First, Tyr-569 is phosphorylated
    in an intramolecular reaction that generates a significant
    increase of protein kinase activity. Then Tyr-708, Tyr-710, Tyr-
    711, Tyr-713 and Tyr-715 are phosphorylated in an intermolecular
    Tyr-569-dependent reaction.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Additional site-directed mutagenesis experiments
    indicated that the tyrosine residues at positions 708, 710, 711,
    713 and 715 are phosphorylation sites, whereas tyrosine at
    position 705 is not.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the etk/wzc family.
