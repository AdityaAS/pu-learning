AC   P39843;
Multidrug resistance protein 2 (Multidrug-efflux transporter 2).
"Two highly similar multidrug transporters of Bacillus subtilis whose
expression is differentially regulated.";
"Systematic sequencing of the 283 kb 210 degrees-232 degrees region of
the Bacillus subtilis genome containing the skin element and many
sporulation genes.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased
    drug accumulation in multi-drug-resistant cells. Probably uses a
    transmembrane proton gradient as the energy source. Causes the
    efflux of a variety of toxic substances, including such
    structurally diverse compounds as ethidium bromide, rhodamine and
    acridine dyes, tetraphenylphosphonium, puromycin, chloramphenicol,
    doxorubicin, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. TCR/tet
    family.
Antibiotic resistance; Complete proteome; Membrane; Transmembrane;
