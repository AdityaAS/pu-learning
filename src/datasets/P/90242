"Molecular analysis of the lac operon encoding the binding-protein-
dependent lactose transport system and beta-galactosidase in
Agrobacterium radiobacter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for lactose. Probably responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
