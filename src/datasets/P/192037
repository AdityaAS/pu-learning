flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: Low-affinity potassium transport system. Interacts with
    trk system potassium uptake protein trkA and requires trkE for
    transport activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the trkH potassium transport family.
