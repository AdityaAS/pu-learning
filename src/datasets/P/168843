-!- FUNCTION: Play an important role in cellular zinc homeostasis as a
    zinc transporter. Regulated in response to zinc availability (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Endosome; recycling endosome; recycling endosomal membrane; multi-
    pass membrane protein. Note=Colocalized with TFRC in the recycling
    endosomes. Cycles between endosomal compartments and the plasma
    membrane in response to zinc availability.

      IsoId=Q6P5W5-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q6P5W5-2; Sequence=VSP_015911, VSP_015912;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in kidney, small intestine,
    stomach, colon, jejunum and duodenum.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC39A4 are the cause of acrodermatitis
    enteropathica zinc-deficiency type (AEZ) [MIM:201100]. AEZ is a
    rare autosomal recessive disease caused by the inability to absorb
    sufficient zinc. The clinicals features are growth retardation,
    immune-system dysfunction, alopecia, severe dermatitis, diarrhea
    and occasionally mental disorders. All these manifestations are
    reversible with zinc supplementation. Without zinc therapy this
    disease is fatal.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ZIP transporter (TC 2.A.5) family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (BAA91091) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 573, 598 and 618.
