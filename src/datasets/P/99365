AC   Q27433;
Mechanosensory protein 2.
"A stomatin-like protein necessary for mechanosensation in C.
elegans.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
"The mechanosensory protein MEC-6 is a subunit of the C. elegans
touch-cell degenerin channel.";
-!- FUNCTION: Positively regulates the activity of the putative
    mechanosensory transduction channel. May link the mechanosensory
    channel and the microtubule cytoskeleton of the touch receptor
    neurons. Required for the function of a set of six touch receptor
    neurons.
-!- SUBUNIT: The channel is probably composed of at least the mec-2,
    mec-4, mec-6 and mec-10 subunits.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the band 7/mec-2 family.
