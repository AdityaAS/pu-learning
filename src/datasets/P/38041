Cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein czcA (Cation efflux system
protein czcA).
"Expression and nucleotide sequence of a plasmid-determined divalent
cation efflux system from Alcaligenes eutrophus.";
"Sequence and features of the Ralstonia metallidurans CH34 heavy
metals plasmids pMOL28 and pMOL30.";
"Complete sequence of plasmid pMOL30 of Ralstonia metallidurans
CH34.";
"The czc operon of Alcaligenes eutrophus CH34: from resistance
mechanism to the removal of heavy metals.";
-!- FUNCTION: Has a low cation transport activity for cobalt, it is
    essential for the expression of cobalt, zinc, and cadmium
    resistance. CzcA and czcB together would act in zinc efflux nearly
    as effectively as the complete CZC efflux system (czcABC).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: By zinc, cadmium and cobalt (zinc being the best and
    cobalt being the worst inducer).
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: In the presence of 2 mM Cd(2+) or 4-10 mM Zn(2+) up
    to 99% of the metal is removed from the culture supernatant and is
    sequestered via bioprecipitation. Additionally Cu(2+), Co(2+),
    Ni(2+), Pb(2+), Y(3+) and Ge(4+) can also be removed from culture
    supernatants, although it is not clear which efflux system is
    responsible for all these substrates (Ref.5).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acrB/acrD/acrF (TC 2.A.6) family.
