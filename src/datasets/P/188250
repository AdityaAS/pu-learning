-!- FUNCTION: Thionins are small plant proteins which are toxic to
    animal cells. They seem to exert their toxic effect at the level
    of the cell membrane. Their precise function is not known.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=4852.5; METHOD=Electrospray; RANGE=7-52;
    NOTE=Ref.3.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the plant thionin (TC 1.C.44) family.
