-!- FUNCTION: Resistance to tetracycline by an active tetracycline
    efflux. This is an energy-dependent process that decreases the
    accumulation of the antibiotic in whole cells. This protein
    functions as a metal-tetracycline/H(+) antiporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. TCR/tet
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (AAA26034) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in positions 265, 433, 442 and 453.
