AC   O34992;
Glycine betaine/carnitine/choline transport ATP-binding protein opuCA.
"Two evolutionarily closely related ABC transporters mediate the
uptake of choline for synthesis of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine
in Bacillus subtilis.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a high affinity multicomponent binding-
    protein-dependent transport system for glycine betaine, carnitine
    and choline; probably responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 CBS domains.
Amino-acid transport; ATP-binding; CBS domain; Complete proteome;
Nucleotide-binding; Repeat; Transport.
