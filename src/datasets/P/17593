Boron transporter 1.
"Arabidopsis boron transporter for xylem loading.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 2 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
"Endocytosis and degradation of BOR1, a boron transporter of
Arabidopsis thaliana, regulated by boron availability.";
-!- FUNCTION: Efflux-type boron transporter for xylem loading. Boron
    is essential for maintaining the integrity of plants cell walls.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in root pericycle cells.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Shortly after high-concentration boron application,
    BOR1 is transferred from the plasma membrane via the endosomes to
    the vacuole for degradation. This avoid accumulation of toxic
    levels of boron in shoots under high-boron supply, while
    protecting the shoot from boron deficiency under boron limitation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the anion exchanger (TC 2.A.31) family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
