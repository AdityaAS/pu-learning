Holin (Lysis protein 13).
"Phage P22 lysis genes: nucleotide sequences and functional
relationships with T4 and lambda genes.";
"Sequence of the genome of Salmonella bacteriophage P22.";
"Corrected sequence of the bacteriophage P22 genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential for lysis of the bacterial cell wall by
    disrupting the cell membrane, thereby giving hydrolytic enzymes
    access to the cell wall.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lambda phage S protein family.
Direct protein sequencing; Late protein; Phage lysis protein.
