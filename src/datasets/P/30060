AC   P39145;
ComF operon protein 1 (EC 3.6.1.-) (ATP-dependent helicase comFA).
"comF, a Bacillus subtilis late competence locus, encodes a protein
similar to ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicases.";
"Sequence of the Bacillus subtilis 168 chromosomal region from 305 to
307 degree.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in transformation (competence for DNA uptake).
    Required for DNA uptake but not for binding. May provide the
    driving force for transport of DNA through an aqueous channel.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the helicase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase C-terminal domain.
