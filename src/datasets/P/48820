AC   Q08299;
Siderophore iron transporter ENB1 (Siderophore iron transporter ARN4)
(Enterobactin permease).

proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the transport of siderophore enterobactin
    and so has a role in iron homeostasis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endosome; endosomal membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.
