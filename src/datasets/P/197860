-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active-
    transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in ascorbate transport.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by L-ascorbate. Repressed by ulaR.
-!- DOMAIN: In classical PTS systems, the EIIC domain forms the
    translocation channel and contains the specific substrate-binding
    site. UlaA does not exhibit the topological features of any
    recognized enzyme IIC.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ulaA family.
