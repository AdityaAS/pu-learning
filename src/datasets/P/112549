AC   P35120;
Nopaline-binding periplasmic protein precursor.
"Opine transport genes in the octopine (occ) and nopaline (noc)
catabolic regions in Ti plasmids of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.";
"The genome of the natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens
C58.";
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen and biotechnology agent
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the nopaline active transport system
    probably consisting of four subunits: Q, M, P and T. This system
    is also capable of transporting octopine provided that catabolic
    functions are induced with nopaline.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 3
    family.
