Putative copper-transporting ATPase PAA1 (EC 3.6.3.4).
"Cloning of a cDNA encoding a putative metal-transporting P-type
ATPase from Arabidopsis thaliana.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 4 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in copper transport (Potential).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Cu(2+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    Cu(2+)(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HMA domain.
