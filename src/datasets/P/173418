Sodium-dependent acetylcholine transporter (Sodium:neurotransmitter
symporter family protein 6).
"SNF-6 is an acetylcholine transporter interacting with the dystrophin
complex in Caenorhabditis elegans.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates sodium-dependent uptake of acetylcholine at
    neuromuscular junctions during periods of increased synaptic
    activity, may also prevent spillover to adjacent synaptic sites.
    Not involved in the uptake of other neurotransmitters (GABA,
    glycine, proline and glutamate) and there was also no inhibition
    of uptake by adding an excess of other candidate substrates (GABA,
    glycine, taurine, creatine, proline, alanine, carnitine, glutamate
    and betaine). Required for muscle integrity; altered transport of
    acetylcholine due to loss of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC)
    function results in muscle degeneration.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with stn-1; part of the DGC.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q93646:stn-1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-447522, EBI-447079;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Note=The DGC is not necessary to establish snf-6 at the
    postsynaptic membrane, but it is required for maintenance or
    stabilization.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Body wall, and vulval and enteric muscles.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
