AC   P39137;
Amino-acid permease rocE.
"Expression of the rocDEF operon involved in arginine catabolism in
Bacillus subtilis.";
"36kb sequence between gntZ and trnY of B. subtilis genome.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Putative transport protein involved in arginine
    degradative pathway. Probably transports arginine or ornithine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Expression is sigma L dependent, induced by arginine,
    ornithine or proline.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. Amino acid transporter (AAT) (TC 2.A.3.1) family.
