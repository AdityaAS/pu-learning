Choline transport ATP-binding protein opuBA.
"Characterization of a chimeric proU operon in a subtilin-producing
mutant of Bacillus subtilis 168.";
"Two evolutionarily closely related ABC transporters mediate the
uptake of choline for synthesis of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine
in Bacillus subtilis.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a high affinity multicomponent binding-
    protein-dependent transport system for choline. Probably
    responsible for energy coupling to the transport system.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: LH45 is not a natural strain. It has been
    constructed by transformation of strain 168 with linear DNA from
    B.subtilis ATCC 6633. It is a subtilin-producing mutant of
    B.subtilis 168.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 CBS domains.
