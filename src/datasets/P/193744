AC   Q9XSM3;
Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 5
(TrpV5) (osm-9-like TRP channel 3) (OTRPC3) (Epithelial calcium
channel 1) (ECaC1).
"Molecular identification of the apical Ca2+ channel in 1, 25-
dihydroxyvitamin D3-responsive epithelia.";
"The single pore residue Asp542 determines Ca2+ permeation and Mg2+
block of the epithelial Ca2+ channel.";
"Homo- and heterotetrameric architecture of the epithelial Ca2+
channels TRPV5 and TRPV6.";
"The carboxyl terminus of the epithelial Ca(2+) channel ECaC1 is
involved in Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Constitutively active calcium selective cation channel
    thought to be involved in Ca(2+) reabsorption in kidney and
    intestine. The channel is activated by low internal calcium level
    and the current exhibits an inward rectification. A Ca(2+)-
    dependent feedback regulation includes fast channel inactivation
    and slow current decay. Heteromeric assembly with TRPV6 seems to
    modify channel properties. TRPV5-TRPV6 heteromultimeric
    concatemers exhibit voltage-dependent gating.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer and probably heterotetramer with TRPV6.
    Interacts with TRPV6. Interacts with S100A10 and probably with the
    ANAX2-S100A10 heterotetramer. The interaction with S100A10 is
    required for the trafficking to the plasma membrane. Interacts
    with calmodulin. Interacts with BSPRY, which results in its
    inactivation (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; apical cell membrane; multi-
    pass membrane protein (By similarity). Note=Colocalized with
    S100A10 and ANAX2 along the apical domain of kidney distal tubular
    cells (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. TrpV
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 ANK repeats.
