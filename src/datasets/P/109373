Nitrite extrusion protein 2 (Nitrite facilitator 2).
"A 570-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 28.0-40.1 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains

nitrate reductase and comparison with that encoded by the narGHJI
operon.";

-!- FUNCTION: Involved in excretion of nitrite produced by the
    dissimilatory reduction of nitrate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Since the transport is controlled by oxygen, five
    Cys residues in narU may play an important role in sensing redox
    potential to regulate the facilitator.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the narK/nasA transporter family.
