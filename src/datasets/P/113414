-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in actively transporting phosphate into
    cells via Na(+) cotransport in the renal brush border membrane.
    Probably mediates 70-80% of the apical influx.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts via its C-terminal region with PDZK2 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Kidney.
-!- INDUCTION: By low-phosphate diet.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The cotransport has a Na(+):Pi stoichiometry of 3:1
    and is electrogenic.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: PTH induces lysosomal degradation of the
    cotransporter.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC34A transporter family.
