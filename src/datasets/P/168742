AC   Q9WVC8;
Chloride anion exchanger (Protein DRA) (Down-regulated in adenoma)
(Solute carrier family 26 member 3).
"Mouse down-regulated in adenoma (DRA) is an intestinal
Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger and is up-regulated in colon of mice lacking
the NHE3 Na(+)/H(+) exchanger.";
-!- FUNCTION: Chloride/bicarbonate exchanger. Involved in absorbtion
    of in the colon. Helps mediate electrolyte and fluid absorption.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PDZK1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC26A/SulP transporter (TC 2.A.53)
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 STAS domain.
