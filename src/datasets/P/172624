Sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3) (NHE-3) (Solute
carrier family 9 member 3).
"Molecular cloning of putative members of the Na/H exchanger gene
family. cDNA cloning, deduced amino acid sequence, and mRNA tissue
expression of the rat Na/H exchanger NHE-1 and two structurally
related proteins.";
"Acute inhibition of Na/H exchanger NHE-3 by cAMP. Role of protein
kinase a and NHE-3 phosphoserines 552 and 605.";
"Shank2 associates with and regulates Na+/H+ exchanger 3.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in pH regulation to eliminate acids generated
    by active metabolism or to counter adverse environmental
    conditions. Major proton extruding system driven by the inward
    sodium ion chemical gradient. Plays an important role in signal
    transduction.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds SLC9A3R1 and SLC9A3R2 (By similarity). Interacts
    with SHANK2.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q9QX74:Shank2; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-961694, EBI-397902;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Most abundant in colon and small intestine,
    followed by kidney and stomach.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by PKA, which inhibits activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (TC 2.A.36.5.1)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: The number, localization and denomination of hydrophobic
    domains in the Na(+)/H(+) exchangers vary among authors.
