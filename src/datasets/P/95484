AC   Q6Z2T3;
Silicon transporter LSI1 (Low silicon protein 1).
"A silicon transporter in rice.";
"Oryza sativa nipponbare chromosome 2 genomic DNA sequence.";
"Collection, mapping, and annotation of over 28,000 cDNA clones from
japonica rice.";
-!- FUNCTION: Silicon transporter. Silicon is beneficial to plant
    growth and helps plants to overcome abiotic and biotic stresses by
    preventing lodging (falling over) and increasing resistance to
    pests and diseases, as well as other stresses.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Mainly expressed in the roots. In roots, it
    localizes in the main and lateral roots, but not in root hairs.
    Within a root, it localizes on the plasma membrane of the distal
    side of both exodermis and endodermis, where casparian strips
    exist (at protein level).
-!- INDUCTION: Regulated by silicon level; the expression being
    decreased by one-quarter by continuous silicon supply for 3 days.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
