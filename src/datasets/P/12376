AC   P13586;
Calcium-transporting ATPase 1 (EC 3.6.3.8) (Golgi Ca(2+)-ATPase).
"The yeast secretory pathway is perturbed by mutations in PMR1, a
member of a Ca2+ ATPase family.";
"A putative helicase, the SUA5, PMR1, tRNALys1 genes and four open
reading frames have been detected in the DNA sequence of an 8.8 kb
fragment of the left arm of chromosome VII of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII.";
"Isolation and characterization of SUA5, a novel gene required for
normal growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
"A global topology map of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: This magnesium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis
    of ATP coupled with the transport of calcium. Has a role in the
    secretory pathway.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Ca(2+)(Cis) = ADP + phosphate +
    Ca(2+)(Trans).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 6900 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family.
