Low-affinity glucose transporter HXT4 (Low-affinity glucose
transporter LGT1).
"High-copy suppression of glucose transport defects by HXT4 and
regulatory elements in the promoters of the HXT genes in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae.";
"Low-affinity glucose carrier gene LGT1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a
homologue of the Kluyveromyces lactis RAG1 gene.";
"Complete nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
VIII.";
"A subset of membrane-associated proteins is ubiquitinated in response
to mutations in the endoplasmic reticulum degradation machinery.";
-!- FUNCTION: Low-affinity glucose transporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Glucose transport is thought to be mediated by two
    kinetically distinct systems, a glucose-repressible high-affinity
    system and a constitutive low-affinity system.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
