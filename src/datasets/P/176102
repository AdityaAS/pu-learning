"Isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding the 19 kDa
protein of signal recognition particle (SRP): expression and binding
to 7SL RNA.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";

signal recognition particle.";
-!- FUNCTION: Signal-recognition-particle assembly, binds directly to
    7S RNA and mediates binding of the 54 kDa subunit of the SRP.
-!- SUBUNIT: Signal recognition particle consists of a 7S RNA molecule
    of 300 nucleotides and six protein subunits: SRP72, SRP68, SRP54,
    SRP19, SRP14 and SRP9.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SRP19 family.
