AC   P37080;
Sorbose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA component (EC 2.7.1.-)
(PTS system sorbose-specific EIIA component) (EIIA-Sor) (EIII-F-Sor).
"Sequence of the sor-operon for L-sorbose utilization from Klebsiella
pneumoniae KAY2026.";
"Molecular analysis of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent L-sorbose:
phosphotransferase system from Klebsiella pneumoniae and of its
multidomain structure.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in sorbose transport.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIA N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine +
    protein EIIB = protein EIIA + protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIA domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr on a
    histidyl residue. Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the
    EIIB domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIA type-4 domain.
