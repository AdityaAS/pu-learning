"Triticum aestivum puroindolines, two basic cystine-rich seed
proteins: cDNA sequence analysis and developmental gene expression.";
"Complete amino acid sequence of puroindoline, a new basic and
cystine-rich protein with a unique tryptophan-rich domain, isolated
from wheat endosperm by Triton X-114 phase partitioning.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts as a membranotoxin, probably through its
    antibacterial and antifungal activities, contributing to the
    defense mechanism of the plant against predators.
