Pesticidal crystal protein cry1Aa (Insecticidal delta-endotoxin
CryIA(a)) (Crystaline entomocidal protoxin) (133 kDa crystal protein)
(Fragment).
"Nucleotide sequence coding for the insecticidal fragment of the
Bacillus thuringiensis crystal protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Promotes colloidosmotic lysis by binding to the midgut
    epithelial cells of many lepidopteran larvae.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: The crystal protein is produced during
    sporulation and is accumulated both as an inclusion and as part of
    the spore coat.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Toxic segment of the protein is located in the N-
    terminus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the delta endotoxin family.
Plasmid; Sporulation; Toxin.
