-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex phnCDE involved in
    phosphonates, phosphate esters, phosphite and phosphate import.
    Responsible for energy coupling to the transport system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + phosphonate(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + phosphonate(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (phnC), two transmembrane proteins (phnE) and a solute-binding
    protein (phnD) (Probable).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0A6F5:groL; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1134635, EBI-543750;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Phosphonates utilization is cryptic in strain K12.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Phosphonates
    importer (TC 3.A.1.9.1) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
