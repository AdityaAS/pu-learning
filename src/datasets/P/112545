AC   P35116;
Nopaline permease ATP-binding protein P.
"Opine transport genes in the octopine (occ) and nopaline (noc)
catabolic regions in Ti plasmids of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.";
"The genome of the natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens
C58.";
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen and biotechnology agent
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the nopaline active transport system
    probably consisting of four subunits: Q, M, P and T. This system
    is also capable of transporting octopine provided that catabolic
    functions are induced with nopaline.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
