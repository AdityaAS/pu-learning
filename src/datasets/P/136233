Sorbose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIB component (EC 2.7.1.69)
(PTS system sorbose-specific EIIB component) (EIIB-Sor) (EIII-B-Sor).
"Sequence of the sor-operon for L-sorbose utilization from Klebsiella
pneumoniae KAY2026.";
"Molecular analysis of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent L-sorbose:
phosphotransferase system from Klebsiella pneumoniae and of its
multidomain structure.";

Klebsiella pneumoniae solved to 1.75A resolution.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in sorbose transport.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine + sugar = protein EIIB + sugar phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIB domain is phosphorylated by phospho-EIIA on a
    cysteinyl or histidyl residue, depending on the transported sugar.
    Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the sugar substrate
    concomitantly with the sugar uptake processed by the EIIC domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIB type-4 domain.
