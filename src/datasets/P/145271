-!- FUNCTION: Conducts the efflux of threonine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the rht family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (AAA67619) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 80 and 118.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.5 sequence differs from that shown due to frameshifts
    in positions 47 and 73.
