Aquaporin-6 (AQP-6) (Aquaporin-2-like) (hKID).
"cDNA cloning and gene structure of a novel water channel expressed
exclusively in human kidney: evidence for a gene cluster of aquaporins
at chromosome locus 12q13.";
-!- FUNCTION: Forms a water-specific channel that participates in
    distinct physiological functions such as glomerular filtration,
    tubular endocytosis and acid-base metabolism (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic vesicle; cytoplasmic vesicle
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
