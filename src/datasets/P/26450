Mg(2+)/citrate complex secondary transporter.
"Secondary transporters for citrate and the Mg(2+)-citrate complex in
Bacillus subtilis are homologous proteins.";

of the Bacillus subtilis genome reveal genes for a new two-component
system, three spore germination proteins, an iron uptake system and a
general stress response protein.";

-!- FUNCTION: Proton motive force-driven secondary transporter that
    mediates the transport of citrate complexed to Mg(2+).
    Cotransports at least two protons per Mg(2+)-citrate complex. Can
    also transport citrate in complex with Ni(2+), Mn(2+), Co(2+), and
    Zn(2+).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: The uptake activity increases with increasing
    Mg(2+) concentrations. Inhibited by FCCP, TCC and nigericin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Expression is under strict control of the medium
    composition. Induced by citrate, via the two-component regulatory
    system citT/citS. Repressed by rapidly metabolized carbon sources
    like glucose, glycerol and inositol, via the carbon catabolite
    repression system. Is also repressed by succinate and glutamate,
    albeit to a lesser extent.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the citM transporter family.
