-!- FUNCTION: The lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids takes place
    by the sequential action of specific hydrolases. Some of these
    enzymes require specific low-molecular mass, non-enzymic proteins:
    the sphingolipids activator proteins (coproteins).
-!- FUNCTION: Saposin A and saposin C stimulate the hydrolysis of
    glucosylceramide by beta-glucosylceramidase (EC 3.2.1.45) and
    galactosylceramide by beta-galactosylceramidase (EC 3.2.1.46).
    Saposin C apparently acts by combining with the enzyme and acidic
    lipid to form an activated complex, rather than by solubilizing
    the substrate.
-!- FUNCTION: Saposin B stimulates the hydrolysis of galacto-
    cerebroside sulfate by arylsulfatase A (EC 3.1.6.8), GM1
    gangliosides by beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) and
    globotriaosylceramide by alpha-galactosidase A (EC 3.2.1.22).
    Saposin B forms a solubilizing complex with the substrates of the
    sphingolipid hydrolases.
-!- FUNCTION: Saposin D is a specific sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase
    activator (EC 3.1.4.12).
-!- SUBUNIT: Saposin B is a homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Lysosome.

-!- PTM: This precursor is proteolytically processed to 4 small
    peptides, which are similar to each other and are sphingolipid
    hydrolase activator proteins.
-!- PTM: N-linked glycans show a high degree of microheterogeneity.
-!- PTM: The one residue extended Saposin B-Val is only found in 5% of
    the chains.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PSAP saposin B region are the cause of a
    variant of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) [MIM:249900].
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PSAP saposin C region are the cause of a
    variant of Gaucher disease [MIM:176801].
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PSAP saposin D region are the cause of a
    variant of Tay-Sachs disease (GM2-gangliosidosis).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Saposin B co-purifies with 1 molecule of
    phosphatidylethanolamine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 saposin A-type domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 saposin B-type domains.
