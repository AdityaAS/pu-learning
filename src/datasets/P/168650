AC   P70545;
Solute carrier family 13 member 2 (Intestinal sodium/dicarboxylate
cotransporter) (Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter 1) (NaDC-1).
"Cloning of the cDNA for a rat intestinal Na+/dicarboxylate
cotransporter reveals partial sequence homology with a rat intestinal
mucin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cotransport of sodium ions and dicarboxylates such as
    succinate and citrate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC13A transporter (TC 2.A.47) family.
    NADC subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to several
    frameshifts.
