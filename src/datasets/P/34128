AC   Q09143; P30824;
High-affinity cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT-1) (CAT1) (System
Y+ basic amino acid transporter) (Ecotropic retroviral leukemia
receptor) (ERR) (Ecotropic retrovirus receptor).
"A putative murine ecotropic retrovirus receptor gene encodes a
multiple membrane-spanning protein and confers susceptibility to virus
infection.";
"Transport of cationic amino acids by the mouse ecotropic retrovirus
receptor.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity, low capacity permease involved in the
    transport of the cationic amino acids (arginine, lysine and
    ornithine) in non-hepatic tissues. May also function as an
    ecotropic retroviral leukemia receptor.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highest levels found in the testis and bone
    marrow. Not found in the liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. Cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) (TC 2.A.3.3)
    family.
