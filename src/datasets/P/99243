AC   P13568;
Multidrug resistance protein (EC 3.6.3.44) (Chloroquine resistance
protein).
"Amplification of the multidrug resistance gene in some chloroquine-
resistant isolates of P. falciparum.";
"Amplification of the multidrug resistance gene pfmdr1 in Plasmodium
falciparum has arisen as multiple independent events.";
"Amplification of pfmdr 1 associated with mefloquine and halofantrine
resistance in Plasmodium falciparum from Thailand.";
-!- FUNCTION: Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased
    drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + xenobiotic(In) = ADP + phosphate
    + xenobiotic(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: P.falciparum resistant to the drug chloroquine have
    multiple copies of the gene coding for MDR.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transmembrane type-1 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
