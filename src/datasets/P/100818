-!- FUNCTION: Could be a transporter for 3-phenylpropionate
    (hydrocinnamic acid).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (D85613) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 105 and 163.
