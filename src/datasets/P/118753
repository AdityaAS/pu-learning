AC   O34878;
Glycine betaine/carnitine/choline transport system permease protein
opuCB.
"Two evolutionarily closely related ABC transporters mediate the
uptake of choline for synthesis of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine
in Bacillus subtilis.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a high affinity multicomponent binding-
    protein-dependent transport system for glycine betaine, carnitine
    and choline; probably responsible for the translocation of the
    substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. CysTW subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
