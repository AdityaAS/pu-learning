Cell invasion protein sipD (Salmonella invasion protein D).
"Salmonella typhimurium secreted invasion determinants are homologous
to Shigella Ipa proteins.";
"Identification of two targets of the type III protein secretion
system encoded by the inv and spa loci of Salmonella typhimurium that
have homology to the Shigella IpaD and IpaA proteins.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"The invasion-associated type III system of Salmonella typhimurium
directs the translocation of Sip proteins into the host cell.";
"The putative invasion protein chaperone SicA acts together with InvF
to activate the expression of Salmonella typhimurium virulence
genes.";
"Salmonella type III secretion-associated protein InvE controls
translocation of effector proteins into host cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for translocation of effector proteins via the
    type III secretion system SPI-1, which is essential for an
    efficient bacterial internalization. Probably acts by modulating
    the secretion of sipA, sipB, and sipC.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein. Note=Secreted via the type
    III secretion system 1 (SPI-1 TTSS).
-!- INDUCTION: Transcriptionally regulated by sicA and invF. Also
    regulated by invE.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sipD/ipaD family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 333.
Complete proteome; Virulence.
