Lysine-arginine-ornithine-binding periplasmic protein precursor (LAO-
binding protein).
"Construction of a contiguous 874-kb sequence of the Escherichia coli-
K12 genome corresponding to 50.0-68.8 min on the linkage map and
analysis of its sequence features.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"The hisT-purF region of the Escherichia coli K-12 chromosome.
Identification of additional genes of the hisT and purF operons.";
"Comparing the predicted and observed properties of proteins encoded
in the genome of Escherichia coli K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: This periplasmic binding protein is involved in an
    arginine transport system. ArgT and histidine-binding protein J
    (hisJ) interact with a common membrane-bound receptor, hisP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by argK.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 3
    family.
