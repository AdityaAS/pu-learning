AC   P0ADC4; P75956; Q9R7N7;
Lipoprotein-releasing system transmembrane protein lolC.
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of an ATP-dependent transport system lolCDE
    responsible for the release of lipoproteins targeted to the outer
    membrane from the inner membrane. Such a release is dependent of
    the sorting-signal (absence of an Asp at position 2 of the mature
    lipoprotein) and of lolA (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC-4 integral membrane protein family.
    LolC/E subfamily.
Complete proteome; Inner membrane; Membrane; Transmembrane; Transport.
