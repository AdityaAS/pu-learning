-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for glutamate. L-glutamate acts as an
    excitatory neurotransmitter at many synapses in the central
    nervous system. The postsynaptic actions of Glu are mediated by a
    variety of receptors that are named according to their selective
    agonists. This receptor binds AMPA(quisqualate) > glutamate >
    kainate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PRKCABP, GRIP1 and GRIP2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.

    Name=Flip;

                               VSP_000118;
-!- PTM: Palmitoylated. Depalmitoylated upon glutamate stimulation.
    Cys-621 palmitoylation leads to Golgi retention and decreased cell
    surface expression. In contrast, Cys-847 palmitoylation does not
    affect cell surface expression but regulates stimulation-dependent
    endocytosis (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glutamate-gated ion channel (TC 1.A.10)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-7 is the initiator.
