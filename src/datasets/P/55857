AC   P54700;
Flagellar biosynthetic protein fliP precursor.
"The FliO, FliP, FliQ, and FliR proteins of Salmonella typhimurium:
putative components for flagellar assembly.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in the flagellum-specific transport system
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: For insertion of fliP into the membrane, cleavage
    of the signal peptide is important kinetically but not absolutely
    required.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fliP/mopC/spaP family.
