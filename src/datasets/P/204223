AC   P03705;
Holin (gpS protein) [Includes: Lysis protein S; Lysis inhibitor].
"Nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage lambda DNA.";
"Mutational analysis of bacteriophage lambda lysis gene S.";
-!- FUNCTION: The 105 AA product induces host cell lysis by causing
    formation of pores in the inner membrane. The 107 AA protein
    counteracts the formation of such tunnels.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative initiation; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Lysis inhibitor;
      IsoId=P03705-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Lysis protein S;
      IsoId=P03705-2; Sequence=VSP_018685;
