AC   Q00910;
Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2A1 (Solute
carrier family 21 member 2) (Prostaglandin transporter) (PGT) (Matrin
F/G 1).
"Molecular cloning of matrin F/G: a DNA binding protein of the nuclear
matrix that contains putative zinc finger motifs.";
"Identification and characterization of a prostaglandin transporter.";
-!- FUNCTION: May mediate the release of newly synthesized
    prostaglandins from cells, the transepithelial transport of
    prostaglandins, and the clearance of prostaglandins from the
    circulation. Transports PGD2, as well as PGE1, PGE2 and PGF2A.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the organo anion transporter (TC 2.A.60)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) thought to be a nuclear DNA-
    binding protein.
