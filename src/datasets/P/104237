AC   P0A5K9; O53898;
Large-conductance mechanosensitive channel.
"The complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium bovis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Channel that opens in response to stretch forces in the
    membrane lipid bilayer. May participate in the regulation of
    osmotic pressure changes within the cell (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homopentamer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mscL family.
