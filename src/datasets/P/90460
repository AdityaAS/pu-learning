Lysosomal-associated transmembrane protein 5 (Lysosomal-associated
multitransmembrane protein 5) (Retinoic acid-inducible E3 protein).
"LAPTM5: a novel lysosomal-associated multispanning membrane protein
preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells.";
"E3, a hematopoietic-specific transcript directly regulated by the
retinoic acid receptor alpha.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: May have a special functional role during embryogenesis
    and in adult hematopoietic cells.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds to ubiquitin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Lysosome; lysosomal membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Preferentially expressed in adult
    hematopoietic tissues. High levels in lymphoid and myeloid
    tissues.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: During embryonic development it is expressed
    in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tissues.
-!- INDUCTION: By retinoic acid. Likely target of the activated
    retinoic acid receptor alpha.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the LAPTM4/LAPTM5 transporter family.
