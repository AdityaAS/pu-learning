AC   P68706; P00844;
ATP synthase C chain (EC 3.6.3.14) (Lipid-binding protein)
(Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding protein).
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague.";
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis KIM.";
"Complete genome sequence of Yersinia pestis strain 91001, an isolate
avirulent to humans.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the three chains of the nonenzymatic
    component (CF(0) subunit) of the ATPase complex.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCDD) binding to the
    active aspartate residue inhibits ATPase in vitro (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase C chain family.
