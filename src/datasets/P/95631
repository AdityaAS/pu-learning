"Molecular analysis and spatial expression pattern of a low-
temperature-specific barley gene, blt101.";
"Identification of a novel low-temperature-response element in the
promoter of the barley (Hordeum vulgare L) gene blt101.1.";
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in shoot meristems, mature leaves
    and roots.
-!- INDUCTION: By cold shock and salt stress, but not by drought or
    abscisic acid (ABA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UPF0057 (PMP3) family.
Membrane; Transmembrane.
