AC   P46349; P94473;
GABA permease (4-amino butyrate transport carrier) (Gamma-
aminobutyrate permease).
"Expression of the Bacillus subtilis gabP gene is regulated
independently in response to nitrogen and amino acid availability.";
"The 52 degrees-55 degrees segment of the Bacillus subtilis
chromosome: a region devoted to purine uptake and metabolism, and
containing the genes cotA, gabP and guaA and the pur gene cluster
within a 34960 bp nucleotide sequence.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transporter for GABA.
