-!- FUNCTION: Forms a channel through the cell membrane that allows
    diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules. The channel adopts an
    open conformation at low or zero membrane potential and a closed
    conformation at potentials above 30-40 mV. The open state has a
    weak anion selectivity whereas the closed state is cation-
    selective. Is the major permeability fator of the mitochondrial
    outer membrane.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P25453:DMC1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-13686, EBI-5955;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane.
-!- DOMAIN: Consists mainly of membrane-spanning sided beta-sheets. 19
    strands distributed along the entire VDAC protein, have the
    potential to adopt transmembrane beta pleated sheet structures,
    which rolled together may form a "beta-barrel" type structure,
    possessing pore dimensions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eukaryotic mitochondrial porin family.
