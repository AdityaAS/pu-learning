-!- FUNCTION: Electrogenic sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter in
    exchange for intracellular chloride. Plays an important role in
    regulating intracellular pH.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Note=Localizes to the basolateral membrane (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
