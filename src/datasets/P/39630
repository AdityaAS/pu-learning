AC   Q01857;
C4-dicarboxylate transport protein.
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the transport of dicarboxylates such as
    succinate, fumarate, and malate from the periplasm across the
    inner membrane. This transport system plays an important role in
    the energy supply of rhizobium-legume symbionts (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:dicarboxylate (SDF) symporter
    (TC 2.A.23) family.
