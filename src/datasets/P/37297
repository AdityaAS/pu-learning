-!- FUNCTION: Somehow involved in the cytochrome D branch of aerobic
    respiration. Seems to be a component of a transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Required for growth at high temperatures.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MsbA subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
