AC   P0AGD8; P07019; P77007; P77008;
Signal recognition particle protein (Fifty-four homolog).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Necessary for efficient export of extracytoplasmic
    proteins. Binds to the signal sequence when it emerges from the
    ribosomes (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Signal recognition particle consists of a 4.5 RNA
    molecule and protein ffh (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The protein has a two domain structure: the G-domain binds
    GTP; the M-domain binds the RNA and also binds the signal sequence
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GTP-binding SRP family.
Complete proteome; GTP-binding; Nucleotide-binding; Ribonucleoprotein;
RNA-binding; Signal recognition particle.
