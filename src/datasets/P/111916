-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a nickel transport system, probably
    translocates nickel through the bacterial inner membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Probably forms an heterodimeric pore with nikC.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. OppBC subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
