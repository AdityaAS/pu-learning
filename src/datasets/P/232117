AC   Q62720;
Zinc transporter 1 (ZnT-1) (Solute carrier family 30 member 1).
"Cloning and functional characterization of a mammalian zinc
transporter that confers resistance to zinc.";
"Regulation of the zinc transporter ZnT-1 by dietary zinc.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in zinc transport out of the cell.
-!- SUBUNIT: Multimer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable). Note=Localized on the basolateral surface of the
    enterocytes.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. The protein is detected in
    duodenum and jejunum but not in ileum and colon.
-!- INDUCTION: Slightly by zinc in the intestine, but not the liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)
    transporter (TC 2.A.4) family. SLC30A subfamily.
