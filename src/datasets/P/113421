AC   Q8N130;
Sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2C (Sodium/phosphate
cotransporter 2C) (Na(+)/Pi cotransporter 2C) (Sodium-phosphate
transport protein 2C) (Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter 2C)
(NaPi-2c) (Sodium/inorganic phosphate cotransporter IIC) (Solute
carrier family 34 member 3).
"Growth-related renal type II Na/Pi cotransporter.";
"Complete sequencing and characterization of 21,243 full-length human
cDNAs.";
"SLC34A3 mutations in patients with hereditary hypophosphatemic
rickets with hypercalciuria predict a key role for the sodium-
phosphate cotransporter NaPi-IIc in maintaining phosphate
homeostasis.";
"Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria is caused by
mutations in the sodium-phosphate cotransporter gene SLC34A3.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in actively transporting phosphate into
    cells via Na(+) cotransport in the renal brush border membrane.
    Probably mediates 20-30% of the apical influx.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=79 uM for phosphate;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC34A3 are the cause of hereditary
    hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) [MIM:241530].
    HHRH is an autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemia
    characterized by reduced renal phosphate reabsorption and rickets.
    Increased serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D lead to increase
    in urinary calcium excretion.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: A 2:1 stoichiometry to Na(+)/Pi is observed at pH
    7.4.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC34A transporter family.
