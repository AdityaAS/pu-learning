Outer membrane lipoprotein bfpB precursor (Bundle-forming pilus B).
"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli: identification of a gene cluster
coding for bundle-forming pilus morphogenesis.";
"Complete DNA sequence and structural analysis of the enteropathogenic
Escherichia coli adherence factor plasmid.";
"BfpB, an outer membrane lipoprotein required for the biogenesis of
bundle-forming pili in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Is absolutely required for pilus biogenesis, and for
    EPEC localized adherence and autoaggregation. Acts at a step in
    the BFP biogenic pathway after production and processing of the
    structural pilus subunit bfpA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; lipid-anchor.
-!- INDUCTION: During exponential-phase growth; repressed by ammonium.
