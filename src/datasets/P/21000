2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase electron transfer component [Includes:
Ferredoxin; Ferredoxin--NAD(+) reductase (EC 1.18.1.3)].
"Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression of the plasmid-encoded
genes for the two-component 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase from
Pseudomonas cepacia 2CBS.";
"Purification and some properties of 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, a
two-component enzyme system from Pseudomonas cepacia 2CBS.";
-!- FUNCTION: Electron transfer component of 2-halobenzoate 1,2-
    dioxygenase system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Reduced ferredoxin + NAD(+) = oxidized
    ferredoxin + NADH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Xenobiotic degradation; benzoate degradation via CoA
    ligation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer. It is part of 2-halobenzoate dioxygenase two
    component enzyme system. The other component is a dioxygenase
    component consisting of 3 large (CbdA) subunits and 3 small (CbdB)
    subunits.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial ring-hydroxylating
    dioxygenase ferredoxin reductase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain.
