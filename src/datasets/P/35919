bc1 complex.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase
    complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), which is a
    respiratory chain that generates an electrochemical potential
    coupled to ATP synthesis.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 heme groups non-covalently.
-!- SUBUNIT: The bc1 complex contains 11 subunits; 3 respiratory
    subunits (cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, Rieske protein), 2 core
    proteins and 6 low-molecular weight proteins.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Heme 1 (or BL or b562) is low-potential and absorbs
    at about 562 nm, and heme 2 (or BH or b566) is high-potential and
    absorbs at about 566 nm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome b family.
