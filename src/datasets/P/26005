-!- FUNCTION: Required for effective transcriptional induction of the
    vir genes by monosaccharides in response to plant signals and for
    normal growth and chemotaxis towards certain sugars. Function as a
    periplasmic multiple sugar-binding receptor protein. It does not
    interact with a transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- INDUCTION: By L-arabinose, D-galactose, D-fucose in the presence
    of gbpR (galactose-binding protein regulator).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 2
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 212.
