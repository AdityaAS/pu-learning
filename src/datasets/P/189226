intrinsic protein) (Alpha-TIP).

the vacuolar membrane of Arabidopsis thaliana.";

thaliana.";

"From genome to function: the Arabidopsis aquaporins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Water channel required to facilitate the transport of
    water from the vacuolar compartment to the cytoplasm.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein. Note=Tonoplast. It is specifically located in
    the tonoplast of protein storage vacuoles (PSV) of the embryo and
    endosperm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominantly expressed in developing embryos
    (seeds). Also expressed in green siliques.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family. TIP
    subfamily.
