-!- FUNCTION: Required for high-affinity proline transport. May be
    responsible for proline recognition and probably also for proline
    translocation across the plasma membrane. Also function as non-
    specific GABA permease. Can also transport alanine and glycine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Requires the presence of GABA.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. YAT (TC 2.A.3.10) family.
