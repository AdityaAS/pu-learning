AC   P62967; P14512;
Tetracycline resistance protein.
"Genome-based analysis of virulence genes in a non-biofilm-forming
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (ATCC 12228).";
-!- FUNCTION: Resistance to tetracycline by an active tetracycline
    efflux. This is an energy-dependent process that decreases the
    accumulation of the antibiotic in whole cells. This protein
    functions as a metal-tetracycline/H(+) antiporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. TCR/tet
    family.
