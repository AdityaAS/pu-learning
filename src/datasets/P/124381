AC   P35763;
Perforin-1 precursor (P1) (Lymphocyte pore-forming protein)
(Cytolysin).
"Molecular cloning of rat cytolysin.";
-!- FUNCTION: In the presence of calcium, perforin polymerizes into
    transmembrane tubules and is capable of lysing non-specifically a
    variety of target cells.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic granule; cytoplasmic granule
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Note=Cytoplasmic granules
    of cytolytic T-lymphocytes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complement C6/C7/C8/C9 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 C2 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 EGF-like domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 MACPF domain.
