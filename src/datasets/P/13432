-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the chains of the nonenzymatic component
    (CF(0) subunit) of the mitochondrial ATPase complex. It has no
    apparent bacterial homolog and its exact function is unknown.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. In yeast, the
    dimeric form of ATP synthase consists of 18 polypeptides: alpha,
    beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, 4 (B), 5 (OSCP), 6 (A), 8, 9 (C), d,
    E (Tim11), f, g, h, i, j and k.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 6820 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase d subunit family.
