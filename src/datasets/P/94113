AC   P97046;
Multidrug resistance ABC transporter ATP-binding and permease protein
(EC 3.6.3.44).
"Multidrug resistance mediated by a bacterial homolog of the human
multidrug transporter MDR1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Efflux transporter for a variety of amphiphilic cationic
    compounds, including antibiotics.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + xenobiotic(In) = ADP + phosphate
    + xenobiotic(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
