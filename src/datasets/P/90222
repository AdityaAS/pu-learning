AC   P29823;
Lactose transport system permease protein lacF.
"Molecular analysis of the lac operon encoding the binding-protein-
dependent lactose transport system and beta-galactosidase in
Agrobacterium radiobacter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for lactose. Probably responsible for the translocation of the
    substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By lactose and various galactosides, and subject to
    catabolite repression by glucose, galactose and succinate. In
    strain AR50 the expression of the lac operon is constitutive.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. MalFG subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
