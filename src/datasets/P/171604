-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the efflux of sugars. The physiological role
    may be the detoxification of non-metabolizable sugar analogs. Can
    transport lactose and glucose.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Set
    transporter family.
