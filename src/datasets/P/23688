Colicin-Ia.
"DNA and amino acid sequence analysis of structural and immunity genes
of colicins Ia and Ib.";
"Nucleotide polymorphism in colicin E1 and Ia plasmids from natural
isolates of Escherichia coli.";
"Crystal structure of colicin Ia.";
-!- FUNCTION: This colicin is a channel-forming colicin. This class of
    transmembrane toxins depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane, leading
    to dissipation of cellular energy.
-!- FUNCTION: Colicins are polypeptide toxins produced by and active
    against, Escherichia coli and closely related bacteria.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the channel forming colicin family.
