AC   P32014;
Capsule polysaccharide export inner-membrane protein ctrB.
"Evidence for a common molecular origin of the capsule gene loci in
Gram-negative bacteria expressing group II capsular polysaccharides.";
"Complete genome sequence of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain
MC58.";
-!- FUNCTION: May form an ATP-driven capsule polysaccharide export
    apparatus, in association with the ctrC and ctrD proteins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bexC/ctrB/kpsE family.
