-!- FUNCTION: One gap junction consists of a cluster of closely packed
    pairs of transmembrane channels, the connexons, through which
    materials of low MW diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell.
-!- SUBUNIT: A connexon is composed of a hexamer of connexins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the connexin family. Beta-type (group I)
    subfamily.
