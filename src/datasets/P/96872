AC   P11006;
Magainins precursor [Contains: Small acidic peptide; Magainin-1
(Magainin I); Magainin-2 (Magainin II)].

isolation, characterization of two active forms, and partial cDNA
sequence of a precursor.";

-!- FUNCTION: Antimicrobial peptides that inhibit the growth of
    numerous species of bacteria and fungi and induce osmotic lysis of
    protozoa. Magainins are membrane lytic agents.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Synthesized in the stomach and stored in a
    novel granular multinucleated cell in the gastric mucosa. It is
    stored as active, processed peptides in large granules within the
    granular gland secretions of the skin.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gastrin/cholecystokinin family.
    Magainin subfamily.
