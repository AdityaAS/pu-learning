Non-classical export protein 1.
"A new pathway for protein export in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"The sequence of a 36 kb segment on the left arm of yeast chromosome X
identifies 24 open reading frames including NUC1, PRP21 (SPP91), CDC6,
CRY2, the gene for S24, a homologue to the aconitase gene ACO1 and two
homologues to chromosome III genes.";
"Complete nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
X.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a novel pathway of export of proteins that
    lack a cleavable signal sequence. May be part of the export
    machinery or may also be a substrate for non-classical export.
