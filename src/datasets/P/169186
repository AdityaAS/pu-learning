-!- FUNCTION: Essential component of the mitochondrial outer membrane
    sorting assembly machinery (SAM or TOB) complex, which is required
    for the sorting of proteins with complicated topology, such as
    beta-barrel proteins, to the mitochondrial outer membrane after
    import by the TOM complex.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the mitochondrial outer membrane sorting
    assembly machinery (SAM or TOB) complex, which at least consists
    of SAM35, SAM37 and SAM50.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1470 molecules/cell.
