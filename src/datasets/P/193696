AC   O07515;
Probable tryptophan transport protein.
"The 172 kb prkA-addAB region from 83 degrees to 97 degrees of the
Bacillus subtilis chromosome contains several dysfunctional genes, the
glyB marker, many genes encoding transporter proteins, and the
ubiquitous hit gene.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"A Bacillus subtilis gene of previously unknown function, yhaG, is
translationally regulated by tryptophan-activated TRAP and appears to
be involved in tryptophan transport.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably involved in tryptophan uptake.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Its translation is regulated by tryptophan-activated
    RNA-binding regulatory protein (TRAP).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the trpP transporter family.
