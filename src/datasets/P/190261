Translocase of chloroplast 34 (EC 3.6.5.-) (34 kDa chloroplast outer
envelope protein) (GTP-binding protein OEP34) (GTP-binding protein
IAP34).
"A constituent of the chloroplast import complex represents a new type
of GTP-binding protein.";
"Identification of two GTP-binding proteins in the chloroplast protein
import machinery.";
"Crystal structure of pea Toc34, a novel GTPase of the chloroplast
protein translocon.";
-!- FUNCTION: GTPase involved in protein precursor import into
    chloroplasts. Seems to recognize chloroplast-destined precursor
    proteins and regulate their presentation to the translocation
    channel through GTP hydrolysis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer and monomer. Part of the TOC core complex that
    includes a protein for the specific recognition of transit
    peptides surrounded by a ring composed of four proteins forming
    translocation channels, and four to five GTP-binding proteins
    providing energy. This core complex can interact with components
    of the TIC complex to form a larger import complex. Chloroplastic
    protein precursor such as prSS (precursor of the RuBisCO small
    subunit) interacts with these complexes. The TOC complex contains
    a specific subset of polar lipids such as
    digalactosyldiacylglyceride (DGDG), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and
    phosphatidylglycerol (PG). TOC34 interacts at least with TOC75.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q9MUK5:toc64; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-638506, EBI-638487;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast outer
    membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TOC34 family.
