Biotin sulfoxide reductase (EC 1.-.-.-) (BDS reductase) (BSO
reductase).
"Cloning and nucleotide sequence of bisC, the structural gene for
biotin sulfoxide reductase in Escherichia coli.";
"Analysis of the Escherichia coli genome. V. DNA sequence of the
region from 76.0 to 81.5 minutes.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
-!- FUNCTION: This enzyme may serve as a scavenger, allowing the cell
    to utilize biotin sulfoxide as a biotin source. It reduces a
    spontaneous oxidation product of biotin, D-biotin D-sulfoxide (BSO
    or BDS), back to biotin.
-!- COFACTOR: Molybdenum (molybdopterin).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Requires a small thioredoxin-like protein for
    activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family.
Complete proteome; Molybdenum; Oxidoreductase.
