AC   P35526;
Chloride intracellular channel protein 5 (Chlorine channel protein
p64).
"Molecular cloning and characterization of p64, a chloride channel
protein from kidney microsomes.";
"A 29 kDa intracellular chloride channel p64H1 is associated with
large dense-core vesicles in rat hippocampal neurons.";
-!- FUNCTION: Voltage-gated chloride channel which mediates the
    control of membrane potential and the regulation of
    transepithelial ion absorption and secretion.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Note=Intracellular organelles.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in most tissues. Higher levels found
    in kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, T84 and PANC-1 cells.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chloride channel CLIC family.
