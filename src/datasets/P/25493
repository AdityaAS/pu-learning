Nitrate/chlorate transporter.
"The herbicide sensitivity gene CHL1 of Arabidopsis encodes a nitrate-
inducible nitrate transporter.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in proton-dependent nitrate uptake.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found predominantly in roots.
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrate.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: When mutated confers resistance to the herbicide
    chlorate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PTR2/POT transporter (TC 2.A.17)
    family.
