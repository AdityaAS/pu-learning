Holin-like protein cidA.
"Whole genome sequencing of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Increases the activity of extracellular murein
    hydrolases possibly by mediating their export via hole formation.
    Inhibited by the antiholin-like proteins lrgAB. In an unstressed
    cell, the lrgAB products probably inhibit the function of the
    cidAB proteins. When a cell is stressed by the addition of
    antibiotics or by other factors in the environment, the cidAB
    proteins possibly oligomerize within the bacterial cell membrane,
    creating lesions that disrupt the proton motive force, which in
    turn results in loss of cell viability. These lesions are also
    hypothesized to regulate the subsequent cell lysis by either
    allowing the murein hydrolases access to the cell wall substrate
    and/or regulating their activity by a possible change in the cell
    wall pH that results from loss of membrane potential (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cidA/lrgA family. CidA subfamily.
