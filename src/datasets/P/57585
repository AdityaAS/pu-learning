-!- FUNCTION: DNA motor protein, which is both required to move DNA
    out of the region of the septum during cell division and for the
    septum formation. Tracks DNA in an ATP-dependent manner by
    generating positive supercoils in front of it and negative
    supercoils behind it.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homohexamer. This suggests the formation of a ring
    between the two cells at the septum that surrounds DNA (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Note=Located at the septum. The large C-terminal part of the
    protein is cytoplasmic (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 FtsK domain.
