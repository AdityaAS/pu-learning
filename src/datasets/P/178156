-!- FUNCTION: High affinity uptake of sulfate into the cell.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC26A/SulP transporter (TC 2.A.53)
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 STAS domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.4 (CAA84506) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 488.
