AC   P48995;
Short transient receptor potential channel 1 (TrpC1) (TRP-1 protein).
"Molecular cloning of a widely expressed human homologue for the
Drosophila trp gene.";
"TRPC1, a human homolog of a Drosophila store-operated channel.";
"Cloning and functional expression of a human Ca2+-permeable cation
channel activated by calcium store depletion.";
"Assembly of Trp1 in a signaling complex associated with caveolin-
scaffolding lipid raft domains.";
"TrpC1 is a membrane-spanning subunit of store-operated Ca(2+)
channels in native vascular smooth muscle cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Thought to form a receptor-activated non-selective
    calcium permeant cation channel. Probably is operated by a
    phosphatidylinositol second messenger system activated by receptor
    tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors. Seems to be also
    activated by intracellular calcium store depletion.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with TRPC3. Interacts with ITPR3.
-!- INTERACTION:

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Seems to be ubiquitous.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. STrpC
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 ANK repeats.
