AC   P31637;
Sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter (Na(+)/myo-inositol cotransporter).
"Cloning of the cDNA for a Na+/myo-inositol cotransporter, a
hypertonicity stress protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Prevents intracellular accumulation of high
    concentrations of myo-inositol (an osmolyte) that result in
    impairment of cellular function.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain and kidney.
-!- INDUCTION: Medium hypertonicity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:solute symporter (SSF)
    (TC 2.A.21) family.
