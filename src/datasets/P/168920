AC   P48065;
Sodium- and chloride-dependent betaine transporter (Na+/Cl-
betaine/GABA transporter) (BGT-1).
"Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a GABA/betaine
transporter from human kidney.";
"Cloning and expression of a betaine/GABA transporter from human
brain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transports betaine and GABA. May have a role in
    regulation of GABAergic transmission in the brain through the
    reuptake of GABA into presynaptic terminals, as well as in osmotic
    regulation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with LIN7C (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Liver, heart, skeletal muscle, placenta, and a
    widespread distribution in the brain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
