Aquaporin-9 (AQP-9).
"Molecular characterization of a broad selectivity neutral solute
channel.";
"Cloning and functional expression of rAQP9L a new member of aquaporin
family from rat liver.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Forms a channel with a broad specificity. Mediates
    passage of a wide variety of non-charged solutes including
    carbamides, polyols, purines, and pyrimidines in a phloretin- and
    mercury-sensitive manner, whereas amino acids, cyclic sugars,
    Na(+), K(+), Cl(-), and deprotonated monocarboxylates are
    excluded. Also permeable to urea but not to glycerol.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
