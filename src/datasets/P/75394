AC   Q86LR2;
Hydralysin-1.
"Hydralysin, a novel animal group-selective paralytic and cytolytic
protein from a noncnidocystic origin in hydra.";
"Hydralysins, a new category of beta-pore-forming toxins in
cnidaria.";
-!- FUNCTION: Induces an immediate fast muscle contraction followed by
    flaccid paralysis when injected into blowfly larvae. The paralytic
    effect is lower in mice and fish. Has strong cytolytic activity
    against insect Sf9 cells and human HeLa cells, weak activity
    against human JAR cells, and no activity against human HEK293
    cells. Binds to erythrocyte membranes and has weak hemolytic
    activity, probably mediated by oligomerization and pore formation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found in whole body extract but not in the
    cnidocyst.
-!- TOXIC DOSE: PD(50) is 0.36 mg/kg by injection in blowfly larvae,
    in Ref.1.
-!- TOXIC DOSE: PD(50) is 0.557 mg/kg by injection in blowfly larvae,
    in Ref.2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hydralysin family.
