-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the uptake of L-fucose across the boundary
    membrane with the concomitant transport of protons into the cell
    (symport system). Can also transport L-galactose and D-arabinose,
    but at reduced rates compared with L-fucose. Is not able to
    transport L-rhamnose and L-arabinose.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By L-fucose.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. FHS
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.7) family.
