AC   P02915;
Histidine transport ATP-binding protein hisP.
"Complete nucleotide sequence and identification of membrane
components of the histidine transport operon of S. typhimurium.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Crystal structure of the ATP-binding subunit of an ABC transporter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for histidine. Probably responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
