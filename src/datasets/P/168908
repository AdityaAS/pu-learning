AC   Q9H9S3;
Protein transport protein Sec61 subunit alpha isoform 2 (Sec61 alpha-
2).
"Sec61 alpha isoforms.";
"Complete sequencing and characterization of 21,243 full-length human
cDNAs.";
-!- FUNCTION: Appears to play a crucial role in the insertion of
    secretory and membrane polypeptides into the ER. It is required
    for assembly of membrane and secretory proteins. Found to be
    tightly associated with membrane-bound ribosomes, either directly
    or through adaptor proteins (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimeric complex composed of SEC61-alpha, SEC61-
    beta and SEC61-gamma (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q9H9S3-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q9H9S3-2; Sequence=VSP_010472;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secY/SEC61-alpha family.
