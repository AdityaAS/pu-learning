AC   O30417;
Glutamate/gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter.
"A chloride-inducible acid resistance mechanism in Lactococcus lactis
and its regulation.";
"Identification of a sodium chloride-regulated promoter in Lactococcus
lactis by single-copy chromosomal fusion with a reporter gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in glutamate-dependent acid resistance. May be
    involved in antiport of glutamate and glutamate-gamma-
    aminobutyrate (GABA).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Expression is highest at onset of stationary phase in
    presence of NaCl and glutamate, and at low pH. Chloride-dependent
    expression is activated by gadR.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. Glutamate:GABA antiporter (GGA) (TC 2.A.3.7) family.
