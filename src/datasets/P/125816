AC   Q52982;
Probable K(+)/H(+) antiporter subunit E (pH adaptation potassium
efflux system protein E) (Pha system subunit E).
"The pha gene cluster of Rhizobium meliloti involved in pH adaptation
and symbiosis encodes a novel type of K+ efflux system.";
"Analysis of the chromosome sequence of the legume symbiont
Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a K(+) efflux system which is required for the
    adaptation of R.meliloti to alkaline pH as well as for the
    infection process during symbiotic nodule development.
-!- SUBUNIT: May form a hetero-oligomeric complex that consists of six
    subunits: phaAB, phaC, phaD, phaE, phaF and phaG.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CPA3 antiporters (TC 2.A.63) subunit E
    family.
