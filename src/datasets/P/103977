Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (ATP-binding cassette sub-
family C member 4) (MRP/cMOAT-related ABC transporter) (Multi-specific
organic anion transporter-B) (MOAT-B).
"Isolation of MOAT-B, a widely expressed multidrug resistance-
associated protein/canalicular multispecific organic anion
transporter-related transporter.";
"Analysis of expression of cMOAT (MRP2), MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5,
homologues of the multidrug resistance-associated protein gene (MRP1),
in human cancer cell lines.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be an organic anion pump relevant to cellular
    detoxification.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed, with particularly high
    levels in prostate, but is barely detectable in liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Conjugate
    transporter (TC 3.A.1.208) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transmembrane type-1 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
