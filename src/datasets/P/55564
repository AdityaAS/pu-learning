AC   P40729;
Flagellar biosynthesis protein flhA.
"Molecular characterization of the Salmonella typhimurium flhB operon
and its protein products.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for formation of the rod structure of the
    flagellar apparatus. Together with fliI and fliH, may constitute
    the export apparatus of flagellin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FHIPEP (flagella/HR/invasion proteins
    export pore) family.
