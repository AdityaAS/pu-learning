AC   P15701;
2-keto-3-deoxygluconate permease (KDG permease).
"Nucleotide sequence of the Erwinia chrysanthemi gene encoding 2-keto-
3-deoxygluconate permease.";
-!- FUNCTION: The 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate permease transports the
    degraded pectin products into the bacterial cell, where they serve
    as carbon and energy sources. This is a hydrogen coupled transport
    system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the kdgT transporter family.
