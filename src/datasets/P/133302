AC   P16033;
Photosystem Q(B) protein (32 kDa thylakoid membrane protein)
(Photosystem II protein D1).
"Nucleotide sequence of the psbA3 gene from the cyanobacterium
Synechocystis PCC 6803.";
"Nucleotide sequence of a second psbA gene from the unicellular
cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803.";
"Sequence analysis of the genome of the unicellular cyanobacterium
Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. II. Sequence determination of the
entire genome and assignment of potential protein-coding regions.";
"Mutations in the D1 subunit of photosystem II distinguish between
quinone and herbicide binding sites.";
"The D-E region of the D1 protein is involved in multiple quinone and
herbicide interactions in photosystem II.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the two reaction center proteins of the
    photosystem II.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cellular thylakoid membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Herbicides such as atrazine, BNT, diuron or ioxynil
    bind to Q(B) and blocks the electron transport.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Cyanobacteria are generally known to contain 2 to 3
    copies of the psbA gene.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the reaction center pufL/M/psbA/D family.
