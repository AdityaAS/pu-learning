AC   P47862;
Aquaporin-3 (AQP-3) (31.4 kDa water channel protein).
"Cloning and expression of AQP3, a water channel from the medullary
collecting duct of rat kidney.";
"Molecular cloning and expression of a member of the aquaporin family
with permeability to glycerol and urea in addition to water expressed
at the basolateral membrane of kidney collecting duct cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Forms a water-specific channel that provide kidney
    medullary collecting duct with high permeability to water, thereby
    permitting water to move in the direction of an osmotic gradient.
    May function as a water and urea exit mechanism in antidiuresis in
    collecting duct cells. Also slightly permeable to urea and
    glycerol. It may play an important role in gastrointestinal tract
    water transport and in glycerol metabolism.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Renal medulla and colon. Predominantly in the
    inner medulla.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
