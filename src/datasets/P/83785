Inward rectifier potassium channel 2 (Potassium channel, inwardly
rectifying subfamily J member 2) (Inward rectifier K(+) channel
Kir2.1) (Cardiac inward rectifier potassium channel) (IRK1).
"Inwardly rectifying potassium channels in lens epithelium are from
the IRK1 (Kir 2.1) family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably participates in establishing action potential
    waveform and excitability of neuronal and muscle tissues. Inward
    rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater
    tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out
    of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration
    of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the
    voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive
    voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage
    of outward current by internal magnesium. Can be blocked by
    extracellular barium or cesium.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homomultimeric and heteromultimeric association with
    Kir2.3, resulting in an enhanced G-protein-induced current.
    Association, via its PDZ-recognition domain, with LIN7A, LIN7B,
    LIN7C, DLG1, CASK and APBA1 plays a key role in its localization
    and trafficking (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the inward rectifier-type potassium channel
    family.
