Transcriptional regulator nadR.
"Regulation of NAD metabolism in Salmonella typhimurium: molecular
sequence analysis of the bifunctional nadR regulator and the nadA-pnuC
operon.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"The nadI region of Salmonella typhimurium encodes a bifunctional
regulatory protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: NadR is bifunctional; it interacts with pnuC at low
    internal NAD levels, permitting transport of NMN intact into the
    cell. As NAD levels increase within the cell, the affinity of nadR
    for the operator regions of nadA, nadB, and pncB increases,
    repressing the transcription of these genes.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; peripheral membrane protein.
    Cytoplasm. Note=May loosely associate with the membrane through
    its interaction with the membrane-bound pnuC. In combination with
    corepressor (NAD?), the cytoplasmic form of nadR would be capable
    of acting as a transcriptional repressor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HTH cro/C1-type DNA-binding domain.
