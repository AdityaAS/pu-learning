AC   P05529;
Protein mcbF.
"The export of the DNA replication inhibitor Microcin B17 provides
immunity for the host cell.";
-!- FUNCTION: Together with two further proteins mcbE and mcbG this
    protein causes immunity to the peptide antibiotic microcin B17,
    which inhibits DNA replication in enterobacteriaceae. Immunity is
    determined by two different mechanisms. McbE is involved in the
    production of extracellular MccB17 and, in a complex with mcbf it
    also serves as "pump" for the export of active MccB17 from the
    cytoplasm to the periplasmic space.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
Antibiotic resistance; ATP-binding; Nucleotide-binding; Plasmid;
