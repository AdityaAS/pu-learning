-!- FUNCTION: Transporter for alanine, serine, cysteine, and
    threonine. Exhibits sodium dependence.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed mostly in brain, muscle, and
    pancreas but detected in all tissues examined.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:dicarboxylate (SDF) symporter
    (TC 2.A.23) family.
