Mitochondrial 2-oxodicarboxylate carrier 2.
"Sequence and analysis of a 33 kb fragment from the right arm of
chromosome XV of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XV.";
"Identification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae of two isoforms of a novel
mitochondrial transporter for 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transports C5-C7 oxodicarboxylates across the inner
    membranes of mitochondria. Can transport 2-oxoadipate, 2-
    oxoglutarate, adipate, glutarate, 2-oxopimelate, oxaloacetate,
    citrate and malate. The main physiological role is probably to
    supply 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate from the mitochondrial
    matrix to the cytosol where they are used in the biosynthesis of
    lysine and glutamate, respectively, and in lysine catabolism.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
