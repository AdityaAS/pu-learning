-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the transport of acylcarnitines of different
    length across the mitochondrial inner membrane from the cytosol to
    the mitochondrial matrix for their oxidation by the mitochondrial
    fatty acid-oxidation pathway.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC25A20 are the cause of carnitine-
    acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACT deficiency)
    [MIM:212138]. It is an autosomal recessive deficiency in
    mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids. It is usually lethal
    within a few hours or days after birth. Symptoms characterizing
    its normally severe clinical phenotype include fatty hepatomegaly
    with abnormal liver function, cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness and
    episodes of life-threatening coma, which eventually lead to death.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
