-!- FUNCTION: Constitutively active calcium selective cation channel
    thought to be involved in Ca(2+) reabsorption in kidney and
    intestine. The channel is activated by low internal calcium level
    and the current exhibits an inward rectification. A Ca(2+)-
    dependent feedback regulation includes fast channel inactivation
    and slow current decay. Heteromeric assembly with TRPV6 seems to
    modify channel properties. TRPV5-TRPV6 heteromultimeric
    concatemers exhibit voltage-dependent gating (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer and probably heterotetramer with TRPV6.
    Interacts with TRPV6. Interacts with S100A10 and probably with the
    ANAX2-S100A10 heterotetramer. The interaction with S100A10 is
    required for the trafficking to the plasma membrane. Interacts
    with calmodulin. Interacts with BSPRY, which results in its
    inactivation (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; apical cell membrane; multi-
    pass membrane protein (By similarity). Note=Colocalized with
    S100A10 and ANAX2 along the apical domain of kidney distal tubular
    cells (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed at high levels in kidney, small
    intestine and pancreas, and at lower levels in testis, prostate,
    placenta, brain, colon and rectum.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. TrpV
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 ANK repeats.
