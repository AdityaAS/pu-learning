flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably part of the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system yecCS for an amino acid; probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrate across the membrane (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. HisMQ subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
