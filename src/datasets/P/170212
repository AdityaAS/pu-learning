"Plasmid-mediated sucrose metabolism in Escherichia coli:
characterization of scrY, the structural gene for a
phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system outer
membrane porin.";
"A sugar-specific porin, ScrY, is involved in sucrose uptake in
enteric bacteria.";
"Structure of the sucrose-specific porin ScrY from Salmonella
