0-2.4 min region.";

MG1655 and W3110.";
"Identification of an ancillary protein, YabF, required for activity
of the KefC glutathione-gated potassium efflux system in Escherichia
coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for full activity of kefC.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: It is unlikely that kefF has oxidoreductase
    activity, it has probably evolved from its function as
    oxidoreductase to be regulator of kefC.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) family.
    KefF subfamily.
 GO:0006813; P:potassium ion transport; IEA:HAMAP.
