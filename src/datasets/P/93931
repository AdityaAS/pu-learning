"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is a component of the leucine, isoleucine,
    valine, (threonine) transport system, which is one of the two
    periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport systems of the
    high-affinity transport of the branched-chain amino acids (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the leucine-binding protein family.
