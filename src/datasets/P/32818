AC   P22152;
Nitrate transporter (Nitrate permease).
"crnA encodes a nitrate transporter in Aspergillus nidulans.";
"Molecular biology of a family of nitrate and nitrite transporters
found in bacteria, fungi and plants.";
-!- FUNCTION: Permease for nitrate uptake.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Subject to nitrate and nitrite induction, and nitrogen
    metabolite repression. CrnA expression is mediated by the products
    of nirA, areA, and niaD.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.
