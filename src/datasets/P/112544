Nopaline transport system permease protein nocM.
"Opine transport genes in the octopine (occ) and nopaline (noc)
catabolic regions in Ti plasmids of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.";
"The genome of the natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens
C58.";
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen and biotechnology agent
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the nopaline active transport system
    probably consisting of four subunits: Q, M, P and T. This system
    is also capable of transporting octopine provided that catabolic
    functions are induced with nopaline.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. HisMQ subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
