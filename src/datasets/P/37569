(Sulfate-transporting ATPase).
"Deciphering the biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the
complete genome sequence.";
"Whole-genome comparison of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical and
laboratory strains.";
"Functional genomics reveals the sole sulphate transporter of the
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and its relevance to the
acquisition of sulphur in vivo.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex cysAWTP involved in
    sulfate import. Responsible for energy coupling to the transport
    system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + sulfate(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    sulfate(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (cysA), two transmembrane proteins (cysT and cysW) and a solute-
    binding protein (cysP) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
    Sulfate/tungstate importer (TC 3.A.1.6) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
