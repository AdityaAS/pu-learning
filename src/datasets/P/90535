Alpha-latrotoxin precursor (Alpha-LTX).
"Cloning and structure of cDNA encoding alpha-latrotoxin from black
widow spider venom.";
"Alpha-latrotoxin action probed with recombinant toxin: receptors
recruit alpha-latrotoxin but do not transduce an exocytotic signal.";
"Structure of tryptic fragments of a neurotoxin from black widow
spider venom.";
"Tetramerisation of alpha-latrotoxin by divalent cations is
responsible for toxin-induced non-vesicular release and contributes to
the Ca(2+)-dependent vesicular exocytosis from synaptosomes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to high-affinity receptors that are localized in
    the presynaptic plasma membrane of the nerve terminal. Binding of
    toxin results in calcium influx into nerve terminals, activation
    of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and ATP depletion. May act by
    forming cation-permeable pore-like tetramers that permeabilize the
    cell membrane and cause both neurotransmitter release and non
    vesicular leakage. Binding to receptors and activation of
    phospholipase C is not sufficient to trigger neurotransmitter
    release.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer; Homotetramerization is triggered by calcium
    and is responsible for non-vesicular release and calcium-dependent
    vesicular exocytosis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- PTM: Alpha-latrotoxin is probably processed at its C-terminus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the latrotoxin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 21 ANK repeats.
