AC   P20648; O00738;
Potassium-transporting ATPase alpha chain 1 (EC 3.6.3.10) (Proton
pump) (Gastric H+/K+ ATPase subunit alpha).
"Human gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase gene. Similarity to (Na+ + K+)-ATPase
genes in exon/intron organization but difference in control region.";
"Structure of the human gastric H,K-ATPase gene and comparison of the
5'-flanking sequences of the human and rat genes.";
"The DNA sequence and biology of human chromosome 19.";
"The family of human Na+,K+-ATPase genes. No less than five genes
and/or pseudogenes related to the alpha-subunit.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the
    exchange of H(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane.
    Responsible for acid production in the stomach.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) + K(+)(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + H(+)(Out) + K(+)(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of two subunits: alpha (catalytic) and beta.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found in gastric mucosa.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IIC subfamily.
