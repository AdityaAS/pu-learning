AC   P28570;
Sodium- and chloride-dependent creatine transporter 1 (CT1) (Creatine
transporter 1) (CHOT1) (Solute carrier family 6 member 8).
"Primary structure and functional expression of a choline transporter
expressed in the rat nervous system.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the uptake of creatine. Plays an important
    role in supplying creatine to the brain via the blood-brain
    barrier (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in brain, cerebellum, spinal cord,
    to a lesser extent, heart, but only very low expression in lung,
    kidney, and muscle.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: This protein was initially reported to be a choline
    transporter (Ref.1), but is a creatine transporter.
