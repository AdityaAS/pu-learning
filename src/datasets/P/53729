-!- FUNCTION: FecA is the outer membrane receptor protein in the
    Fe(3+) dicitrate transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- INDUCTION: For induction, the tonB and the exbB proteins have to
    be active. Regulation by the iron level mediated by the fur
    protein and induction by citrate plus iron suggest that the Fe(3+)
    dicitrate complex must enter the periplasm where it binds to a
    transmembrane protein, which regulates transcription of the fec
    genes directly or via a further inductor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tonB-dependent receptor family.
