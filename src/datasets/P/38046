AC   P13512; Q58AM2;
Cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein czcD (Cation efflux system
protein czcD).
"Expression and nucleotide sequence of a plasmid-determined divalent
cation efflux system from Alcaligenes eutrophus.";
"Two-component regulatory system involved in transcriptional control
of heavy-metal homoeostasis in Alcaligenes eutrophus.";
"Sequence and features of the Ralstonia metallidurans CH34 heavy
metals plasmids pMOL28 and pMOL30.";
"Complete sequence of plasmid pMOL30 of Ralstonia metallidurans
CH34.";
-!- FUNCTION: Necessary for activation of the czc determinant; may
    function as a membrane-bound sensor protein or as a metal ion
    transporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Most highly expressed when the upstream czcCBA
    transcript is not induced.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)
    transporter (TC 2.A.4) family. SLC30A subfamily.
