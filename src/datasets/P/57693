AC   P0ABG5; P16457;
Cell division protein ftsW.
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a septum-peptidoglycan biosynthetic protein,
    involved in cell wall formation. Plays a role in the stabilization
    of the ftsZ ring during cell division (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ftsW/rodA/spoVE family.
