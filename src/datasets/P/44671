Dipeptide transport ATP-binding protein dppD.
"A Bacillus subtilis dipeptide transport system expressed early during
sporulation.";
"Sequence of the Bacillus subtilis genome between xlyA and ykoR.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for dipeptides. Probably responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system. Expressed to facilitate adaptation to nutrient
    deficiency conditions, which also induce sporulation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
