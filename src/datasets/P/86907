AC   O95279;
Potassium channel subfamily K member 5 (Acid-sensitive potassium
channel protein TASK-2) (TWIK-related acid-sensitive K(+) channel 2).
"Cloning and expression of a novel pH-sensitive two pore domain K+
channel from human kidney.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Extracellular conserved cysteine forms an intersubunit disulphide
bridge in the KCNK5 (TASK-2) K+ channel without having an essential
effect upon activity.";
-!- FUNCTION: pH-dependent, voltage insensitive, outwardly rectifying
    potassium channel. Outward rectification is lost at high external
    K(+) concentrations.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer; disulfide-linked.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Abundant expression in kidney, also detected
    in liver, placenta and small intestine. In the kidney, expression
    is restricted to the distal tubules and collecting ducts. Not
    expressed in proximal tubules or glomeruli.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibited by quinine, quinidine and external
    acidification.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the two pore domain potassium channel
    (TC 1.A.1.8) family.
