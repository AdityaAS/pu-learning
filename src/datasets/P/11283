AC   Q9KJC2;
Antibiotic efflux pump membrane transporter arpB.
"Identification and molecular characterization of an efflux system
involved in Pseudomonas putida S12 multidrug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: The inner membrane transporter component of an
    antibiotic efflux pump. Confers resistance to numerous
    structurally unrelated antibiotics such as carbenicillin,
    chloramphenicol, erythromycin, novobiocin, streptomycin and
    tetracycline. Is not involved in organic solvent efflux.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: The arpABC operon was not seen to be induced by
    carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin nor by hexane,
    toluene or p-xylene.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acrB/acrD/acrF (TC 2.A.6) family.
-!- CAUTION: Despite being nearly identical to the ttgABC operon in
    strain DOT-T1E and the mepABC operon in strain KT2442-TOL this
    operon does not function in solvent efflux. This may be due to
    different protein expression levels. In strain KT2440 the
    equivalent operon does not seem to function in toluene efflux.
