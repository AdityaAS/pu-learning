Probable aquaporin aqpM.
"The complete genome sequence of the hyperthermophilic, sulphate-
reducing archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Channel that permits osmotically driven movement of
    water in both directions (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
