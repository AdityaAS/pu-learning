-!- FUNCTION: Provides the rickettsial cell with host ATP in exchange
    for rickettsial ADP. This is an obligate exchange system. This
    energy acquiring activity is an important component of rickettsial
    parasitism.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ADP/ATP translocase tlc family.
