Innexin unc-7 (Uncoordinated protein 7).
"Molecular and genetic analysis of unc-7, a Caenorhabditis elegans
gene required for coordinated locomotion.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Structural components of the gap junctions. Required for
    coordinated locomotion.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooligomer of unc-7 and unc-9 (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Present in all developmental stages but most
    abundant in L1-L3 larvae.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pannexin family.
