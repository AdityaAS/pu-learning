endotoxin CryIIIA(a)) (Crystaline entomocidal protoxin) (73 kDa
crystal protein).
"Isolation and characterization of EG2158, a new strain of Bacillus
thuringiensis toxic to coleopteran larvae, and nucleotide sequence of
the toxin gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Promotes colloidosmotic lysis by binding to the midgut
    epithelial cells of Coleoptera.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: The crystal protein is produced during
    sporulation and is accumulated both as an inclusion and as part of
    the spore coat.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Toxic segment of the protein is located in the N-
    terminus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the delta endotoxin family.
