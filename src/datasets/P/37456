-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex is the component
    of the aerobic respiratory chain that predominates when cells are
    grown at high aeration (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Ubiquinol-8 + O(2) = Ubiquinone-8 + H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooctamer of two A chains, two B chains, two C chains
    and two D chains (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 family.
