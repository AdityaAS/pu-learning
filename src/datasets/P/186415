Tellurite resistance protein tehA.
"Nucleotide sequence and overexpression of the tellurite-resistance
determinant from the IncHII plasmid pHH1508a.";
"A 570-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 28.0-40.1 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Location of a potassium tellurite resistance operon (tehA tehB)
within the terminus of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for potassium tellurite resistance when
    present in high copy number, probably by increasing the reduction
    rate of tellurite to metallic tellurium within the bacterium.
    Otherwise, phenotypically silent.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) thought to be plasmid encoded.
