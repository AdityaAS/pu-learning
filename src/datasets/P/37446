AC   P0ABI9; P18401;
Ubiquinol oxidase subunit 1 (EC 1.10.3.-) (Ubiquinol oxidase
polypeptide I) (Cytochrome o subunit 1) (Oxidase BO(3) subunit 1)
(Cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit 1) (Ubiquinol oxidase chain
A).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex is the component
    of the aerobic respiratory chain that predominates when cells are
    grown at high aeration. This ubiquinol oxidase shows proton pump
    activity across the membrane in addition to the electron transfer
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Ubiquinol-8 + O(2) = Ubiquinone-8 + H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 copper ion (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 protoheme IX (heme b55 and b562) groups (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooctamer of two A chains, two B chains, two C chains
    and two D chains (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Ubiquinol oxidase catalyzes the terminal step in
    the electron transport chain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the heme-copper respiratory oxidase family.
