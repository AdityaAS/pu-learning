Mastoparan-L.
"A new mast cell degranulating peptide 'mastoparan' in the venom of
Vespula lewisii.";
"Interaction of mastoparan with membranes studied by 1H-NMR
spectroscopy in detergent micelles and by solid-state 2H-NMR and 15N-
NMR spectroscopy in oriented lipid bilayers.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mast cell degranulating peptide. Activates G proteins
    that couple to phospholipase C. May be able to switch from an in-
    plane to a transmembrane orientation in lipid bilayers.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MCD family. Mastoparan subfamily.
