Gamma-hemolysin component A precursor (H-gamma-2) (H-gamma-II).
"Whole genome sequencing of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Toxin that seems to act by forming pores in the membrane
    of the cell. Has a hemolytic and a leucotoxic activity (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Toxicity requires sequential binding and synergistic
    association of a class S and a class F component which form
    heterooligomeric complexes. HlgA (class S) associates with hlgB
    (class F) thus forming an AB toxin in strains producing both
    gamma-hemolysins and leukocidins. HlgA and lukF-PV can also form a
    complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aerolysin family.
