AC   Q12300;
High-affinity glucose transporter RGT2.
"Analysis of a 26,756 bp segment from the left arm of yeast chromosome
IV.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IV.";
"Two glucose transporters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are glucose
sensors that generate a signal for induction of gene expression.";
"A global topology map of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Low-affinity glucose transporter. Can function as a
    sensor that generates an intracellular signal in the presence of
    high level of glucose. Required for maximal expression of the high
    glucose-induced HXT1 protein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
