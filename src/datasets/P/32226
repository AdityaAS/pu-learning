Caerin-1.1 [Contains: Caerin-1.1.1; Caerin-1.1.2].
"Peptides from Australian frogs. Structures of the caerins and
caeridin 1 from Litoria splendida.";
"The solution structure and activity of caerin 1.1, an antimicrobial
peptide from the Australian green tree frog, Litoria splendida.";
-!- FUNCTION: Antibacterial and antiviral peptides that adopt an alpha
    helical conformation which can disrupt bacterial membranes. Each
    caerin displays a different antimicrobial specificity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the skin parotoid and/or rostral
    glands.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains two amphipathic alpha helix regions separated by
    a region of less-defined helicity and greater flexibility.
-!- PTM: The major product is Caerin-1.1; in addition, different
    peptides are produced that are missing some amino acid residues at
    the N-terminus. Caerin-1.1.1 is inactive.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2582; METHOD=FAB; RANGE=1-25; NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2412; METHOD=FAB; RANGE=3-25; NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2299; METHOD=FAB; RANGE=4-25; NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the frog skin active peptide (FSAP) family.
    Caerin subfamily.
