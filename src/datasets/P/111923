Nickel import ATP-binding protein nikD (EC 3.6.3.24).
"The nik operon of Escherichia coli encodes a periplasmic binding-
protein-dependent transport system for nickel.";
"Analysis of the Escherichia coli genome. V. DNA sequence of the
region from 76.0 to 81.5 minutes.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";

-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex nikABCDE involved in
    nickel import. Responsible for energy coupling to the transport
    system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Ni(2+)(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    Ni(2+)(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins (nikD
    and nikE), two transmembrane proteins (nikB and nikC) and a
    solute-binding protein (nikA) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Nickel importer
    (TC 3.A.1.5.3) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
