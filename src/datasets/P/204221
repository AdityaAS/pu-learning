Lysis protein (Holin) (Protein rV).
"Nucleotide sequence of gene t (lysis gene) of the E. coli phage T4.";
"Bacteriophage T4 genome.";
"Receptor-recognizing proteins of T-even type bacteriophages. Constant
and hypervariable regions and an unusual case of evolution.";
"The asiA gene of bacteriophage T4 codes for the anti-sigma 70
protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: At the end of the growth cycle, phage T4 expresses two
    genes with lysis function, e and t. Nothing is known about the
    gene product of t, although it has been suggested that it acts as
    a phospholipase.
