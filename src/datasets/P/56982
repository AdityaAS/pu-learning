-!- FUNCTION: Probably involved in iron homeostasis. Anti-apoptotic
    protein which prevents mitochondrial damage and reactive oxygen
    species (ROS) production.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion. Note=Mitochondrial and
    extramitochondrial.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q16595-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q16595-2; Sequence=VSP_001576;
      Note=Not highly expressed and may be artifactual;
-!- PTM: Processed in two steps by mitochondrial processing peptidase
    (MPP). MPP first cleaves the precursor to intermediate form and
    subsequently converts the intermediate to mature size protein.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in FXN are the cause of Friedreich ataxia (FA)
    [MIM:229300]. FA is an autosomal recessive, progressive
    degenerative disease characterized by neurodegeneration and
    cardiomyopathy it is the most common inherited ataxia. The
    disorder is usually manifest before adolescence and is generally
    characterized by incoordination of limb movements, dysarthria,
    nystagmus, diminished or absent tendon reflexes, Babinski sign,
    impairment of position and vibratory senses, scoliosis, pes cavus,
    and hammer toe. In most patients, FA is due to GAA triplet repeat
    expansions in the first intron of the frataxin gene. But in some
    cases the disease is due to mutations in the coding region.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the frataxin family.
