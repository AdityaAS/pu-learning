AC   Q61420;
CMP-sialic acid transporter (CMP-Sia-Tr) (CMP-SA-Tr) (Solute carrier
family 35 member A1).
"Expression cloning of the Golgi CMP-sialic acid transporter.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Transport CMP-sialic acid from the cytosol into Golgi
    vesicles where glycosyltransferases function.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found in all the tissues examined including
    skeletal muscle, brain, heart, liver, kidney and spleen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nucleotide-sugar transporter family.
    SLC35A subfamily.
