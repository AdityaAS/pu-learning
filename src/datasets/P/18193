Vitamin B12 import ATP-binding protein btuD (EC 3.6.3.33) (Vitamin
B12-transporting ATPase).
"Nucleotide sequence of the btuCED genes involved in vitamin B12
transport in Escherichia coli and homology with components of
periplasmic-binding-protein-dependent transport systems.";
"A 570-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 28.0-40.1 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"The E. coli BtuCD structure: a framework for ABC transporter
architecture and mechanism.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex btuCDF involved in
    vitamin B12 import. Responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + vitamin B12(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + vitamin B12(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (btuD), two transmembrane proteins (btuC) and a solute-binding
    protein (btuF).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Vitamin B12
    importer (TC 3.A.1.13.1) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
