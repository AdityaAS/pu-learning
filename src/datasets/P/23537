AC   P05819;
Colicin-B.
"Nucleotide sequence of the colicin B activity gene cba: consensus
pentapeptide among TonB-dependent colicins and receptors.";
-!- FUNCTION: This colicin is a channel-forming colicin. This class of
    transmembrane toxins depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane, leading
    to dissipation of cellular energy.
-!- FUNCTION: Colicins are polypeptide toxins produced by and active
    against, Escherichia coli and closely related bacteria.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This colicin requires tonB for its uptake.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the channel forming colicin family.
