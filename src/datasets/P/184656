AC   P42954;
Teichoic acids export ATP-binding protein tagH (EC 3.6.3.40) (Teichoic
acid-transporting ATPase).
"The tagGH operon of Bacillus subtilis 168 encodes a two-component ABC
transporter involved in the metabolism of two wall teichoic acids.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex tagGH involved in
    teichoic acids export. Responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + teichoic acid(In) = ADP +
    phosphate + teichoic acid(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (tagH) and two transmembrane proteins (tagG) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Teichoic acids
    exporter (TC 3.A.1.104.1) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
