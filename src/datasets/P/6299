AC   Q51417;
Putative transporter protein amiS.
"Identification of two new genes in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa amidase
operon, encoding an ATPase (AmiB) and a putative integral membrane
protein (AmiS).";
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
"Nucleotide sequence of the aliphatic amidase regulator gene (amiR) of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Possible transporter that might be responsible for the
    adsorption of amidase substrates or release of their hydrolysis
    products. AmiB and amiS may act jointly in to a two component ABC
    transporter system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amiS/ureI family.
