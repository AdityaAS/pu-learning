Calcium-activated potassium channel subunit beta 4 (Calcium-activated
potassium channel, subfamily M subunit beta 4) (Maxi K channel subunit
beta 4) (BK channel subunit beta 4) (Slo-beta 4) (K(VCA)beta 4)
(Charybdotoxin receptor subunit beta 4) (BKbeta4).
"A novel nervous system beta subunit that downregulates human large
conductance calcium-dependent potassium channels.";
-!- FUNCTION: Regulatory subunit of the calcium activated potassium
    KCNMA1 (maxiK) channel. Modulates the calcium sensitivity and
    gating kinetics of KCNMA1, thereby contributing to KCNMA1 channel
    diversity. Decreases the gating kinetics and calcium sensitivity
    of the KCNMA1 channel, but with fast deactivation kinetics. May
    decrease KCNMA1 channel openings at low calcium concentrations but
    increases channel openings at high calcium concentrations. Makes
    KCNMA1 channel resistant to 100 nM charybdotoxin (CTX) toxin
    concentrations (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with KCNMA1 tetramer. There are probably 4
    molecules of KCMNB4 per KCNMA1 tetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Resistance to charybdotoxin (CTX) toxin is mediated by the
    extracellular domain (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated. Phosphorylation modulates its effect on
    KCNMA1 activation kinetics (By similarity).
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated. A highly glycosylated form is promoted by
    KCNMA1. Glycosylation, which is not required for the interaction
    with KCNMA1 and subcellular location, increases protection against
    charybdotoxin (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the KCNMB family.
