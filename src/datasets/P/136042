Mannose permease IID component (PTS system mannose-specific EIID
component) (EIID-Man) (EII-M-Man).
"The mannose permease of Escherichia coli consists of three different
proteins. Amino acid sequence and function in sugar transport, sugar
phosphorylation, and penetration of phage lambda DNA.";

-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in mannose transport.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIID domain, with its homologous EIIC domain, forms
    the PTS system translocation channel and contains part of its
    specific substrate-binding site.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIID domain.
