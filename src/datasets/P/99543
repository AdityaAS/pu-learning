-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for melibiose transport. It is capable of
    using hydrogen, sodium, and lithium cations as coupling cations
    for cotransport, depending on the particular sugar transported
    (symport system).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:galactoside symporter family.
