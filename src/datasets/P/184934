-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the transport of antigens from the cytoplasm
    to the endoplasmic reticulum for association with MHC class I
    molecules. Also acts as a molecular scaffold for the final stage
    of MHC class I folding, namely the binding of peptide. Nascent MHC
    class I molecules associate with TAP via tapasin. Inhibited by the
    covalent attachment of herpes simplex virus ICP47 protein, which
    blocks the peptide-binding site of TAP. Inhibited by human
    cytomegalovirus US6 glycoprotein, which binds to the lumenal side
    of the TAP complex and inhibits peptide translocation by
    specifically blocking ATP-binding to TAP1 and prevents the
    conformational rearrangement of TAP induced by peptide binding.
    Inhibited by human adenovirus E3-19K glycoprotein, which binds the
    TAP complex and acts as a tapasin inhibitor, preventing MHC class
    I/TAP association. Expression of TAP1 is down-regulated by human
    Epstein-Barr virus vIL-10 protein, thereby affecting the transport
    of peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent peptide
    loading by MHC class I molecules.
