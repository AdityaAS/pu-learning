-!- FUNCTION: After binding acetylcholine, the AChR responds by an
    extensive change in conformation that affects all subunits and
    leads to opening of an ion-conducting channel across the plasma
    membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a homo-oligomeric channel blocked by alpha-
    bungarotoxin. The structure is probably pentameric (By
    similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P05067:APP; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-79333, EBI-77613;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=54157.68; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=23-502;
    NOTE=Ref.10.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ligand-gated ionic channel (TC 1.A.9)
    family.
