AC   Q47085;
Achromobactin transport system permease protein cbrB.
"Differential expression of two siderophore-dependent iron-acquisition
pathways in Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937: characterization of a novel
ferrisiderophore permease of the ABC transporter family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    cbrABCD for uptake of the siderophore achromobactin. Probably
    responsible for the translocation of the substrate across the
    membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. FecCD subfamily.
