proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity uptake of maltose and maltotriose. Also
    transports alpha-methylglucoside, glucose and turanose but not
    melezitose or trehalose.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By maltose and maltotriose. Repressed by glucose.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 583.
