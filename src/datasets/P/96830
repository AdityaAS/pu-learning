AC   O05256;
Na(+)-malate symporter (Sodium-dependent malate transporter).
"Analysis of the Bacillus subtilis genome: cloning and nucleotide
sequence of a 62 kb region between 275 degrees (rrnB) and 284 degrees
(pai).";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Bacillus subtilis YqkI is a novel malic/Na+-lactate antiporter that
enhances growth on malate at low protonmotive force.";
"The Bacillus subtilis YufLM two-component system regulates the
expression of the malate transporters MaeN (YufR) and YflS, and is
essential for utilization of malate in minimal medium.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts as a Na(+)-malate symporter, as it catalyzes
    malate-dependent uptake of Na(+) and Na(+)-dependent uptake of
    malate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by the two-component regulatory
    system malK/malR in response to malate. The regulator malR binds
    to the promoter region of maeN.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:citrate (SCF) symporter family.
