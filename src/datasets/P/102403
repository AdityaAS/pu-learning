-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex modABC involved in
    molybdenum import. Responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + molybdate(Out) = ADP + phosphate
    + molybdate(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (modC), two transmembrane proteins (modB) and a solute-binding
    protein (modA) (Probable).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0A6F5:groL; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1120112, EBI-543750;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Molybdate
    importer (TC 3.A.1.8) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
