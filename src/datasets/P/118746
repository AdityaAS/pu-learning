AC   P46921;
Glycine betaine transport system permease protein opuAB.
"OpuA, an osmotically regulated binding protein-dependent transport
system for the osmoprotectant glycine betaine in Bacillus subtilis.";
"The 25 degrees-36 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome:
determination of the sequence of a 146 kb segment and identification
of 113 genes.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a multicomponent binding-protein-dependent
    transport system for glycine betaine; probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. CysTW subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
