membrane protein) (PMP70).

fold in human peroxisomal ATP binding cassette transporters.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable transporter. The nucleotide-binding fold acts
    as an ATP-binding subunit with ATPase activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Can form heterodimers with ABCD1/ALD and ABCD2/ALDR.
    Dimerization is necessary to form an active transporter. Interacts
    with PEX19.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P33897:ABCD1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-80992, EBI-81045;
    P40855:PEX19; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-80992, EBI-594747;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Peroxisome; peroxisomal membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in ABCD3 may be the cause of Zellweger syndrome
    type 2 (ZWS-2) [MIM:170995]. ZWS-2 is an autosomal recessive
    disorder due to defective import mechanisms for peroxisomal matrix
    enzymes. The clinical phenotype includes characteristic facies,
    progressive neurological dysfunction, liver disease and death in
    infancy.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. ALD subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
