-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for phosphonates; probably responsible for the translocation of
    the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The sequence shown is that of strain B.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (BAA14264) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 155.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (BAA14265) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 155.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (AAA97003) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 155.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (AAA97002) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 155.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.4 (AAC77065) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 155.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.4 (AAC77064) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 155.
-!- CAUTION: In strain K12 the phnE gene has an 8-bp insertion, absent
    from the strain B gene, which causes a frameshift mutation.
