AC   O07002;
Aspartate-proton symporter (L-aspartate transporter).
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Identification of the L-aspartate transporter in Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Uptake of L-aspartate with the concomitant import of a
    proton. Can also transport aspartate hydroxamate and L-glutamate
    with lower affinity and efficiency.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Allows enhanced growth with L-aspartate as a sole
    source nitrogen source.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-
    chlorophenylhydrazone and carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoro-
    methoxyphenylhydrazone.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. AGT (TC 2.A.3.11) family.
