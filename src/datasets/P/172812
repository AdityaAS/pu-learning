"Cloning and sequencing of the genes for Shiga toxin from Shigella
dysenteriae type 1.";
"Cloning and primary structure of Shigella toxin genes.";
"The primary structure of the operons coding for Shigella dysenteriae
toxin and temperature phage H30 shiga-like toxin.";
"Complete amino acid sequence of Shigella toxin B-chain. A novel
polypeptide containing 69 amino acids and one disulfide bridge.";
-!- FUNCTION: The B-chain is responsible for binding the holotoxin to
    specific receptors on the target cell surface.
-!- SUBUNIT: Shiga toxin contains a single A-chain and five copies of
    a B-chain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the slt beta family.
