-!- FUNCTION: Essential component of the PAM complex, a complex
    required for the translocation of transit peptide-containing
    proteins from the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix in
    an ATP-dependent manner. Seems to control the nucleotide-dependent
    binding of SSC1 to substrate proteins and the association of SSC1
    with TIM44.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the PAM complex, at least composed of SSC1
    (mtHsp70), MGE1, TIM44, PAM16/TIM16, PAM17 and PAM18/TIM14.
    Interacts with SSQ1.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P33203:PRP40; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-7891, EBI-701;
    P25632:RSC6; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-7891, EBI-21941;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial matrix.
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the grpE family.
