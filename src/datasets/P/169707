AC   P23975;
Sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter (Norepinephrine
transporter) (NET).
"Expression cloning of a cocaine- and antidepressant-sensitive human
noradrenaline transporter.";
"Molecular cloning and organization of the coding region of the human
norepinephrine transporter gene.";
"Functional interaction between monoamine plasma membrane transporters
and the synaptic PDZ domain-containing protein PICK1.";
"Orthostatic intolerance and tachycardia associated with
norepinephrine-transporter deficiency.";
-!- FUNCTION: Amine transporter. Terminates the action of
    noradrenaline by its high affinity sodium-dependent reuptake into
    presynaptic terminals.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PRKCABP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC6A2 are a cause of orthostatic intolerance
    (OI) [MIM:604715]. OI is a syndrome characterized by
    lightheadedness, fatigue, altered mentation and syncope. It is
    associated with postural tachycardia. Plasma norepinephrine
    concentration is abnormally high.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein is the target of psychomotor
    stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
