AC   Q9P7F9;
Copper transport protein ctr5 (Copper transporter 5).
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"Identification of a novel high affinity copper transport complex in
the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for high affinity copper (probably reduced Cu
    I) transport into the cell.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with ctr4.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By copper deprivation, and repressed by copper
    sufficiency.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC31A transporter family.
