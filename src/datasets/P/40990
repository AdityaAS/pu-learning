-!- FUNCTION: This protein is involved in the active transport of
    galactose and glucose. It plays a role in the chemotaxis towards
    the two sugars by interacting with the trg chemoreceptor.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- DOMAIN: The calcium-binding site is structurally similar to that
    of EF-hand proteins, but is in two parts, with the last calcium
    ligand provided by Glu-228.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 2
    family.
