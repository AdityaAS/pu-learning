"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the uptake of citrate in exchange to the
    efflux of succinate. Has a relatively broad specificity for C(4)-
    dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC13A transporter (TC 2.A.47) family.
    SODIT1 subfamily.
