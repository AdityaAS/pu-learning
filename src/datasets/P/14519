flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase B chain family.
