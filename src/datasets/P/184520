-!- FUNCTION: Sulfhydryl-activated toxin. Is able to lyse cholesterol
    containing membranes. Can be reversibly inactivated by oxidation.
    Cholesterol is the receptor for the binding of these toxins to
    eukaryotic cell membranes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the thiol-activated cytolysin family.
