AC   P31134;
Putrescine transport ATP-binding protein potG.
"Characteristics of the operon for a putrescine transport system that
maps at 19 minutes on the Escherichia coli chromosome.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for putrescine. Probably responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
