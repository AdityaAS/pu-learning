-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the high-affinity L-arabinose membrane
    transport system. Binds with high affinity to arabinose, but can
    also bind D-galactose (approximately 2-fold reduction) and D-
    fucose (approximately 40-fold reduction).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 2
    family.
