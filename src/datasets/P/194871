AC   Q93PU4;
Toluene efflux pump membrane transporter ttgH.
"Three efflux pumps are required to provide efficient tolerance to
toluene in Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E.";
"In vivo and in vitro evidence that TtgV is the specific regulator of
the TtgGHI multidrug and solvent efflux pump of Pseudomonas putida.";
-!- FUNCTION: The inner membrane transporter component of an organic
    solvent efflux pump. Involved in export of a number of organic
    solvents, including toluene and styrene. This is the most
    important solvent efflux pump in this strain, although it can
    export AMP and some antibiotics.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Constitutively expressed; the ttgGHI operon is further
    induced about 4-fold by toluene and styrene but not by
    antibiotics.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acrB/acrD/acrF (TC 2.A.6) family.
