Cytochrome c1, heme protein, mitochondrial precursor (Cytochrome c-1).
"Structural studies of bovine heart cytochrome c1.";
"Partial genomic sequence of the bovine cytochrome c1 gene.";
"Crystal structure of the cytochrome bc1 complex from bovine heart
mitochondria.";
"Complete structure of the 11-subunit bovine mitochondrial cytochrome
bc1 complex.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is the heme-containing component of the cytochrome
    b-c1 complex, which accepts electrons from Rieske protein and
    transfers electrons to cytochrome c in the mitochondrial
    respiratory chain.
-!- SUBUNIT: The bc1 complex contains 11 subunits; 3 respiratory
    subunits (cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, Rieske protein), 2 core
    proteins and 6 low-molecular weight proteins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial intermembrane
    space.
-!- PTM: Binds 1 heme group per subunit.
