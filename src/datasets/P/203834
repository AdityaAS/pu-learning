AC   P0A3W4; P09780;
Outer membrane lipoprotein virB7 precursor.
"Characterization of the virB operon from an Agrobacterium tumefaciens
Ti plasmid.";
"The Agrobacterium tumefaciens virB7 gene product, a proposed
component of the T-complex transport apparatus, is a membrane-
associated lipoprotein exposed at the periplasmic surface.";
"VirB7 lipoprotein is exocellular and associates with the
Agrobacterium tumefaciens T pilus.";
"Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB7 and VirB9 form a disulfide-linked
protein complex.";
-!- FUNCTION: Is essential for the biogenesis of the T-pilus, which is
    required for virulence and T-DNA transfer to plant cells. When is
    associated with virB9, might function as a nucleation center for
    recruitment of virB proteins during assembly of the T-DNA transfer
    machine.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer and heterodimer of virB7 and virB9; disulfide-
    linked.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; lipid-anchor. Note=Also
    associated with the T-pilus when is a homodimer, possibly at the
    pilus base.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Is protease-resistant.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Both virB7 lipid modification and disulfide cross-
    linking are important for T-pilus assembly.
