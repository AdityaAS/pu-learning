AC   P97521;
Mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein
(Carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase) (CAC) (Solute carrier family 25
member 20).
"The mitochondrial carnitine carrier protein: cDNA cloning, primary
structure and comparison with other mitochondrial transport
proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the transport of acylcarnitines of different
    length across the mitochondrial inner membrane from the cytosol to
    the mitochondrial matrix for their oxidation by the mitochondrial
    fatty acid-oxidation pathway.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
