-!- FUNCTION: Transports L-glutamate and also L- and D-aspartate.
    Essential for terminating the postsynaptic action of glutamate by
    rapidly removing released glutamate from the synaptic cleft. Acts
    as a symport by cotransporting sodium. Negatively regulated by
    ARL6IP5 (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with ARL6IP5/PRAF3 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in all tissues tested including
    liver, muscle, testis, ovary, retinoblastoma cell line, neurons
    and brain (in which there was dense expression in substantia
    nigra, red nucleus, hippocampus and in cerebral cortical layers).
-!- PTM: Glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:dicarboxylate (SDF) symporter
    (TC 2.A.23) family.
