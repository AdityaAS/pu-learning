AC   P45380;
Sulfate anion transporter 1 (SAT-1) (Solute carrier family 26 member
1) (Canalicular sulfate transporter) (Sulfate/carbonate antiporter).
"Functional expression cloning of the canalicular sulfate transport
system of rat hepatocytes.";
-!- FUNCTION: High affinity uptake of sulfate. Accepts oxalate, but
    not succinate as a cosubstrate.
