-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the transport of C4-dicarboxylates from
    the periplasm across the inner membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dcuA/dcuB transporter (TC 2.A.13.1)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.5 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 60.
