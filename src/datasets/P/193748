AC   Q9R186;
Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6
(TrpV6) (Epithelial calcium channel 2) (ECaC2) (Calcium transport
protein 1) (CaT1).
"Molecular cloning and characterization of a channel-like transporter
mediating intestinal calcium absorption.";
"CaT1 manifests the pore properties of the calcium-release-activated
calcium channel.";
-!- FUNCTION: Calcium selective cation channel probably involved in
    Ca(2+) uptake in various tissues, including Ca(2+) reabsorption in
    intestine. The channel is activated by low internal calcium level,
    probably including intracellular calcium store depletion, and the
    current exhibits an inward rectification. Inactivation includes
    both, a rapid Ca(2+)-dependent and a slower Ca(2+)-calmodulin-
    dependent mechanism, the latter may be regulated by
    phosphorylation. In vitro, is slowly inhibited by Mg(2+) in a
    voltage-independent manner. Heteromeric assembly with TRPV5 seems
    to modify channel properties. TRPV5-TRPV6 heteromultimeric
    concatemers exhibit voltage-dependent gating (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer and probably heterotetramer with TRPV5.
    Interacts with TRPV5. Interacts with S100A10 and probably with the
    ANAX2-S100A10 heterotetramer. The interaction with S100A10 is
    required for the trafficking to the plasma membrane. Interacts
    with calmodulin. Interacts with BSPRY (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in duodenum, proximal jejunum,
    cecum, and colon.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. TrpV
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 ANK repeats.
