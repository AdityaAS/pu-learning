AC   P21408;
Iron(III)-binding periplasmic protein precursor.
"Nucleotide sequences of the sfuA, sfuB, and sfuC genes of Serratia
marcescens suggest a periplasmic-binding-protein-dependent iron
transport mechanism.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex fbpABC
    (TC 3.A.1.10.1) involved in Fe(3+) ions import. This protein
    specifically binds Fe(3+) and is involved in its transmembrane
    transport (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (fbpC), two transmembrane proteins (fbpB) and a solute-binding
    protein (fbpA) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 1
    family.
