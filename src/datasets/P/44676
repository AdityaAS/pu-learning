AC   P26906; O34801;
Dipeptide-binding protein dppE precursor.
"A Bacillus subtilis dipeptide transport system expressed early during
sporulation.";
"Sequence of the Bacillus subtilis genome between xlyA and ykoR.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for dipeptides; probably responsible for the binding of dipeptides
    with high affinity. Is expressed to facilitate adaptation to
    nutrient deficiency conditions, which also induce sporulation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor (Probable).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed early during sporulation.
-!- INDUCTION: Nutrient deficiency conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 5
    family.
