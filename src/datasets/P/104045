AC   P23500;
Mitochondrial RNA-splicing protein MRS4.
"MRS3 and MRS4, two suppressors of mtRNA splicing defects in yeast,
are new members of the mitochondrial carrier family.";
"Complete DNA sequence of yeast chromosome XI.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: MRS4 suppresses a mitochondrial splice defect in the
    first intron of the COB gene. It may act as a carrier, exerting
    its suppressor activity via modulation of solute concentrations in
    the mitochondrion (possibly of cations). Not essential.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1340 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
