AC   Q9WVR6;
Large neutral amino acids transporter small subunit 2 (L-type amino
acid transporter 2).
"Identification and functional characterization of a Na+-independent
neutral amino acid transporter with broad substrate selectivity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium-independent, high-affinity transport of large
    neutral amino acids. Has higher affinity for L-phenylalanine than
    LAT1 but lower affinity for glutamine and serine. L-alanine is
    transported at physiological concentrations. Plays a role in
    basolateral (re)absorption of neutral amino acids.
-!- SUBUNIT: Disulfide-linked heterodimer with the amino acid
    transport protein SLC3A2/4F2hc.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) (TC 2.A.3.8)
    family.
