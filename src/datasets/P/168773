Sodium/nucleoside cotransporter 2 (Na(+)/nucleoside cotransporter 2)
(Sodium-coupled nucleoside transporter 2) (Concentrative nucleoside
transporter 2) (CNT 2) (hCNT2) (Sodium/purine nucleoside co-
transporter) (SPNT).
"Na+-dependent purine nucleoside transporter from human kidney:
cloning and functional characterization.";
"Molecular cloning, functional expression and chromosomal localization
of a cDNA encoding a human Na+/nucleoside cotransporter (hCNT2)
selective for purine nucleosides and uridine.";
"Identification of amino acid residues responsible for the pyrimidine
and purine nucleoside specificities of human concentrative Na(+)
nucleoside cotransporters hCNT1 and hCNT2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium-dependent and purine-selective transporter.
    Exhibits the transport characteristics of the nucleoside transport
    system cif or N1 subtype (N1/cif) (selective for purine
    nucleosides and uridine). Plays a critical role in specific uptake
    and salvage of purine nucleosides in kidney and other tissues.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by formycin B.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in heart and skeletal muscle
    followed by liver, kidney, intestine, pancreas, placenta and
    brain. Weak expression in lung.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC28A transporter family.
