AC   P80214;
Bacteriocin plantaricin-A precursor.
"The gene encoding plantaricin A, a bacteriocin from Lactobacillus
plantarum C11, is located on the same transcription unit as an agr-
like regulatory system.";
"Characterization of the locus responsible for the bacteriocin
production in Lactobacillus plantarum C11.";
"Complete genome sequence of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1.";
"Purification and characterization of plantaricin A, a Lactobacillus
plantarum bacteriocin whose activity depends on the action of two
peptides.";
-!- FUNCTION: This heat stable bacteriocin inhibits the growth of
    closely related Lactobacillus species. It may act as a pore-
    forming protein, creating a channel in the cell membrane through a
    "barrel stave" mechanism.
-!- SUBUNIT: Active plantaricin A is composed of an alpha chain and a
    beta chain.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The beta chain sequence is shown.
