AC   P36500;
Lantibiotic salivaricin-A precursor.
"Isolation and characterization of the lantibiotic salivaricin A and
its structural gene salA from Streptococcus salivarius 20P3.";
"Salivaricin A gene cluster from Streptococcus salivarius.";
-!- FUNCTION: Lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic)
    active on Gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal activity of
    lantibiotics is based on depolarization of energized bacterial
    cytoplasmic membranes, initiated by the formation of aqueous
    transmembrane pores.
-!- PTM: Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of
    Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether
    bonds with cysteine. This is followed by membrane translocation
    and cleavage of the modified precursor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type A lantibiotic family.
