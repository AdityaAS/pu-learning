-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex is the component
    of the aerobic respiratory chain of E.coli that predominates when
    cells are grown at high aeration.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooctamer of two A chains, two B chains, two C chains
    and two D chains.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
