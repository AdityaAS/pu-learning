AC   P0A0J9; P23215;
Antiseptic resistance protein.
"Efflux-mediated antiseptic resistance gene qacA from Staphylococcus
aureus: common ancestry with tetracycline- and sugar-transport
proteins.";
"Multidrug resistance proteins QacA and QacB from Staphylococcus
aureus: membrane topology and identification of residues involved in
substrate specificity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Confers export-mediated resistance against antiseptic
    and disinfectant compounds such as intercalating dyes, quaternary
    ammonium salts and diamidines.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.
