-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory
    chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Subunits 1-
    3 form the functional core of the enzyme complex. Subunit 2
    transfers the electrons from cytochrome c via its binuclear copper
    A center to the bimetallic center of the catalytic subunit 1.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Copper A.
-!- SUBUNIT: Cytochrome c oxidase is composed of 11 subunits: one copy
    each of COX1, COX2, COX3, COX4, COX5A or COX5B, COX6, COX7, COX9,
    COX12, COX13 and two copies of COX8.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q04935:COX20; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-5024, EBI-36910;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- PTM: The signal sequence of COX2 is processed by IMP1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 family.
