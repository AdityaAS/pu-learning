-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (Potential).

      IsoId=O43826-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O43826-2; Sequence=VSP_006171;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Mostly expressed in liver and kidney.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC37A4 are the cause of glycogen storage
    disease Ib (GSD-Ib) [MIM:232220]. GSD-I are a group of autosomal
    recessive disorders characterized by impairment of terminal steps
    of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Individuals with GSD-I
    manifest a wide range of clinical symptoms and biochemical
    abnormalities, including hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, kidney
    enlargement, growth retardation, lactic acidemia, hyperlipidemia,
    and hyperuricemia.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC37A4 are the cause of glycogen storage
    disease Ic (GSD-Ic) [MIM:232240].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. SLC37A
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.4 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 128.
