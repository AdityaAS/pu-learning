-!- FUNCTION: Cecropins have lytic and antibacterial activity against
    several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- PTM: A protein with the same sequence as cecropin A, but lacking
    the carboxyl blocking group, has been isolated and called cecropin
    C (Ref.3).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cecropin family.
