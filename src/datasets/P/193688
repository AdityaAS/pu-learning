channel 6).

-!- FUNCTION: Essential ion channel and serine/threonine-protein
    kinase. Crucial for magnesium homeostasis. Has an important role
    in epithelial magnesium transport and in the active magnesium
    absorption in the gut and kidney. Isoforms of the type M6-kinase
    lack the ion channel region.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms heterodimers with TRPM7. TRPM6 requires the
    presence of TRPM7 to be targeted to the cell membrane (in HEK 293
    cells).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in kidney and colon. Isoform
    TRPM6a and isoform TRPM6b, are coexpressed with TRPM7 in kidney,
    and testis, and are also found in several cell lines of lung
    origin. Isoform TRPM6c is detected only in testis and in H510
    small cell lung carcinoma cells.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in TRPM6 are the cause of hypomagnesemia with
    secondary hypocalcemia (HOMG) [MIM:602014]; also known as HSH.
    HOMG is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by low levels
    of serum magnesium alongside with a normal renal magnesium
    secretion, secondary hypocalcemia and calcinocis. Affected
    individuals show neurologic symptoms of hypomagnesemic
    hypocalcemia, including seizures and muscle spasms, during
    infancy. Hypocalcemia is secondary to parathyroid failure
    resulting from magnesium deficiency. Untreated, the disorder may
    be fatal or may result in neurological damage. Restoring the
    concentrations of serum magnesium to normal values by high-dose
    magnesium supplementation can overcome the apparent defect in
    magnesium absorption and in serum concentrations of calcium.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the transient
    receptor family. LTrpC subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 alpha-type protein kinase domain.
