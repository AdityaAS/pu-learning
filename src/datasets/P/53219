Very long-chain fatty acid transport protein.
"Disruption of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue to the murine
fatty acid transport protein impairs uptake and growth on long-chain
fatty acids.";
"Complete DNA sequence of yeast chromosome II.";
"Saccharomyces cerevisiae YBR041W sequence update.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in long-chain fatty acids uptake, and
    thus may play a pivotal role in regulating their accessibility
    prior to metabolic utilization. May play an important role in
    uptake of these hydrophobic compounds under conditions where fatty
    acid synthesis is compromised.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q12136:SAS10; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-6819, EBI-36084;
    P10592:SSA2; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-6819, EBI-8603;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 16900 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATP-dependent AMP-binding enzyme
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 620.
