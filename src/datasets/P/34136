AC   P18581;
Low-affinity cationic amino acid transporter 2 (CAT-2) (CAT2) (TEA
protein) (T-cell early activation protein) (20.5).
"Identification of a low affinity, high capacity transporter of
cationic amino acids in mouse liver.";
"Control of cationic amino acid transport and retroviral receptor
functions in a membrane protein family.";
"Activated T cells express a novel gene on chromosome 8 that is
closely related to the murine ecotropic retroviral receptor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Low-affinity, high capacity permease involved in the
    transport of the cationic amino acids (arginine, lysine and
    ornithine).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Alpha;
      IsoId=P18581-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Beta;
      IsoId=P18581-2; Sequence=VSP_000025;
      Note=Affinity of isoform Beta for arginine uptake is 70-fold
      higher than for isoform Alpha;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highest expression in liver and T-cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. Cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) (TC 2.A.3.3)
    family.
