-!- FUNCTION: Required for correct localization of precursor proteins
    bearing signal peptides with the twin arginine conserved motif
    S/T-R-R-X-F-L-K. This sec-independent pathway is termed TAT for
    twin-arginine translocation system. This system mainly transports
    proteins with bound cofactors that require folding prior to export
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tatA/E family.
