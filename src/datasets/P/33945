"Cloning and characterization of a novel Bacillus thuringiensis
cytolytic delta-endotoxin.";
"Structure of the mosquitocidal delta-endotoxin CytB from Bacillus
thuringiensis sp. kyushuensis and implications for membrane pore
formation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Kills the larvae of dipteran insects by making pores in
    the epithelial cell membrane of the insect midgut.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (protoxin) and monomer (active toxin).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: The crystal protein is produced during
    sporulation and is accumulated both as an inclusion and as part of
    the spore coat.
-!- PTM: Active after proteolytic processing.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyt1/cyt2 endotoxin family.
