-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the transport of antigens from the cytoplasm
    to the endoplasmic reticulum for association with MHC class I
    molecules. Also acts as a molecular scaffold for the final stage
    of MHC class I folding, namely the binding of peptide. Nascent MHC
    class I molecules associate with TAP via tapasin. Inhibited by the
    covalent attachment of herpes simplex virus ICP47 protein, which
    blocks the peptide-binding site of TAP. Inhibited by human
    cytomegalovirus US6 glycoprotein, which binds to the lumenal side
    of the TAP complex and inhibits peptide translocation by
    specifically blocking ATP-binding to TAP1 and prevents the
    conformational rearrangement of TAP induced by peptide binding.
    Inhibited by human adenovirus E3-19K glycoprotein, which binds the
    TAP complex and acts as a tapasin inhibitor, preventing MHC class
    I/TAP association.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of TAP1 and TAP2.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q03518:TAP1; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-780781, EBI-780739;
    O15533:TAPBP; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-780781, EBI-874801;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Note=The transmembrane
    segments seem to form a pore in the membrane.
-!- INDUCTION: By interferon gamma.
-!- DOMAIN: The peptide-binding site is shared between the cytoplasmic
    loops of TAP1 and TAP2.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: 4 common alleles are officially recognized:
    TAP2*0101 (TAP2A or PSF2A or RING11A), TAP2*0102 (TAP2E),
    TAP2*0103 (TAP2F), and TAP2*0201 (TAP2B or PSF2B or RING11B).
    Other relatively common alleles have been identified: TAP2*01D,
    TAP2*01E, TAP2*01F, TAP2*01G, TAP2*01H, TAP2*02B, TAP2*02C
    (TAP2*0202), TAP2*02D, TAP2*02E, TAP2*02F, TAP2*03A and TAP2*04A.
    The sequence shown is that of TAP2*0101.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: The allele TAP2*Bky2 is commonly found only in the
    Japanese population. It may be associated with susceptibility to
    Sjoegren syndrome, an autoimmune disorder characterized by
    abnormal dryness of the conjunctiva, cornea and mouth due to
    exocrine glands dysfunction.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
