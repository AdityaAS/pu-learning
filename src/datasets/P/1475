-!- FUNCTION: Xenobiotic transporter that may play an important role
    in the exclusion of xenobiotics from the brain. May be involved in
    brain-to-blood efflux. Appears to play a major role in the
    multidrug resistance phenotype of several cancer cell lines. When
    overexpressed, the transfected cells become resistant to
    mitoxantrone, daunorubicin and doxorubicin, display diminished
    intracellular accumulation of daunorubicin, and manifest an ATP-
    dependent increase in the efflux of rhodamine 123.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer or homodimer; disulfide-linked.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
