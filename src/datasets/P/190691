Trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase 2 precursor (EC 1.7.2.3) (TMAO
reductase 2) (Trimethylamine oxidase 2).

-!- FUNCTION: Reduces trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) into
    trimethylamine; an anaerobic reaction coupled to energy-yielding
    reactions. Can also reduce other N- and S-oxide compounds such as
    4-methylmorpholine-N-oxide and biotin sulfoxide (BSO), but with a
    lower catalytic efficiency (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Trimethylamine + 2 (ferricytochrome c)-subunit
    + H(2)O = trimethylamine N-oxide + 2 (ferrocytochrome c)-subunit +
    2 H(+).
-!- COFACTOR: Molybdenum (molybdopterin) (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Predicted to be exported by the Tat system. The position of
    the signal peptide cleavage has not been experimentally proven.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Expression of torYZ allows E.coli to grow
    anaerobically on a wider range of substrates than does expression
    of torCAD (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family.
