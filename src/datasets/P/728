-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the several different receptors for 5-
    hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), a biogenic hormone that functions
    as a neurotransmitter, a hormone, and a mitogen. This receptor is
    a ligand-gated ion channel, which when activated causes fast,
    depolarizing responses in neurons. It is a cation-specific, but
    otherwise relatively nonselective, ion channel.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
