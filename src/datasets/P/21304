AC   Q05596;
Cobalt import ATP-binding protein cbiO.
"Characterization of the cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthetic genes of
Salmonella typhimurium.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex cbiONQ involved in
    cobalt import. Responsible for energy coupling to the transport
    system.
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (cbiO), fused or not, two transmembrane proteins (cbiQ) and a
    solute-binding protein (cbiN) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Cobalt importer
    (TC 3.A.1.18.1) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
