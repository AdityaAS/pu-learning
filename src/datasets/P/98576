AC   Q9X2W0;
Microcin J25 export ATP-binding/permease protein mcjD (Microcin J25
secretion ATP-binding protein mcjD) (Microcin J25 immunity protein).
"Sequence analysis of the four plasmid genes required to produce the
circular peptide antibiotic microcin J25.";
"Genetic analysis of plasmid determinants for microcin J25 production
and immunity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Is able to protect a cell, which harbors the plasmid
    pTUC100 encoding microcin J25, against microcin J25. Is required
    for microcin J25 export out of the producing cells.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
