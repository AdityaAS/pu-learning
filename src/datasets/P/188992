-!- FUNCTION: Essential component of the TIM23 complex, a complex that
    mediates the translocation of transit peptide-containing proteins
    across the mitochondrial inner membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the TIM23 complex, at least composed of
    TIM23, TIM17, TIM50 and TIM21. The complex interacts with the
    TIM44 component of the PAM complex.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1210 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tim17/Tim22/Tim23 family.
