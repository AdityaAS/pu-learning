-!- FUNCTION: Uptake of L-rhamnose across the boundary membrane with
    the concomitant transport of protons into the cell (symport
    system). Can also transport L-mannose and L-xylose, but at reduced
    rates.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by L-rhamnose via the rhaR-rhaS regulatory
    cascade. Also induced by L-mannose or L-xylose.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the L-rhamnose transporter (TC 2.A.7.6)
    family.
