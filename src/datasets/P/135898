Galactitol-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA component
(EC 2.7.1.-) (PTS system galactitol-specific EIIA component) (EIIA-
Gat).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in galactitol transport (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIA N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine +
    protein EIIB = protein EIIA + protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIA domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr on a
    histidyl residue. Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the
    EIIB domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIA type-2 domain.
