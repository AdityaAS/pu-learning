AC   P09883;
Colicin-E9 (EC 3.1.-.-).
"Nucleotide sequences from the colicin E5, E6 and E9 operons: presence
of a degenerate transposon-like structure in the ColE9-J plasmid.";
"Complete nucleotide sequence of the colicin E9 (cei) gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: This plasmid-coded bactericidal protein is an
    endonuclease active on both single- and double-stranded DNA but
    with undefined specificity.
