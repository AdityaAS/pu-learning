Vacuolar ATP synthase subunit c' (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-ATPase c' subunit)
(Vacuolar proton pump c' subunit) (V-ATPase 16 kDa proteolipid subunit
2) (Proteolipid protein VMA11).

activity.";

-!- FUNCTION: Proton-conducting pore forming subunit of the membrane
    integral V0 complex of vacuolar ATPase. V-ATPase is responsible
    for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in
    eukaryotic cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (components A to H) attached to an
    integral membrane V0 proton pore complex (components: a, c, c',
    c'', d and e). The proteolipid components c, c' and c'' are
    present as a hexameric ring that forms the proton-conducting pore.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 538 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase proteolipid subunit family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 102.
