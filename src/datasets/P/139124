AC   P46911;
Menaquinol-cytochrome c reductase iron-sulfur subunit (Rieske iron-
sulfur protein).
"The cytochrome bc complex (menaquinone:cytochrome c reductase) in
Bacillus subtilis has a nontraditional subunit organization.";
"Sequence analysis of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome region between
the serA and kdg loci cloned in a yeast artificial chromosome.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the menaquinol-cytochrome c reductase
    complex. The Rieske protein is a high potential 2Fe-2S protein.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The main subunits of the menaquinone:cytochrome c complex
    are: cytochrome b, the Rieske protein and a cytochrome b/c
    subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Rieske domain.
