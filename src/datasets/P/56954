-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for the siderophore ferripyoverdine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- INDUCTION: By the siderophore, pyoverdine, and under iron
    starvation conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tonB-dependent receptor family.
-!- CAUTION: It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-16 is the initiator.
