-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export. Interacts with secA and secE
    to allow the translocation of proteins across the plasma membrane,
    by forming part of a channel.
-!- SUBUNIT: One of seven secretory proteins (secA-F and secY) that
    comprise the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secY/SEC61-alpha family.
