Low affinity potassium transport system protein kup (Kup system
potassium uptake protein).
"Nucleotide sequence and 3'-end deletion studies indicate that the
K(+)-uptake protein kup from Escherichia coli is composed of a
hydrophobic core linked to a large and partially essential hydrophilic
C-terminus.";

-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the low-affinity transport of potassium
    into the cell, with the probable concomitant uptake of protons
    (symport system). Can also transport cesium.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Kup is probably the major potassium uptake system
    upon hyper-osmotic stress at a low pH.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Uptake is inhibited by protonophores such as CCCP.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HAK/KUP transporter (TC 2.A.72) family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to frameshifts
    in positions 506, 542 and 579.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 sequence differs from that shown due to frameshifts
    in positions 506 and 542.
