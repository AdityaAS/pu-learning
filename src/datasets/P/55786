AC   P26465;
Flagellum-specific ATP synthase (EC 3.6.3.14).
"Salmonella typhimurium mutants defective in flagellar filament
regrowth and sequence similarity of FliI to F0F1, vacuolar, and
archaebacterial ATPase subunits.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Genetic and biochemical analysis of Salmonella typhimurium FliI, a
flagellar protein related to the catalytic subunit of the F0F1 ATPase
and to virulence proteins of mammalian and plant pathogens.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable catalytic subunit of a protein translocase for
    flagellum-specific export, or a proton translocase involved in
    local circuits at the flagellum. May be involved in a specialized
    protein export pathway that proceeds without signal peptide
    cleavage.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
