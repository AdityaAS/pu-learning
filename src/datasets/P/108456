AC   P48765;
Sodium/calcium exchanger 1 precursor (Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchange protein
1).
"Cloning and expression of the bovine cardiac sodium-calcium
exchanger.";
"Purification and amino-terminal sequence of the bovine cardiac
sodium-calcium exchanger: evidence for the presence of a signal
sequence.";
"Identification of the sodium-calcium exchanger as the major ricin-
binding glycoprotein of bovine rod outer segments and its localization
to the plasma membrane.";
-!- FUNCTION: Rapidly transports Ca(2+) during excitation-contraction
    coupling. Ca(2+) is extruded from the cell during relaxation so as
    to prevent overloading of intracellular stores.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: By ATP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Cardiac sarcolemma.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger
    family. SLC8 subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 Calx-beta domains.
