AC   P28542; Q5V1U5;
Preprotein translocase secY subunit (Protein transport protein SEC61
subunit alpha homolog).
"The genes for ribosomal protein L15 and the protein equivalent to
secY in the archaebacterium Haloarcula (Halobacterium) marismortui.";
"Genome sequence of Haloarcula marismortui: a halophilic archaeon from
the Dead Sea.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export. Interacts with secE to allow
    the translocation of proteins across the plasma membrane, by
    forming part of a channel (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the protein translocase complex.
    Heterotrimer consisting of alpha (secY), beta (secG) and gamma
    (secE) subunits. Can form oligomers of the heterotrimer (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secY/SEC61-alpha family.
