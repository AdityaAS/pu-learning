AC   P60068;
Chlorate reductase subunit alpha precursor (EC 1.97.1.1) (Chlorate
reductase molybdenum subunit).
"A gene cluster for chlorate metabolism in Ideonella dechloratans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Terminal reductase that allows anaerobic growth on
    chlorate as the sole respiratory oxidant.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: AH(2) + chlorate = A + H(2)O + chlorite.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster (Potential).
-!- COFACTOR: Molybdenum (molybdopterin).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimer of alpha, beta and gamma subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- PTM: Predicted to be exported by the Tat system. The position of
    the signal peptide cleavage has not been experimentally proven.
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Has potential use in bioremediation of waste sites
    contaminated with chlorate, such as pulp and paper industry
    wastewater.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family.
