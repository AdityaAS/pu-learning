-!- FUNCTION: NOH-1S is a voltage-gated proton channel that mediates
    the H(+) currents of resting phagocytes and other tissues. It
    participates in the regulation of cellular pH and is blocked by
    zinc. NOH-1L is a pyridine nucleotide-dependent oxidoreductase
    that generates superoxide and might conduct H(+) ions as part of
    its electron transport mechanism, whereas NOH-1S does not contain
    an electron transport chain.
-!- COFACTOR: NADP (Potential).
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (Potential).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: The oxidase activity is potentiated by NOXO1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with NOXO1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: NOH-1L is detected in colon, uterus, prostate,
    and colon carcinoma, but not in peripheral blood leukocytes. NOH-
    1S is detected only in colon and colon carcinoma cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ferric oxidoreductase domain.
