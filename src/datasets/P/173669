-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the Na(+)-independent transport of organic
    anions such as taurochlate, bromosulfophthalein and steroid
    conjugates such as estrone-3-sulfate, 17-beta-glucuronosyl
    estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and prostaglandin E2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; basolateral cell membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein. Note=Confined to the basolateral
    plasma membrane of hepatocytes.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
    Name=1; Synonyms=rLST-1b;
      IsoId=Q9QZX8-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2; Synonyms=rLST-1a;
      IsoId=Q9QZX8-2; Sequence=VSP_006150;
    Name=3; Synonyms=rLST-1c;
      IsoId=Q9QZX8-3; Sequence=VSP_006151, VSP_006150;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Liver specific. Expression is highest in
    central perivenous hepatocytes and lowest in the periportal
    region. Isoform 2 predominates. Not detected in heart, brain,
    kidney, skeletal muscle, lung, testis or spleen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the organo anion transporter (TC 2.A.60)
    family.
