-!- FUNCTION: Formate dehydrogenase allows E.coli to use formate as
    major electron donor during anaerobic respiration, when nitrate is
    used as electron acceptor. Subunit gamma is the cytochrome
    b556(FDN) component of the formate dehydrogenase.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 heme groups per subunit.
-!- PATHWAY: Anaerobic nitrate respiration.
-!- SUBUNIT: Trimer of heterotrimers, consisting of subunits alpha,
    beta and gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrate under anaerobic conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the formate dehydrogenase gamma subunit
    family.
