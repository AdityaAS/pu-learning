AC   P0AER6; P41075;
Glutamate/aspartate transport system permease protein gltK.
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for aspartate/glutamate; probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrate across the membrane (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. HisMQ subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
