-!- FUNCTION: Bacterial hemolysins are exotoxins that attack blood
    cell membranes and cause cell rupture by mechanisms not clearly
    defined.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein. Note=In the hemolytic
    biotype El Tor the 80 kDa hemolysin precursor is secreted and
    extracellularly cleaved, producing active 65 kDa hemolysin.
-!- INDUCTION: By hemolysin B cytoplasmic protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hlyA hemolysin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ricin B-type lectin domain.
