AC   P60693; Q9ZNG1;
Na(+)/H(+) antiporter subunit F (Mnh complex subunit F).
"Whole genome sequencing of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mnh complex is a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter involved in Na(+)
    excretion (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: May form a hetero-oligomeric complex that consists of
    seven subunits: mnhA, mnhB, mnhC, mnhD, mnhE, mnhF and mnhG (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CPA3 antiporters (TC 2.A.63) subunit F
    family.
