Galectin-9 (36 kDa beta-galactoside-binding lectin) (Urate
transporter/channel) (UAT).
"Identification and characterization of galectin-9, a novel beta-
galactoside-binding mammalian lectin.";
"Molecular cloning and functional reconstitution of a urate
transporter/channel.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds galactosides. May play a role in thymocyte-
    epithelial interactions relevant to the biology of the thymus. Is
    a ligand for HAVCR2/TIM3. Induces T-helper type 1 lymphocyte (Th1)
    death (By similarity). May provide the molecular basis for urate
    flux across cell membranes, allowing urate that is formed during
    purine metabolism to efflux from cells and serving as an
    electrogenic transporter that plays an important role in renal and
    gastrointestinal urate excretion. Highly selective to the anion
    urate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Secreted protein
    (By similarity). Note=May also be secreted by a non-classical
    secretory pathway (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
      Comment=Additional isoforms seem to exist;
    Name=Long;
      IsoId=P97840-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Short;
      IsoId=P97840-2; Sequence=VSP_003098;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: The isoform Long is expressed exclusively in
    the small intestine.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains two homologous but distinct carbohydrate-binding
    domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 galectin domains.
