AC   P0A3W7; P05358; P09782;
Protein virB9 precursor.
"Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence of the Agrobacterium
tumefaciens virB operon.";
"Octopine-type Ti plasmid sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Is essential for the biogenesis of the T-pilus, which is
    required for virulence and T-DNA transfer to plant cells. When is
    associated with virB7, might function as a nucleation center for
    recruitment of virB proteins during assembly of the T-DNA transfer
    machine (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of virB7 and virB9; disulfide-linked (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (By similarity).
