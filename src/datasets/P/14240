AC   Q12165;
ATP synthase delta chain, mitochondrial precursor (EC 3.6.3.14).
"ATP synthase of yeast mitochondria. Isolation of the F1 delta
subunit, sequence and disruption of the structural gene.";

cerevisiae ORFs in the Gateway recombinational cloning system.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton
    gradient across the membrane. May be involved in the stability of
    the catalytic sector.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase epsilon chain family.
