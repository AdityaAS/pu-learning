-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a novel pathway of export of proteins that
    lack a cleavable signal sequence. It may be an accessory subunit
    to an essential core component of the non-classical export
    machinery. Alternatively, its role in export may be indirect.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
