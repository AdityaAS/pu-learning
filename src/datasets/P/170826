-!- FUNCTION: Essential for protein export.
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus
    which comprise secA, secB, secD, secE, secF, secG and secY. The
    translocation channel seems to be composed of a secA homodimer and
    four copies of a secYEG complex.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secE/SEC61-gamma family.
