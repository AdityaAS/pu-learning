AC   P35206;
Mannosyl phosphorylinositol ceramide synthase regulatory protein CSG2
precursor.
"A novel protein, CSG2p, is required for Ca2+ regulation in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"The CLS2 gene encodes a protein with multiple membrane-spanning
domains that is important Ca2+ tolerance in yeast.";
"Complete DNA sequence of yeast chromosome II.";
"The complete sequence of a 33 kb fragment on the right arm of
chromosome II from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals 16 open reading
frames, including ten new open reading frames, five previously
identified genes and a homologue of the SCO1 gene.";
"Accumulation of the cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II in yeast
requires a mitochondrial membrane-associated protein, encoded by the
nuclear SCO1 gene.";
"Csg1p and newly identified Csh1p function in mannosylinositol
phosphorylceramide synthesis by interacting with Csg2p.";
"A global topology map of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for calcium regulation. May regulate calcium
    accumulation by a non-vacuole organelle. Also regulates the
    activity of CSH1 and SUR1 during mannosyl phosphorylinositol
    ceramide synthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of CSH1 and CSG2, and SUR1 and CSG2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
