Probable serine/threonine-protein kinase Cx32, chloroplast precursor
(EC 2.7.11.1).

for connexins in plants.";

thaliana.";

-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) reported to be a connexin and to
    contain transmembrane domains. Ref.4 authors have assigned that
    this is not a connexin, but rather a protein kinase.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to several
    frameshifts and sequencing errors.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequences differ from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
