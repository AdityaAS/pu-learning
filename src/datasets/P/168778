AC   O54698;
Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (Equilibrative
nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside-sensitive nucleoside transporter)
(Equilibrative NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transporter) (Nucleoside
transporter, es-type) (Solute carrier family 29 member 1).
"Molecular cloning and functional characterization of
nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-sensitive (es) and NBMPR-insensitive
(ei) equilibrative nucleoside transporter proteins (rENT1 and rENT2)
from rat tissues.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates both influx and efflux of nucleosides across
    the membrane (equilibrative transporter). It is sensitive (ES) to
    low concentrations of the inhibitor nitrobenzylmercaptopurine
    riboside (NBMPR) and is sodium-independent. It has a higher
    affinity for adenosine. Resistant to dipyridamole and dilazep
    inhibition (anticancer chemotherapeutics drugs).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in jejunum, liver and lung.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC29A transporter family.
