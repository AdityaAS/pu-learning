AC   P80967;
Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM5 (Translocase of outer
membrane 5 kDa subunit).
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XVI.";
"Creation of the YFLEX clone resource: cloning of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae ORFs in the Gateway recombinational cloning system.";
"Tom5 functionally links mitochondrial preprotein receptors to the
general import pore.";
"Preprotein translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane: molecular
dissection and assembly of the general import pore complex.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the TOM (translocase of outer membrane)
    receptor complex responsible for the recognition and translocation
    of cytosolically synthesized mitochondrial preproteins. TOM5 is
    involved in insertion of preproteins into the TOM40 translocation
    pore.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms part of the TOM (translocase of outer membrane)
    complex that consists of at least 7 different proteins (TOM5,
    TOM6, TOM7, TOM20, TOM22, TOM40 and TOM70).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane;
    single-pass membrane protein (Potential). Note=Outer membrane-
    anchored (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tom5 family.
