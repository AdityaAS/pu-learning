-!- FUNCTION: Channel that opens in response to stretch forces in the
    membrane lipid bilayer. May participate in the regulation of
    osmotic pressure changes within the cell.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homopentamer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mscL family.
