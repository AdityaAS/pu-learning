Protein SNQ2.
"Gene SNQ2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which confers resistance to 4-
nitroquinoline-N-oxide and other chemicals, encodes a 169 kDa protein
homologous to ATP-dependent permeases.";
"Sequencing and analysis of a 35.4 kb region on the right arm of
chromosome IV from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveal 23 open reading
frames.";

"Identification and characterization of SNQ2, a new multidrug ATP
binding cassette transporter of the yeast plasma membrane.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Could be an ATP-dependent permease. Confers hyper-
    resistance to the mutagens 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO) and
    triaziquone, as well as to the chemicals sulphomethuron methyl
    phenanthroline when present in multiple copies. Exhibits
    nucleoside triphosphatase activity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1300 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. PDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
