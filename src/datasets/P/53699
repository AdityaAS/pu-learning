-!- FUNCTION: Formate dehydrogenase allows the bacterium to use
    formate as major electron donor during anaerobic respiration, when
    nitrate is used as electron acceptor. The beta chain is an
    electron transfer unit containing 4 cysteine clusters involved in
    the formation of iron-sulfur centers. Electrons are transferred
    from the gamma chain to the molybdenum cofactor of the alpha
    subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 4 4Fe-4S clusters per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Anaerobic nitrate respiration.
-!- SUBUNIT: Trimer of heterotrimers, consisting of subunits alpha,
    beta and gamma (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrate under anaerobic conditions (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
