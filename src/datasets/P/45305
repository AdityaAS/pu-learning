-!- FUNCTION: Generates hydrogen peroxide which is required for the
    activity of thyroid peroxidase/TPO and lactoperoxidase/LPO. Plays
    a role in thyroid hormones synthesis and lactoperoxidase-mediated
    antimicrobial defense at the surface of mucosa. May have its own
    peroxidase activity through its N-terminal peroxidase-like domain.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NAD(P)H + O(2) = NAD(P)(+) + H(2)O(2).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Peroxidase activity is inhibited by
    aminobenzohydrazide (By similarity). The NADPH oxidase activity is
    calcium-dependent.
-!- PATHWAY: Thyroid hormone biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with TXNDC11, TPO and CYBA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; apical cell membrane; multi-
    pass membrane protein. Note=Localizes to the apical membrane of
    epithelial cells.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in colon, small intestine, duodenum
    and tracheal surface epithelial cells (at protein level).
    Expressed in thyrocytes. Also detected in kidney, liver, lung,
    pancreas, prostate, salivary glands, rectum and testis.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Widely expressed in fetal tissues.
-!- INDUCTION: By forskolin, thyrotropin and the Th1-specific cytokine
    interferon gamma.
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in DUOX2 are a cause of congenital hypothyroidism
    (CH) [MIM:607200]. This form of CH, characterized by a defect in
    hydrogen peroxide production in the thyroid gland, is due to a
    loss of DUOX2 function. It results in total iodide organification
    defects (TIOD) in the case of biallelic inactivating mutations or
    partial iodide organification defects (PIOD) in the case of
    monoallelic inactivating mutations.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the peroxidase
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 EF-hand domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ferric oxidoreductase domain.
