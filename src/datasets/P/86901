AC   P97438;
Potassium channel subfamily K member 2 (Outward rectifying potassium
channel protein TREK-1) (Two-pore potassium channel TPKC1) (TREK-1
K(+) channel subunit).
"Cloning, functional expression and brain localization of a novel
unconventional outward rectifier K+ channel.";
"Inhalational anesthetics activate two-pore-domain background K+
channels.";
-!- FUNCTION: Outward rectifying potassium channel.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: High expression in brain and lung. Also
    detected in kidney, heart and skeletal muscle. Not detected in
    liver. In the brain, highest expression in olfactory bulb,
    hippocampus and cerebellum.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibited by barium. Activated by volatile general
    anaesthetics such as chloroform, diethyl ether, halothane and
    isoflurane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the two pore domain potassium channel
    (TC 1.A.1.8) family.
