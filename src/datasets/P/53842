AC   Q7MV19;
Ferrous iron transport protein B.
"Complete genome sequence of the oral pathogenic bacterium
Porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83.";
"A novel Porphyromonas gingivalis FeoB plays a role in manganese
accumulation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Fe(2+) uptake system, probably driven by GTP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Insertional inactivation feoB1 mutant is avirulent
    and therefore unable to cause lesions in mice.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the feoB (TC 9.A.8) family.
