-!- FUNCTION: Determines N-hexane tolerance. Involved in outer
    membrane permeability. Essential for envelope biogenesis. Could be
    part of a targeting/usher system for outer membrane components.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a high-molecular-weight complex in the outer
    membrane. No evidence for its interaction with other proteins is
    seen when it is isolated from outer membrane preparations.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- PTM: Forms at least two disulfide bridges, one inter- and one
    intramolecular.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the imp/ostA family.
