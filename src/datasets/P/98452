Microcin E492 precursor (MccE492).
"Identification and properties of the genes encoding microcin E492 and
its immunity protein.";
"Siderophore peptide, a new type of post-translationally modified
antibacterial peptide with potent activity.";
"Microcin E492 forms ion channels in phospholipid bilayer membrane.";
-!- FUNCTION: Channel-forming bacteriocin. Forms cation-selective
    channels. Active on enterobacteria.
-!- PTM: The C-terminal Ser is modified by attachment to a siderophore
    similar to enterobactin, which can bind one atom of iron. The
    modification consists of an ester linkage of the serine carboxyl
    to O6 of a glucose which is linked by a C-glycosidic bond to the
    5'-benzoyl of a linear triester of N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)serine.

    RANGE=20-103; NOTE=Ref.2.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=7887; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=20-103; NOTE=Ser-
    103 unmodified form (Ref.3).
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=8718; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=20-103; NOTE=Ser-
    103 modified form (Ref.3).
