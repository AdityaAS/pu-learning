-!- FUNCTION: Pump for glutathione S-conjugates. Mediates the
    transport of S-conjugates such as GSH, S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-
    glutathione (DNP-GS), GSSG, cyanidin 3-glucoside-GS (C3G-GS) and
    metolachlor-GS (MOC-GS), glucuronides such as 17-beta-estradiol
    17-(beta-D-glucuronide) (E(2)17betaG), and of the chlorophyll
    catabolite such as B.napus nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolite
    (Bn-NCC-1).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + xenobiotic(In) = ADP + phosphate
    + xenobiotic(Out).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Reciprocal promotion of DNP-GS and E(2)17betaG
    uptake. E(2)17betaG uptake is also stimulated by GSH and S-methyl-
    glutathione (S-methyl-GS), and, to a lower extent, by GSSG and
    C3G-GS. Metolachlor-GS and decyl-GS slightly inhibit E(2)17betaG
    uptake.
