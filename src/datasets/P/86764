-!- FUNCTION: Potassium channel activated by both membrane
    depolarization or increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) that mediates
    export of K(+). It is also activated by the concentration of
    cytosolic Mg(2+). Its activation dampens the excitatory events
    that elevate the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and/or depolarize
    the cell membrane. It therefore contributes to repolarization of
    the membrane potential. Plays a key role in controlling
    excitability in a number of systems, such as regulation of the
    contraction of smooth muscle, the tuning of hair cells in the
    cochlea, regulation of transmitter release, and innate immunity.
    In smooth muscles, its activation by high level of Ca(2+), caused
    by ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, regulates
    the membrane potential. In cochlea cells, its number and kinetic
    properties partly determine the characteristic frequency of each
    hair cell and thereby helps to establish a tonotopic map. Kinetics
    of KCNMA1 channels are determined by alternative splicing,
    phosphorylation status and its combination with modulating beta
    subunits. Highly sensitive to both iberiotoxin (IbTx) and
    charybdotoxin (CTX).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer; which constitutes the calcium-activated
    potassium channel. Interacts with beta subunits KCNMB1, KCNMB2,
    KCNMB3 and KCNMB4. Beta subunits are accessory, and modulate its
    activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Isoform 11: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein. Note=Isoform 11 has a dominant-
    negative effect on other isoforms, preventing their localization
    to the cell membrane.

-!- DOMAIN: The S0 segment is essential for the modulation by the
    accessory beta subunits KCNMB1, KCNMB2, KCNMB3 and KCNMB4 (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The S4 segment, which is characterized by a series of
    positively charged amino acids at every third position, is part of
    the voltage-sensor (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The pore-forming domain (also referred as P region) is
    imbedded into the membrane, and forms the selectivity filter of
    the pore. It contains the signature sequence of potassium channels
    that displays selectivity to potassium (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The RCK N-terminal domain mediates the
    homotetramerization, thereby promoting the assembly of monomers
    into functional potassium channel. It includes binding sites for
    Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The calcium bowl constitutes one of the Ca(2+) sensors and
    probably acts as a Ca(2+)-binding site. There are however other
    Ca(2+) sensors regions required for activation of the channel (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (Probable). Phosphorylation by kinases such as
    PKA and/or PKG. In smooth muscles, phosphorylation affects its
    activity (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The protein was initially thought to contain two
    functionally distinct parts: The core channel (from the N-terminus
    to the S9 segment) that mediates the channel activity, and the
    cytoplasmic tail (from the S9 segment to the C-terminus) that
    mediates the calcium sensing. The situation is however more
    complex, since the core channel contains binding sites for Ca(2+)
    and Mg(2+).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family. Calcium-
    activated subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RCK N-terminal domain.
