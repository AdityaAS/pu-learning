-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex metNIQ involved in
    methionine import. Responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system (Probable). It has also been shown to be involved
    in formyl-L-methionine transport.
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (metN), two transmembrane proteins (metI) and a solute-binding
    protein (metQ) (Probable).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0A6N1:tufA; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-541886, EBI-301077;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Methionine
    importer (TC 3.A.1.24) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (BAA03659) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 106 and 156.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.6 (AAC36869) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 200.
