-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the high-affinity D-xylose membrane
    transport system. Binds with high affinity to xylose.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: E.coli has two D-xylose transport systems that
    accumulate sugar against a concentration gradient: the xylE system
    which utilizes the electrochemical gradient of protons and that is
    insensitive to cold osmotic shock and the xylF system that uses a
    high-energy phosphate compound and is sensitive to cold osmotic
    shock.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 2
    family.
