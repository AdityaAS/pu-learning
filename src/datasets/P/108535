Sodium-dependent high-affinity dicarboxylate transporter 3
(Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter 3) (NaDC-3) (ceNaDC3).
"Structural and functional characteristics of two sodium-coupled
dicarboxylate transporters (ceNaDC1 and ceNaDC2) from Caenorhabditis
elegans and their relevance to life span.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter that
    accepts a range of tricarboxylic acid-cycle intermediates with 4-5
    carbon atoms. There is no interaction with monocarboxylates. Plays
    a role in the regulation of life span.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=a;
      IsoId=Q21339-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=b;
      IsoId=Q21339-2; Sequence=VSP_009680;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Nad-1 and nad-2 are coexpressed in the
    intestinal tract from early larvae to adults, expression is from
    the pharynx through to the anus. Expression level is significantly
    greater in the anterior half of the intestine than in the
    posterior half.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Not detected in the embryo. Expressed at the
    early larval, late larval and adult stages, with highest levels at
    the late larval stage.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC13A transporter (TC 2.A.47) family.
    NADC subfamily.
