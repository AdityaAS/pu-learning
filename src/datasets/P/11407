AC   P08690;
Arsenical pump-driving ATPase (EC 3.6.3.16) (Arsenite-translocating
ATPase) (Arsenical resistance ATPase) (Arsenite-transporting ATPase).
"Nucleotide sequence of the structural genes for an anion pump. The
plasmid-encoded arsenical resistance operon.";
"The plasmid-encoded arsenical resistance pump: an anion-translocating
ATPase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Anion-transporting ATPase. Catalyzes the extrusion of
    the oxyanions arsenite, antimonite and arsenate. Maintenance of a
    low intracellular concentration of oxyanion produces resistance to
    the toxic agents.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + arsenite(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    arsenite(Out).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the arsA ATPase family.
