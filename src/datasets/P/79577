Methylosome subunit pICln (Chloride conductance regulatory protein
ICln) (I(Cln)) (Chloride channel, nucleotide sensitive 1A) (Chloride
ion current inducer protein) (ClCI) (Reticulocyte pICln).

"pICln inhibits snRNP biogenesis by binding core spliceosomal

"The methylosome, a 20S complex containing JBP1 and pICln, produces
dimethylarginine-modified Sm proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: The interaction with Sm proteins inhibits their assembly
    on U RNA and interferes with snRNP biogenesis. Inhibits the
    binding of survival motor neuron protein (SMN) to Sm proteins. May
    participate in cellular volume control by activation of a
    swelling-induced chloride conductance pathway.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homooligomer. Component of the methylosome, a 20S complex
    containing SKB1. Interacts with Sm proteins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Cytoplasm; cytoskeleton.
    Note=A small fraction is also associated with the cytoskeleton.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pICln family.
