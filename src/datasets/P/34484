-!- FUNCTION: Part of a cation efflux system that mediates resistance
    to copper and silver.
-!- SUBUNIT: The cus efflux system is composed of cusA, cusB, cusC and
    cusF.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Transcriptionally regulated by cusR in response to
    copper and silver ions.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The cus system plays an important role in copper
    tolerance under anaerobic growth and, under extreme copper stress,
    in aerobic growth.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acrB/acrD/acrF (TC 2.A.6) family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.5 (M58000) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 897 and 933.
