ADP/ATP translocase 2 (Adenine nucleotide translocator 2) (ANT 2)
(ADP,ATP carrier protein 2) (Solute carrier family 25 member 5)
(ADP,ATP carrier protein, fibroblast isoform).
"The human fibroblast adenine nucleotide translocator gene. Molecular
cloning and sequence.";
"Molecular cloning of a cDNA for a human ADP/ATP carrier which is
growth-regulated.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Two distinct genes for ADP/ATP translocase are expressed at the mRNA
level in adult human liver.";
"Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization by HIV-1 Vpr.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the exchange of ADP and ATP across the
    mitochondrial inner membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Interaacts with HIV-1 vpr.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The transmembrane helices are not perpendicular to
    the plane of the membrane, but cross the membrane at an angle.
    Odd-numbered transmembrane helices exhibit a sharp kink, due to
    the presence of a conserved proline residue (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
