-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory
    chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Subunits 1-
    3 form the functional core of the enzyme complex. Subunit 2
    transfers the electrons from cytochrome c via its binuclear copper
    A center to the bimetallic center of the catalytic subunit 1.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Copper A.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 family.
