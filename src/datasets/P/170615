-!- FUNCTION: Required for integral membrane and secreted preprotein
    translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the multicomponent translocon that contains the
    trimeric SEC61 complex, SEC62 and SEC63.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed, with high levels in the
    liver.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SEC63 are a cause of autosomal dominant
    polycystic liver disease (PCLD) [MIM:174050].
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 J domain.
