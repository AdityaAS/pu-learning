AC   P26431;
Sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1) (NHE-1) (Solute
carrier family 9 member 1).
"Molecular cloning of putative members of the Na/H exchanger gene
family. cDNA cloning, deduced amino acid sequence, and mRNA tissue
expression of the rat Na/H exchanger NHE-1 and two structurally
related proteins.";
"Topological analysis of NHE1, the ubiquitous Na+/H+ exchanger using
chymotryptic cleavage.";
"Phosphoproteomic analysis of rat liver by high capacity IMAC and LC-
MS/MS.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in pH regulation to eliminate acids generated
    by active metabolism or to counter adverse environmental
    conditions. Major proton extruding system driven by the inward
    sodium ion chemical gradient. Plays an important role in signal
    transduction.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with tescalcin, CHP and CHP2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Not tissue specific.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (Possible).
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated and O-glycosylated in the N-terminal region.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (TC 2.A.36.5.1)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: The region between transmembrane regions M4 and M5 and
    between M6 and M7 (also termed intracellular loops IL2 and IL4,
    respectively) seem to be localized at least in part in the
    membrane. The hydrophobic region H10 is proposed to be located
    within the membrane.
