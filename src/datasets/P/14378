ATP synthase epsilon chain, sodium ion specific (EC 3.6.3.15) (Na(+)-
translocating ATPase epsilon subunit).
"Characterization of the genes coding for the F1F0 subunits of the
sodium dependent ATPase of Propionigenium modestum.";
"N-terminal amino acid sequences of the subunits of the Na(+)-
translocating F1F0 ATPase from Propionigenium modestum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a sodium
    gradient across the membrane.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O = ADP + phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The ATPase of P.modestum is of special interest
    because it uses sodium ions instead of protons as the
    physiological coupling ion.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase epsilon chain family.
