AC   P03961;
Potassium-transporting ATPase C chain (EC 3.6.3.12) (Potassium-
translocating ATPase C chain) (ATP phosphohydrolase [potassium-
transporting] C chain) (Potassium-binding and translocating subunit
C).
"Sequence homology between two membrane transport ATPases, the Kdp-
ATPase of Escherichia coli and the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic
reticulum.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"KdpD and KdpE, proteins that control expression of the kdpABC operon,
are members of the two-component sensor-effector class of
regulators.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the components of the high-affinity ATP-driven
    potassium transport (or KDP) system, which catalyzes the
    hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of hydrogen and
    potassium ions. The C subunit may be involved in assembly of the
    KDP complex.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + K(+)(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    K(+)(In).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the kdpC family.
