AC   P0A755; P31577; P75629;
Glutathione-regulated potassium-efflux system ancillary protein kefF.
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for full activity of kefC (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: It is unlikely that kefF has oxidoreductase
    activity, it has probably evolved from its function as
    oxidoreductase to be regulator of kefC.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) family.
    KefF subfamily.
 GO:0006813; P:potassium ion transport; IEA:HAMAP.
