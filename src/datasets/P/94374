AC   P75958;
Lipoprotein-releasing system transmembrane protein lolE.
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"A new ABC transporter mediating the detachment of lipid-modified
proteins from membranes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of an ATP-dependent transport system lolCDE
    responsible for the release of lipoproteins targeted to the outer
    membrane from the inner membrane. Such a release is dependent of
    the sorting-signal (absence of an Asp at position 2 of the mature
    lipoprotein) and of lolA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC-4 integral membrane protein family.
    LolC/E subfamily.
Complete proteome; Direct protein sequencing; Inner membrane;
