exports L-arabinose and isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside.";

proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the efflux of sugars. The physiological role
    may be the reduction of the intracellular concentration of toxic
    sugars or sugar metabolites. Transports L-arabinose and to a
    lesser extent IPTG. Seems to contribute to the control of the
    arabinose regulon.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. SotB
    (TC 2.A.1.2) family.
