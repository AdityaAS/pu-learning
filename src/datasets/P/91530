Type 4 prepilin-like proteins leader peptide-processing enzyme
(Protein secretion protein XCPA) (Protein pilD) [Includes: Leader

-!- FUNCTION: Cleaves type-4 fimbrial leader sequence and methylates
    the N-terminal (generally Phe) residue. Processes the pilin
    precursor during membrane translocation. Required for the assembly
    of type IV pili and for secretion of most proteins.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Typically cleaves a -Gly-|-Phe- bond to
    release an N-terminal, basic peptide of 5-8 residues from type IV
    prepilin, and then N-methylates the new N-terminal amino group,
    the methyl donor being S-adenosyl-L-methionine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase A24 family.
