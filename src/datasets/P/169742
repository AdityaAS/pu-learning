-!- FUNCTION: Part of the Sec61 complex, which is the major component
    of a channel-forming translocon complex that mediates protein
    translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The
    functional states of the translocon complex include co- and
    posttranslational ER import, cotranslational membrane protein
    integration and retrograde transport of misfolded proteins out of
    the ER. In the cotranslational pathway, ribosomes synthesizing
    presecretory proteins are targeted to the translocon by the
    cytosolic signal recognition particle (SRP) and its ER-localized
    receptor. The association of the Sec61 complex with the ribosome
    is mediated by the 28S rRNA of the large ribosomal subunit. SRP-
    independent posttranslational translocation requires the
    association of additional factors, such as the Sec62/63 complex
    and KAR2.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex, which is
    composed of SSH1, SBH1 and SSS1. Presumably three to four Sec61
    heterotrimers assemble into an oligomeric ring with a central
    aeqeous pore. In cotranslational ER import, the pore diameter
    varies from 9-15 A in a ribosome-free resting state to 40-60 A in
    a functional state when associated with the ribosome. The Sec61
    complex is part of a channel-forming translocon complex whose
    composition seem to change dependent upon different functional
    states. During posttranslational ER import the Sec61 complex
    associates with the Sec62/63 complex to form the Sec complex. SBH1
    interacts OST2, OST4 and WBP1 components of the OT complex.
