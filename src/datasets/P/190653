-!- FUNCTION: Reduces trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) into
    trimethylamine; an anaerobic reaction coupled to energy-yielding
    reactions.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Trimethylamine + 2 (ferricytochrome c)-subunit
    + H(2)O = trimethylamine N-oxide + 2 (ferrocytochrome c)-subunit +
    2 H(+).
-!- COFACTOR: Molybdenum (molybdopterin) (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with the N-terminal domain of torC.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- PTM: Exported by the Tat system. The position of the signal
    peptide cleavage has been experimentally proven.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family.
