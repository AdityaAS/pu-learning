AC   O33407; Q7DC45; Q9F3Y2;
Esterase estA precursor (EC 3.1.1.1).
"A novel lipolytic enzyme located in the outer membrane of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa.";
"Evolutionary origins of the autotransporter proteins.";
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A carboxylic ester + H(2)O = an alcohol + a
    carboxylate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains a C-terminal autotransporter domain that
    integrates into the outer membrane and enables the translocation
    of the catalytic N-terminal domain to the bacterial cell surface.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the "GDSL" lipolytic enzyme family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 autotransporter (TC 1.B.12) domain.
