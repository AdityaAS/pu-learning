AC   O06925;
Malonate decarboxylase acyl carrier protein (Malonate decarboxylase
delta subunit).
"Sequence of a gene cluster from Malonomonas rubra encoding components
of the malonate decarboxylase Na+ pump and evidence for their
function.";
"The acyl carrier protein of malonate decarboxylase of Malonomonas
rubra contains 2'-(5''-phosphoribosyl)-3'-dephosphocoenzyme A as a
prosthetic group.";
-!- FUNCTION: Subunit of malonate decarboxylase, it is an acyl carrier
    protein to which acetyl and malonyl thioester residues are bound
    via a 2'-(5''-phosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA prosthetic group
    and turn over during the catalytic mechanism.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- PTM: Covalently binds the prosthetic group of malonate
    decarboxylase.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mdcC family.
