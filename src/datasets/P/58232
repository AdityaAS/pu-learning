Tungsten-containing formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase 2 subunit C
(EC 1.2.99.5) (Tungsten-containing formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase II
subunit C).
"The tungsten formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase from Methanobacterium
thermoautotrophicum contains sequence motifs characteristic for
enzymes containing molybdopterin dinucleotide.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reversible oxidation of CO(2) and
    methanofuran (MFR) to N-formylmethanofuran (CHO-MFR). Can only
    oxidize formylmethanofuran. This enzyme is oxygen-labile.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Formylmethanofuran + H(2)O + acceptor = CO(2)
    + methanofuran + reduced acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Tungsten.
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis; first step.
-!- SUBUNIT: This enzyme is composed of seven subunits fwdA (65 kDa),
    fwdB (53 kDa), fwdC (31 kDa), fwdD (15 kDa), fwdE, fwdF and fwdG
    (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By growth on tungsten or molybdenum under anaerobic
    conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fwdC/fmdC family.
