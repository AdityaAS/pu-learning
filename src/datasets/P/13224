-!- FUNCTION: This is the smallest of the 5 chains of the enzymatic
    component (coupling factor CF(1)) of the mitochondrial ATPase
    complex.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 4280 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eukaryotic ATPase epsilon family.
