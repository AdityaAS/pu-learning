AC   Q07227;
Gamma-hemolysin component C precursor (H-gamma-1) (H-gamma-I).
"The gamma-hemolysin locus of Staphylococcus aureus comprises three
linked genes, two of which are identical to the genes for the F and S
components of leukocidin.";
"Molecular cloning and genetic analysis of the determinant for gamma-
lysin, a two-component toxin of Staphylococcus aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Toxin that seems to act by forming pores in the membrane
    of the cell. Has a hemolytic and a leucotoxic activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Toxicity requires sequential binding and synergistic
    association of a class S and a class F component which form
    heterooligomeric complexes. HlgC (class S) associates with hlgB
    (class F) thus forming an CB toxin.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aerolysin family.
