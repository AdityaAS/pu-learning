Glycolate permease glcA.
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"The gene yghK linked to the glc operon of Escherichia coli encodes a
permease for glycolate that is structurally and functionally similar
to L-lactate permease.";
"Transport of L-lactate, D-lactate, and glycolate by the LldP and GlcA
membrane carriers of Escherichia coli.";
"Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transports glycolate across the membrane. Can also
    transport L-lactate and D-lactate. Seems to be driven by a proton
    motive force.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-
    chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By glycolate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lactate permease family.
