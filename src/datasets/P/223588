Inner membrane amino-acid ABC transporter permease protein yecS.
"A 460-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 40.1-50.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably part of the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system yecCS for an amino acid; probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. HisMQ subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
