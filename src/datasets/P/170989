AC   P46249; Q9MD55;
Preprotein translocase secY subunit.
"A model for the evolution of the plastid sec apparatus inferred from
secY gene phylogeny.";
"The structure and gene repertoire of an ancient red algal plastid
genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export. Probably interacts with
    other proteins to allow the translocation of proteins across the
    chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum (CER) membranes.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secY/SEC61-alpha family.
