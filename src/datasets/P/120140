AC   P47824;
P2X purinoceptor 1 (ATP receptor) (P2X1) (Purinergic receptor) (RP-2
protein).
"A new class of ligand-gated ion channel defined by P2x receptor for
extracellular ATP.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Identification of mRNAs associated with programmed cell death in
immature thymocytes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Ligand gated ion channel with relatively high calcium
    permeability. Binding to ATP mediates synaptic transmission
    between neurons and from neurons to smooth muscle. Seems to be
    linked to apoptosis, by increasing the intracellular concentration
    of calcium in the presence of ATP, leading to programmed cell
    death.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homo- or heteropolymers.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: High levels in vas deferens and urinary
    bladder. Lower extent in spinal cord, coeliac ganglion, lung and
    spleen (probably in the smooth muscle part of both organs).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed during apoptosis in thymocytes.
-!- INDUCTION: By irradiation and dexamethasone (in thymocytes).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the P2X receptor family.
