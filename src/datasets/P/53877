enterobactin transport system: homology to other periplasmic binding
protein-dependent systems in Escherichia coli.";

-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for ferric enterobactin. Probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Controlled in part by the amount of available iron.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. FecCD subfamily.
