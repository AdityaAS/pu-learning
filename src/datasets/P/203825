Protein virB4 precursor.
"Characterization of the virB operon from an Agrobacterium tumefaciens
Ti plasmid.";
-!- FUNCTION: A possible function of virB4 might be to provide the
    energy, via hydrolysis of ATP, for translocation of virulence
    proteins of the transfer of a T-DNA-protein complex across the
    agrobacterium membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: To A.tumefaciens trbE.
