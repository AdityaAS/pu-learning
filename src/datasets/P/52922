Long-chain fatty acid transport protein precursor (Outer membrane fadL
protein) (Outer membrane flp protein).
"Primary sequence of the Escherichia coli fadL gene encoding an outer
membrane protein required for long-chain fatty acid transport.";
"Construction of a contiguous 874-kb sequence of the Escherichia coli-
K12 genome corresponding to 50.0-68.8 min on the linkage map and
analysis of its sequence features.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Nucleotide sequencing and expression of the fadL gene involved in
long-chain fatty acid transport in Escherichia coli.";

"Crystal structure of the long-chain fatty acid transporter FadL.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in translocation of long-chain fatty acids
    across the outer membrane. It is a receptor for the bacteriophage
    T2. FadL may form a specific channel.
-!- SUBUNIT: Has been isolated from outer membrane preparation as a
    homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By long-chain fatty acids. Expression of fadL is under
    the control of the fadR repressor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ompP1/fadL family.
