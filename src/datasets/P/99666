AC   P40260;
Ammonium transporter MEP1.
"Cloning and expression of the MEP1 gene encoding an ammonium
transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"An 18.3 kb DNA fragment from yeast chromosome VII carries four
unknown open reading frames, the gene for an Asn synthase, remnants of
Ty and three tRNA genes.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII.";
"A global topology map of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transporter for ammonium to use as a nitrogen source.
    Can also transport methylamine. The affinity of MEP1 is about
    twenty times lower than that of MEP2.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P40582:GTT1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-10714, EBI-7941;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ammonium transporter (TC 2.A.49)
    family.
