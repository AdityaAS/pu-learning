AC   Q59584;
Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase subunit B (EC 2.1.1.86)
(N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin--coenzyme M methyltransferase
subunit B).
"Cloning, sequencing and immunological characterization of the
corrinoid-containing subunit of the N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin:
coenzyme-M methyltransferase from Methanobacterium
thermoautotrophicum.";
"The energy conserving N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin:coenzyme M
methyltransferase complex from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum is
composed of eight different subunits.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a complex that catalyzes the formation of
    methyl-coenzyme M and tetrahydromethanopterin from coenzyme M and
    methyl-tetrahydromethanopterin. This is an energy-conserving,
    sodium-ion translocating step.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin + 2-
    mercaptoethanesulfonate = 5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin + 2-
    (methylthio)ethanesulfonate.
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis from carbon dioxide; sixth step.
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of 8 subunits; mtrA, mtrB, mtrC,
    mtrD, mtrE, mtrF, mtrG and mtrH.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mtrB family.
