AC   P17064;
Purine-cytosine permease FCY2 (PCP FCY2) (Cytosine/purine transport
protein FCY2) (Fluorocytosine resistance protein 2).
"The purine-cytosine permease gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae:
primary structure and deduced protein sequence of the FCY2 gene
product.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome V.";
"Repeated DNA sequences upstream from HIS1 also occur at several other
co-regulated genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"The immunodetected yeast purine-cytosine permease is not N-linked
glycosylated, nor are glycosylation sequences required to have a
functional permease.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
"Quantitative phosphoproteomics applied to the yeast pheromone
signaling pathway.";
"A global topology map of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: This permease has a broad specificity towards purines,
    and also transport cytosine and 5-methylcytosine but neither
    uracil nor thymine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- PTM: Not N-glycosylated.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 23600 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the purine-cytosine permease family.
