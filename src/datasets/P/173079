-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity manganese transporter involved in
    manganese uptake from the extracellular environment. Contributes
    also to cellular accumulation of other divalent metal ions such as
    cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron and nickel.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Note=Targeted to the vacuolar lumen in presence of excess
    manganese, where it is degraded.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NRAMP family.
