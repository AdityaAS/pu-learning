AC   P23564;
Alveolysin precursor (Thiol-activated cytolysin).
"Alveolysin, the thiol-activated toxin of Bacillus alvei, is
homologous to listeriolysin O, perfringolysin O, pneumolysin, and
streptolysin O and contains a single cysteine.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sulfhydryl-activated toxin. Is able to lyse cholesterol
    containing membranes. Can be reversibly inactivated by oxidation.
    Cholesterol is the receptor for the binding of these toxins to
    eukaryotic cell membranes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the thiol-activated cytolysin family.
