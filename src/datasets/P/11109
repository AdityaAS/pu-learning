-!- FUNCTION: Permease that is involved in the transport across the
    cytoplasmic membrane of the aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine,
    tyrosine, and tryptophan).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Its activity is regulated by protein tyrR.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. Amino acid transporter (AAT) (TC 2.A.3.1) family.
