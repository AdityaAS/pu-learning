-!- FUNCTION: Specifically required for the degradation process of
    misfolded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal proteins. Probably
    participates in the transfer of misfolded proteins from the ER to
    the cytosol, where they are destroyed by the proteasome in a
    ubiquitin-dependent manner.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Up-regulated by the unfolded protein response (UPR).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 238 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the derlin family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 40.
