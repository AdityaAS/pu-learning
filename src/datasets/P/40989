D-galactose-binding periplasmic protein precursor (GBP) (D-galactose/
D-glucose-binding protein) (GGBP).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is involved in the active transport of
    galactose and glucose. It plays a role in the chemotaxis towards
    the two sugars by interacting with the trg chemoreceptor (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The calcium-binding site is structurally similar to that
    of EF-hand proteins, but is in two parts, with the last calcium
    ligand provided by Glu-228 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 2
    family.
