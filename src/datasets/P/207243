-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in sodium-dependent transport of neutral
    amino acids or oligopeptides.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: High levels in skeletal muscle, heart, brain,
    and pancreas; low levels in placenta, lung, liver, and kidney.
-!- PTM: Not glycosylated.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: XK is responsible for the Kx blood group system.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in XK are the cause of McLeod syndrome (MLS)
    [MIM:314850]. It is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized
    by late onset abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic
    systems.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the XK family.
