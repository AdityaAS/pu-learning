Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 3
(TrpV3) (Vanilloid receptor-like 3) (VRL-3).
"TRPV3 is a temperature-sensitive vanilloid receptor-like protein.";
"TRPV3 is a calcium-permeable temperature-sensitive cation channel.";
"Human TRPV3, a new member of the vanilloid receptor family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Putative receptor-activated non-selective calcium
    permeant cation channel. It is activated by innocuous (warm)
    temperatures and shows an increased response at noxious
    temperatures greater than 39 degrees Celsius. Activation exhibits
    an outward rectification. May associate with TRPV1 and may
    modulate its activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: May form a heteromeric channel with TRPV1. Interacts with
    TRPV1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Abundantly expressed in CNS. Widely expressed
    at low levels. Detected in dorsal root ganglion (at protein
    level).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. TrpV
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 ANK repeats.
