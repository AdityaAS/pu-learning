AC   P76173; P77142;
Anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase chain ynfH (DMSO reductase
anchor subunit ynfH).
"A 570-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 28.0-40.1 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
-!- FUNCTION: Terminal reductase during anaerobic growth on various
    sulfoxide and N-oxide compounds. The C subunit anchors the other
    two subunits to the membrane and stabilize the catalytic subunits
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex consist of three subunits: ynfF, the
    reductase; ynfG, an electron transfer protein, and ynfH, a
    membrane anchor protein (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: To E.coli dmsC.
