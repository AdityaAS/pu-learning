AC   P26435;
Sodium/bile acid cotransporter (Na(+)/bile acid cotransporter)
(Na(+)/taurocholate transport protein) (Sodium/taurocholate
cotransporting polypeptide) (Solute carrier family 10 member 1).
"Functional expression cloning and characterization of the hepatocyte
Na+/bile acid cotransport system.";
-!- FUNCTION: The hepatic sodium/bile acid uptake system exhibits
    broad substrate specificity and transports various non-bile acid
    organic compounds as well. It is strictly dependent on the
    extracellular presence of sodium.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Liver and kidney.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:bile acid symporter family.
