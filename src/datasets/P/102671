AC   P28612;
Chemotaxis protein motB (Motility protein B).
"An operon of Bacillus subtilis motility genes transcribed by the
sigma D form of RNA polymerase.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the rotation of the flagellar motor. Might
    be a linker that fastens the torque-generating machinery to the
    cell wall.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the motB family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 OmpA-like domain.
