Signal recognition particle receptor subunit alpha homolog (SR-alpha)
(Docking protein alpha) (DP-alpha).
"Signal recognition particle receptor is important for cell growth and
protein secretion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IV.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Ensures, in conjunction with SRP, the correct targeting
    of the nascent secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane system. GTP hydrolysis may enhance the fidelity of and
    provide unidirectionality to the targeting reaction. It is
    important but not essential for cell growth. May be directly
    involved in mitochondrial protein import.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta chain.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P36057:SRP102; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-18098, EBI-18091;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 2000 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GTP-binding SRP family.
