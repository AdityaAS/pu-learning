SPBc2 prophage-derived sublancin 168 processing and transport ATP-
binding protein sunT (EC 3.4.22.-).
"Identification and characterization of the structural and transporter
genes for, and the chemical and biological properties of, sublancin
168, a novel lantibiotic produced by Bacillus subtilis 168.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases are essential for the production of
the lantibiotic sublancin 168.";
-!- FUNCTION: SunT (TC 3.A.1.112.4) is required for production of the
    lantibiotic sublancin 168, probably by both processing the signal
    peptide and exporting the resulting mature lantibiotic.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. SunT subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase C39 domain.
