AC   P0ABJ2; P18400;
Ubiquinol oxidase subunit 2 precursor (EC 1.10.3.-) (Ubiquinol oxidase
polypeptide II) (Cytochrome o subunit 2) (Oxidase BO(3) subunit 2)
(Cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit 2) (Ubiquinol oxidase chain
B).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex is the component
    of the aerobic respiratory chain that predominates when cells are
    grown at high aeration (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Ubiquinol-8 + O(2) = Ubiquinone-8 + H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooctamer of two A chains, two B chains, two C chains
    and two D chains (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 family.
