-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex cysAWTP
    (TC 3.A.1.6.1) involved in sulfate/thiosulfate import. Probably
    responsible for the translocation of the substrate across the
    membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (cysA), two transmembrane proteins (cysT and cysW) and a solute-
    binding protein (cysP) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. CysTW subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
