AC   Q07396;
Electron transport complex protein rnfA (Nitrogen fixation protein
rnfA).
"Identification of a new class of nitrogen fixation genes in
Rhodobacter capsulatus: a putative membrane complex involved in
electron transport to nitrogenase.";
"Nucleotide sequence and genetic analysis of the region essential for
functional expression of the gene for ferredoxin I, fdxN, in
Rhodobacter capsulatus: sharing of one upstream activator sequence in
opposite directions by two operons related to nitrogen fixation.";

"Membrane localization, topology, and mutual stabilization of the
rnfABC gene products in Rhodobacter capsulatus and implications for a
new family of energy-coupling NADH oxidoreductases.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for nitrogen fixation. May be part of a
    membrane complex functioning as an intermediate in the electron
    transport to nitrogenase. Required for stable existence of rnfB
    and rnfC.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of at least six subunits; rnfA, rnfB, rnfC,
    rnfD, rnfE and rnfG.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Expression is reduced under iron-limiting conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nqrDE/rnfAE family.
