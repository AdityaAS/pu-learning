AC   P15710; Q7RV96;
Phosphate-repressible phosphate permease.
"Nucleotide sequence of pho-4+, encoding a phosphate-repressible
phosphate permease of Neurospora crassa.";
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: When the organism is grown under conditions of limiting
    phosphorus, a number of derepressible enzymes are synthesized that
    are necessary for scavenging phosphorus from the environment.
    These include this high-affinity phosphate permease, which is part
    of a functional entity called ptsII. Probably a sodium-phosphate
    symporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pho-4 transporter (TC 2.A.20.2.1)
    family.
