AC   Q8NFU1; Q53YQ8; Q9NXP0;
Bestrophin-2 (Vitelliform macular dystrophy 2-like protein 1).
"Three novel human VMD2-like genes are members of the evolutionary
highly conserved RFP-TM family.";
"Structure-function analysis of the bestrophin family of anion
channels.";
"Complete sequencing and characterization of 21,243 full-length human
cDNAs.";
"The vitelliform macular dystrophy protein defines a new family of
chloride channels.";
-!- FUNCTION: Forms calcium-sensitive chloride channels. May conduct
    other physiologically significant anions such as bicarbonate (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Mainly confined to the retinal pigment
    epithelium and colon.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bestrophin family.
