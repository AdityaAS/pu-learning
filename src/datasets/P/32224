AC   Q800R2; P56226;
Caerin-1.1 precursor [Contains: Caerin-1.1.1; Caerin-1.1.2; Caerin-
1.1.4].
"Antimicrobial peptides from hylid and ranin frogs originated from a
150-million-year-old ancestral precursor with a conserved signal
peptide but a hypermutable antimicrobial domain.";
"Peptides from Australian frogs. The structures of the caerins from
Litoria caerula.";
-!- FUNCTION: Antibacterial and antiviral peptides that adopt an alpha
    helical conformation which can disrupt bacterial membranes. Each
    caerin displays a different antimicrobial specificity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Secreted by the skin parotoid and/or rostral
    glands.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains two amphipathic alpha helix regions separated by
    a region of less-defined helicity and greater flexibility.
-!- PTM: The major product is Caerin-1.1; in addition, different
    peptides are produced that are missing some amino acid residues at
    the N-terminus or C-terminus. Caerin-1.1.1 and Caerin-1.1.4 are
    inactive.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2582; METHOD=FAB; RANGE=50-74; NOTE=Ref.2.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2412; METHOD=FAB; RANGE=52-74; NOTE=Ref.2.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2299; METHOD=FAB; RANGE=53-74; NOTE=Ref.2.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2333; METHOD=FAB; RANGE=50-72; NOTE=Ref.2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the frog skin active peptide (FSAP) family.
    Caerin subfamily.
