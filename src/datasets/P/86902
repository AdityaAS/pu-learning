AC   O14649;
Potassium channel subfamily K member 3 (Acid-sensitive potassium
channel protein TASK-1) (TWIK-related acid-sensitive K(+) channel 1)
(Two pore potassium channel KT3.1).
"TASK, a human background K+ channel to sense external pH variations
near physiological pH.";
"Proton block and voltage-gating are potassium-dependent in the
cardiac leak channel Kcnk3.";
"Inhalational anesthetics activate two-pore-domain background K+
channels.";
"TASK-5, a novel member of the tandem pore K+ channel family.";
-!- FUNCTION: pH-dependent, voltage-insensitive, background potassium
    channel protein. Rectification direction results from potassium
    ion concentration on either side of the membrane. Acts as an
    outward rectifier when external potassium concentration is low.
    When external potassium concentration is high, current is inward.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widespread expression in adult. Strongest
    expression in pancreas and placenta. Lower expression in brain,
    lung, prostate, heart, kidney, uterus, small intestine and colon.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibited by external acidification. Activated by
    halothane and isoflurane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the two pore domain potassium channel
    (TC 1.A.1.8) family.
