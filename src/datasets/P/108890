AC   P44308;
Transcriptional regulator nadR.
"Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae
Rd.";
-!- FUNCTION: NadR is bifunctional; it interacts with pnuC at low
    internal NAD levels, permitting transport of NMN intact into the
    cell. As NAD levels increase within the cell, the affinity of nadR
    for the operator regions of some genes increases, repressing the
    transcription of these genes (By similarity).
