-!- FUNCTION: This protein may be involved in the regulation of B-cell
    activation and proliferation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed on B-cells.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated. Might be functionally regulated by protein
    kinase(s).
-!- PHARMACEUTICAL: Monoclonal antibodies against CD20 are used to
    treat people who have B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Various
    forms of the antibody are known as Rituximab (Mabthera),
    Britumomab (Zevalin) and Tositumomab (Bexxar).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MS4A family.
