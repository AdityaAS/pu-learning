AC   O32273;
Teichuronic acid biosynthesis protein tuaB.
"Teichuronic acid operon of Bacillus subtilis 168.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Might be involved in the translocation of teichuronic
    acid repeating units from the inner to the outer surface of the
    membrane.
-!- PATHWAY: Teichuronic acid biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: By phosphate starvation, via the phoP/phoR two-
    component regulatory system.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The nature of the anionic polymer present in the
    cell wall of B.subtilis depends on phosphate availability. Under
    phosphate-replete growth conditions teichoic acids are present,
    whereas under phosphate-depleted conditions, at least part of the
    wall teichoic acid is replaced with teichuronic acid, a non-
    phosphate containing anionic polymer. The synthesis of teichuronic
    acid is accompanied by degradation of teichoic acid and
    reutilization of liberated phosphate for other cellular processes
    such as nucleic acid synthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the polysaccharide synthase family.
