NADH-quinone oxidoreductase chain 2 (EC 1.6.99.5) (NADH dehydrogenase
I, chain 2) (NDH-1, chain 2).
"Characterization of the 25-kilodalton subunit of the energy-
transducing NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase of Paracoccus
denitrificans: sequence similarity to the 24-kilodalton subunit of the
flavoprotein fraction of mammalian complex I.";
"Identification of amino acid residues associated with the [2Fe-2S]
cluster of the 25 kDa (NQO2) subunit of the proton-translocating NADH-
quinone oxidoreductase of Paracoccus denitrificans.";
-!- FUNCTION: NDH-1 shuttles electrons from NADH, via FMN and iron-
    sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the respiratory chain. The
    immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is
    believed to be ubiquinone. Couples the redox reaction to proton
    translocation (for every two electrons transferred, four hydrogen
    ions are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus
    conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + quinone = NAD(+) + quinol.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster (Potential).
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of 14 different subunits.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I 24 kDa subunit family.
