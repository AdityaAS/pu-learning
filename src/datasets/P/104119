AC   P60753; P27299;
Lipid A export ATP-binding/permease protein msbA (EC 3.6.3.-).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in lipid A export and possibly also in
    glycerophospholipid export and for biogenesis of the outer
    membrane. Transmembrane domains (TMD) form a pore in the inner
    membrane and the ATP-binding domain (NBD) is responsible for
    energy generation (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: In msbA the ATP-binding domain (NBD) and the transmembrane
    domain (TMD) are fused.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Lipid exporter
    (TC 3.A.1.106) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
