Lantibiotic epidermin precursor.
"Prepeptide sequence of epidermin, a ribosomally synthesized
antibiotic with four sulphide-rings.";
"Analysis of genes involved in the biosynthesis of lantibiotic
epidermin.";
"Crystal structure of the peptidyl-cysteine decarboxylase EpiD
complexed with a pentapeptide substrate.";
-!- FUNCTION: Lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic)
    active on Gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal activity of
    lantibiotics is based on depolarization of energized bacterial
    cytoplasmic membranes, initiated by the formation of aqueous
    transmembrane pores.
-!- PTM: Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of
    Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether
    bonds with cysteine. The C-terminal lanthionine undergoes
    decarboxylation. This is followed by membrane translocation and
    cleavage of the modified precursor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type A lantibiotic family.
