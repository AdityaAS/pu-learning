-!- FUNCTION: Acyl-CoA synthetase probably involved in bile acid
    metabolism. Proposed to activate C27 precurors of bile acids to
    their CoA thioesters derivatives before side chain cleavage via
    peroxisomal beta-oxidation occurs. In vitro, activates 3-alpha,7-
    alpha,12-alpha-trihydroxy-5-beta-cholestanate (THCA), the C27
    precursor of cholic acid deriving from the de novo synthesis from
    cholesterol. Does not utilize C24 bile acids as substrates. In
    vitro, also activates long- and branched-chain fatty acids and may
    have additional roles in fatty acid metabolism. May be involved in
    translocation of long-chain fatty acids (LFCA) across membranes
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a long-chain carboxylic acid + CoA = AMP
    + diphosphate + an acyl-CoA.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a very-long-chain carboxylic acid + CoA
    = AMP + diphosphate + an acyl-CoA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Peroxisome; peroxisomal
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Note=Peripheral membrane
    associated with the lumenal side of peroxisomes.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in liver, kidney, placenta and
    pancreas.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATP-dependent AMP-binding enzyme
    family.
