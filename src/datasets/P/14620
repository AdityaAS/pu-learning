-!- FUNCTION: Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton
    gradient across the membrane. The gamma chain is believed to be
    important in regulating ATPase activity and the flow of protons
    through the CF(0) complex.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0ACC1:hemK; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-544306, EBI-1122814;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase gamma chain family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 sequence differs from that shown due to frameshifts
    and various other errors.
