AC   Q8ZRP7; Q9ZFP9;
Vitamin B12-binding protein precursor.
"A new class of cobalamin transport mutants (btuF) provides genetic
evidence for a periplasmic binding protein in Salmonella
typhimurium.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex btuCDF involved in
    vitamin B12 import. Binds vitamin B12 and delivers it to the
    periplasmic surface of btuC (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (btuD), two transmembrane proteins (btuC) and a solute-binding
    protein (btuF) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the btuF family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Fe/B12 periplasmic-binding domain.
