AC   P53007; Q9BSK6;
Tricarboxylate transport protein, mitochondrial precursor (Citrate
transport protein) (CTP) (Tricarboxylate carrier protein) (Solute
carrier family 25 member 1).
"Localization of the human mitochondrial citrate transporter protein
gene to chromosome 22q11 in the DiGeorge syndrome critical region.";
"Cloning, genomic organization, and chromosomal localization of human
citrate transport protein to the DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome
minimal critical region.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in citrate-H+/malate exchange. Important for
    the bioenergetics of hepatic cells as it provides a carbon source
    for fatty acid and sterol biosyntheses, and NAD+ for the
    glycolytic pathway.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
