AC   P36640;
Magnesium-transporting ATPase, P-type 1 (EC 3.6.3.2) (Mg(2+) transport
ATPase, P-type 1).
"Magnesium transport in Salmonella typhimurium: mgtA encodes a P-type
ATPase and is regulated by Mg2+ in a manner similar to that of the
mgtB P-type ATPase.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates magnesium influx to the cytosol.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Mg(2+)(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    Mg(2+)(In).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IIIB subfamily.
