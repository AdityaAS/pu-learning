AC   P17551; Q1L9W5; Q5NV00;
Chromate transport protein.
"Nucleotide sequence and expression of a plasmid-encoded chromate
resistance determinant from Alcaligenes eutrophus.";
"Sequence and features of the Ralstonia metallidurans CH34 heavy metal
plasmids pMOL28 and pMOL30.";
"Complete sequence of plasmid pMOL28 of Ralstonia metallidurans
CH34.";
"New genes involved in chromate resistance in Ralstonia metallidurans
strain CH34.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein reduces chromate accumulation and is
    essential for chromate resistance.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: By chromate; induction increases when cells are grown
    in the presence of high sulfate concentrations (3 mM SO4(2-)).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chromate ion transporter (CHR)
    (TC 2.A.51) family.
