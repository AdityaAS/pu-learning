AC   P49856;
Multidrug resistance protein ykkC.
"Oxygen-controlled regulation of the flavohemoglobin gene in Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Sequence of the Bacillus subtilis genome between xlyA and ykoR.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"A broad-specificity multidrug efflux pump requiring a pair of
homologous SMR-type proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a multidrug efflux pump. Confers resistance to a
    broad range of toxic compounds such as cationic dyes, neutral and
    anionic antimicrobials.
-!- SUBUNIT: The efflux pump is composed of ykkC and ykkD (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small multidrug resistance (SMR)
    protein family. YkkC/ykkD (TC 2.A.7.1.5) subfamily.
Antibiotic resistance; Complete proteome; Membrane; Transmembrane;
Transport.
