AC   Q00325; Q96A03;
Phosphate carrier protein, mitochondrial precursor (PTP) (Solute
carrier family 25 member 3).
"The sequences of human and bovine genes of the phosphate carrier from
mitochondria contain evidence of alternatively spliced forms.";
"Nucleotide sequence of a human heart cDNA encoding the mitochondrial
phosphate carrier.";
"Identification of immuno-peptidmics that are recognized by tumor-
reactive CTL generated from TIL of colon cancer patients.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Transport of phosphate groups from the cytosol to the
    mitochondrial matrix. Phosphate is cotransported with H(+).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=A;
      IsoId=Q00325-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=B;
      IsoId=Q00325-2; Sequence=VSP_003269;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
