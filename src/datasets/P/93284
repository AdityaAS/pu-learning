lipopolysaccharide.";

Rd.";
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a glycolipid that is a
    necessary component and antigenic determinant of the outer
    membrane and has been shown to be an important factor in the host-
    parasite interaction in a number of Gram-negative species.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: H.influenzae is able to display an extensive
    repertoire of different surface configurations through variability
    of its LPS oligosaccharide.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 DUF6 domains.
