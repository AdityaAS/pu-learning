AC   P21410;
Ferric cations import ATP-binding protein fbpC (EC 3.6.3.30).
"Nucleotide sequences of the sfuA, sfuB, and sfuC genes of Serratia
marcescens suggest a periplasmic-binding-protein-dependent iron
transport mechanism.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex fbpABC involved in
    Fe(3+) ions import. Responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Fe(3+)(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    Fe(3+)(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (fbpC), two transmembrane proteins (fbpB) and a solute-binding
    protein (fbpA) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Fe(3+) ion
    importer (TC 3.A.1.10) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
