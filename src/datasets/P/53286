Iron-utilization periplasmic protein precursor (Major ferric iron-
binding protein) (Iron-regulated 40 kDa protein) (MIRP) (Fe(3+)-
binding protein).

-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex fbpABC
    (TC 3.A.1.10.1) involved in Fe(3+) ions import. This protein
    specifically binds Fe(3+) and is involved in its transmembrane
    transport (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (fbpC), two transmembrane proteins (fbpB) and a solute-binding
    protein (fbpA) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: By iron deprivation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 1
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 14.
