-!- FUNCTION: Could be involved in the transport of tyrosine, the
    precursor to melanin synthesis, within the melanocyte. Regulates
    the pH of melanosome and the melanosome maturation. One of the
    components of the mammalian pigmentary system. Seems to regulate
    the postranslational processing of tyrosinase, which catalyzes the
    limiting reaction in melanin synthesis. May serve as a key control
    point at which ethnic skin color variation is determined. Major
    determinant of brown and/or blue eye color.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Melanosome; melanosomal membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.

-!- DISEASE: Defects in OCA2 are the cause of oculocutaneous albinism
    type II (OCA2) [MIM:203200, 203310]. OCA2 is an autosomal
    recessive form of albinism, a disorder of pigmentation in the
    skin, hair, and eyes. The phenotype of patients with OCA2 is
    typically somewhat less severe than in those with tyrosinase-
    deficient OCA1. There are several forms of OCA2, from typical OCA
    to relatively mild 'autosomal recessive ocular albinism' (AROA).
    OCA2 is the most prevalent type of albinism throughout the world.
-!- DISEASE: The gene OCA2 is localized to chromosome 15 at 15q11.2-
    q12, a region associated with Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes,
    suggesting that altered expression of the OCA2 gene may be
    responsible for the hypopygmentation phenotype exhibited by
    certain individuals with these disorders.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC13A transporter (TC 2.A.47) family.
    P subfamily.
