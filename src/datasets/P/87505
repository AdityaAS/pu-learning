AC   P0A757; P45534;
Glutathione-regulated potassium-efflux system ancillary protein kefG.
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for full activity of kefB (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: It is unlikely that kefG has oxidoreductase
    activity, it has probably evolved from its function as
    oxidoreductase to be regulator of kefB.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) family.
    KefG subfamily.
 GO:0006813; P:potassium ion transport; IEA:HAMAP.
