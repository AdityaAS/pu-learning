-!- FUNCTION: Required for release of calcium ions from the vacuole in
    response to hyperosmotic shock.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1310 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (CAA64009) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 245.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (CAA99282) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 245.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (CAA99283) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 245.
