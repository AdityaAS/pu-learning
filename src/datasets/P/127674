Pleurocidin precursor.
"Cloning and developmental expression of a family of pleurocidin-like
antimicrobial peptides from winter flounder, Pleuronectes americanus
(Walbaum).";
"Identification, structure and differential expression of novel
pleurocidins clustered on the genome of the winter flounder,
Pseudopleuronectes americanus (Walbaum).";
"Isolation and characterization of pleurocidin, an antimicrobial
peptide in the skin secretions of winter flounder.";
-!- FUNCTION: Antimicrobial peptide with potent activity against Gram-
    positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Activity against E.coli and
    B.subtilis. Weaker activity against L.mucor, s.marcescens and
    P.aeruginosa. May play a role in innate host defense.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Goblet cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pleurocidin family.
