-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in forming the receptor site for cardiac
    glycoside binding or may modulate the transport function of the
    sodium ATPase.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of three subunits: alpha (catalytic), beta and
    gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type III membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1; Synonyms=A;
      IsoId=P54710-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2; Synonyms=B;
      IsoId=P54710-2; Sequence=VSP_001580;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the distal convoluted tubule in
    the kidney. Found on basolateral membranes of nephron epithelial
    cells.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in FXYD2 are a cause of dominant renal
    hypomagnesemia (HOMG2) [MIM:154020].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FXYD family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 12.
