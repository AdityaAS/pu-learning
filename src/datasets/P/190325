AC   P0A857; P19935;
Protein tolB precursor.
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the tonB-independent uptake of group A
    colicins (colicins A, E1, E2, E3 and K). Necessary for the
    colicins to reach their respective targets after initial binding
    to the bacteria (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tolB family.
