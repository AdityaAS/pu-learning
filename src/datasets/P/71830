(EC 1.8.98.1).
"Heterodisulfide reductase from methanol-grown cells of Methanosarcina
barkeri is not a flavoenzyme.";
"The Methanosarcina barkeri genome: comparative analysis with
Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanosarcina mazei reveals extensive
rearrangement within methanosarcinal genomes.";
"Purification of a two-subunit cytochrome-b-containing heterodisulfide
reductase from methanol-grown Methanosarcina barkeri.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a complex that catalyzes the reversible
    reduction of CoM-S-S-CoB to the thiol-coenzymes H-S-CoM (coenzyme
    M) and H-S-CoB (coenzyme B). HdrD may act as the catalytic
    subunit.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Coenzyme B + coenzyme M + methanophenazine =
    N-(7-((2-sulfoethyl)dithio)heptanoyl)-3-O-phospho-L-threonine +
    dihydromethanophenazine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 4Fe-4S clusters per subunit.
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis from acetate; sixth (last) step.
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis from carbon dioxide; eighth (last) step.
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis from methanol; third (last) step.
-!- SUBUNIT: The heterodisulfide reductase is composed of two
    subunits; hdrD and hdrE.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hdrD family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
