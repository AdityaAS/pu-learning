"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"thiBPQ encodes an ABC transporter required for transport of thiamine
and thiamine pyrophosphate in Salmonella typhimurium.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    tbpA-thiPQ for thiamine and TPP. Probably responsible for energy
    coupling to the transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
