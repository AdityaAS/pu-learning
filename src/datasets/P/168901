-!- FUNCTION: Plays a crucial role in the insertion of secretory and
    membrane polypeptides into the ER. Required for assembly of
    membrane and secretory proteins. Tightly associated with membrane-
    bound ribosomes, either directly or through adapter proteins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimeric complex composed of SEC61-alpha, SEC61-
    beta and SEC61-gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
