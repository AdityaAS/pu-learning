AC   Q9EPZ7;
Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1C1 (Solute
carrier family 21 member 14) (Blood-brain barrier-specific anion
transporter 1) (BBB-specific anion transporter type 1).
"Blood-brain barrier genomics.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the Na(+)-independent high affinity transport
    of organic anions such as the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and
    rT3. Other potential substrates, such as triiodothyronine (T3),
    17-beta-glucuronosyl estradiol, estrone-3-sulfate and
    sulfobromophthalein (BSP) are transported with much lower
    efficiency (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in brain capillaries. Brain-
    specific. Not detected in glioma cells, kidney, heart, lung or
    liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the organo anion transporter (TC 2.A.60)
    family.
