F(420)H(2) oxidoreductase subunit H (F(420)H(2) dehydrogenase subunit
H) (FPO subunit H).
"The F(420)H(2) dehydrogenase from Methanosarcina mazei is a redox-
driven proton pump closely related to NADH dehydrogenases.";

transfer between Bacteria and Archaea.";
"Purification and properties of an F(420)H(2) dehydrogenase from
Methanosarcina mazei Go1.";
-!- FUNCTION: FPO shuttles electrons from F(420)H(2), via FAD and
    iron-sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the
    F(420)H(2):heterodisulfide oxidoreduction chain. The immediate
    electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is believed to be
    methanophenazine. Couples the redox reaction to proton
    translocation (for every two electrons transferred, 0.9 hydrogen
    ions are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus
    conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: FPO is composed of at least 12 different subunits.
    Subunits fpoA, H, J, K, L, M, N constitute the membrane sector of
    the complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I subunit 1 family.
