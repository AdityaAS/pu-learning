Large-conductance mechanosensitive channel.
"The Bacillus subtilis genome from gerBC (311 degrees) to licR (334
degrees).";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Channel that opens in response to stretch forces in the
    membrane lipid bilayer. May participate in the regulation of
    osmotic pressure changes within the cell (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homopentamer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mscL family.
