-!- FUNCTION: This magnesium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis
    of ATP coupled with the transport of the sodium or lithium ions to
    allow salt tolerance. Is negatively modulated by SIS2/HAL3.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Na(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    Na(+)(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By sodium ions. Induction at low salt concentrations
    (0.3 M) is mediated by the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG)-MAP
    kinase pathway, a system activated by non-specific osmotic stress,
    and by the protein kinase A pathway. At high salt concentrations
    (0.8 M) is mediated by the protein phosphatase calcineurin, which
    is specifically activated by sodium ions.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 688 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IID subfamily.
