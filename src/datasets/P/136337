AC   O32139;
Uric acid permease pucJ.
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Functional analysis of 14 genes that constitute the purine catabolic
pathway in Bacillus subtilis and evidence for a novel regulon
controlled by the PucR transcription activator.";
-!- FUNCTION: Uptake of uric acid.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: Expression is very low in excess nitrogen (glutamate
    plus ammonia) and is induced during limiting-nitrogen conditions
    (glutamate). Expression is further induced when allantoin or uric
    acid are added during limiting-nitrogen conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the xanthine/uracil permease family.
