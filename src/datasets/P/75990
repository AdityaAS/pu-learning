new class of enzymes and evidence for conserved holin genes within the
siphoviral lysis cassettes.";

-!- FUNCTION: Induces host cell lysis by causing formation of pores in
    the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: There are 2 possible initiation sites, Met-1 and
    Met-4, which could result in 2 different length proteins. The
    longer form might inhibit the expression of the shorter.
Membrane; Phage lysis protein; Transmembrane.
