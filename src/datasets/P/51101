-!- FUNCTION: Possibly involved in the transport of ethanolamine from
    the periplasm to the cytoplasm.
-!- PATHWAY: Ethanolamine utilization.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (AAA80212) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 363.
