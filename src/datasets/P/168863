Solute carrier family 40 member 1 (Ferroportin-1) (Iron-regulated
transporter 1) (Metal transporter protein 1) (MTP1).
"A novel mammalian iron-regulated protein involved in intracellular
iron metabolism.";
"Positional cloning of zebrafish ferroportin1 identifies a conserved
vertebrate iron exporter.";
"A novel duodenal iron-regulated transporter, IREG1, implicated in the
basolateral transfer of iron to the circulation.";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in iron export from duodenal epithelial
    cell and also in transfer of iron between maternal and fetal
    circulation. Mediates iron efflux in the presence of a ferroxidase
    (hephaestin and/or ceruloplasmin).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Note=Localized to the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial
    cells.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: High expression in spleen, liver, kidney,
    heart and duodenum.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC40A transporter family.
