AC   Q60184;
V-type ATP synthase subunit C (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-type ATPase subunit C).
"Subunit structure and organization of the genes of the A1A0 ATPase
from the Archaeon Methanosarcina mazei Go1.";
"The genome of Methanosarcina mazei: evidence for lateral gene
transfer between Bacteria and Archaea.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton
    gradient across the membrane.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of seven subunits; A, B, C, D, E, F and G.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase V0D/AC39 subunit family.
