-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity uptake of alpha-glucosides such as
    maltose, turanose, isomaltose, alpha-methylglucoside, maltotriose,
    palatinose, trehalose, melezitose and glucose. Acts with the
    concomitant transport of protons into the cell (symport system).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By maltose and maltotriose. Repressed by glucose.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
