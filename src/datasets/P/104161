-!- FUNCTION: Probably act as a zinc ion transporter moving zinc from
    the nucleus/endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm. Involved in
    zinc ion homeostasis and cellular distribution.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P53735:YNR039C; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-34990, EBI-28507;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Nucleus; nuclear envelope;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Originally MSC2 was identified in a screen for
    mutants that show an increase in meiotic unequal sister-chromatid
    recombination (SCR). MSC2 may also be involved in chromosome
    instability, rather than SRC.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1070 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)
    transporter (TC 2.A.4) family. SLC30A subfamily.
