AC   Q06432;
Voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma-1 subunit (Dihydropyridine-
sensitive L-type, skeletal muscle calcium channel subunit gamma).
"Molecular characterization of the gene encoding the gamma subunit of
the human skeletal muscle 1,4-dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channel
(CACNLG), cDNA sequence, gene structure, and chromosomal location.";

"Localization of the gamma-subunit of the skeletal muscle L-type
voltage-dependent calcium channel gene (CACNLG) to human chromosome
band 17q24 by in situ hybridization and identification of a
polymorphic repetitive DNA sequence at the gene locus.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is a subunit of the dihydropyridine (DHP)
    sensitive calcium channel. Plays a role in excitation-contraction
    coupling. The skeletal muscle DHP-sensitive Ca(2+) channel may
    function only as a multiple subunit complex.
-!- SUBUNIT: The L-type calcium channel is composed of five subunits:
    alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta and gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Skeletal muscle.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family. CACNG
    subfamily.
