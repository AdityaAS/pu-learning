-!- FUNCTION: Exchange of extracellular arginine for intracellular
    agmatine. Required for arginine-dependent acid resistance.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By acidic conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily.
