AC   P08083;
Colicin-N.
"Nucleotide sequencing of the structural gene for colicin N reveals
homology between the catalytic, C-terminal domains of colicins A and
N.";
"The immunity and lysis genes of ColN plasmid pCHAP4.";
"Crystal structure of a colicin N fragment suggests a model for
toxicity.";
-!- FUNCTION: This colicin is a channel-forming colicin. This class of
    transmembrane toxins depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane, leading
    to dissipation of cellular energy.
-!- FUNCTION: Colicins are polypeptide toxins produced by and active
    against, Escherichia coli and closely related bacteria.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the channel forming colicin family.
