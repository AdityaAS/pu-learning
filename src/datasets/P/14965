-!- FUNCTION: Putative component of the machinery responsible for
    pumping aminotriazole (and possibly other toxic compounds) out of
    the cell. Probable ATP-dependent export permease. Appears to
    confer resistance only to aminotriazole.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: Deletion of the C-terminal 34 residues abolishes ATR1
    activity, while deletion of the C-terminal 23 residues have a
    minor effect.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1720 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.
