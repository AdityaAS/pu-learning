Menaquinol-cytochrome c reductase cytochrome b subunit.
"The cytochrome bc complex (menaquinone:cytochrome c reductase) in
Bacillus subtilis has a nontraditional subunit organization.";
"Sequence analysis of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome region between
the serA and kdg loci cloned in a yeast artificial chromosome.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Studies of the cytochrome subunits of menaquinone:cytochrome c
reductase (bc complex) of Bacillus subtilis. Evidence for the covalent
attachment of heme to the cytochrome b subunit.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the menaquinol-cytochrome c reductase
    complex.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 heme groups per subunit. One heme group is bound
    covalently by a single cysteine link, the other one non-
    covalently.
-!- SUBUNIT: The main subunits of the menaquinone:cytochrome c complex
    are: cytochrome b, the Rieske protein and a cytochrome b/c
    subunit.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This cytochrome b is similar to other bacterial and
    plant chloroplast cytochrome b6 proteins in binding one of two
    hemes with a single thioether bond.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome b family.
