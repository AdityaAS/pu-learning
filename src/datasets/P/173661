AC   Q9EP96;
Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1A4 (Solute
carrier family 21 member 5) (Sodium-independent organic anion-
transporting polypeptide 2).
"Genomic organization and tissue-specific expression of splice
variants of mouse organic anion transporting polypeptide 2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the Na(+)-independent transport of organic
    anions such as taurocholate, cholate, 17-beta-glucuronosyl
    estradiol, estrone-3-sulfate, the cardiac glycosides ouabain and
    digoxin and thyroid hormones (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=1;
      Comment=3 isoforms are produced;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q9EP96-1; Sequence=Displayed;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in brain and liver. Detected
    at very low levels in heart and lung.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the organo anion transporter (TC 2.A.60)
    family.
