AC   Q9BXT2;
Voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma-6 subunit (Neuronal voltage-
gated calcium channel gamma-6 subunit).
"A cluster of three novel Ca(2+) channel gamma subunit genes on
chromosome 19q13.4: evolution and expression profile of the gamma
subunit gene family.";
"Calcium channel gamma subunits provide insights into the evolution of
this gene family.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Thought to stabilize the calcium channel in an
    inactivated (closed) state (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The L-type calcium channel is composed of five subunits:
    alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta and gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family. CACNG
    subfamily.
