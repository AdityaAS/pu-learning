AC   P83248;
Oxyopinin-2a (Oxki2a).
"Oxyopinins, large amphipathic peptides isolated from the venom of the
wolf spider Oxyopes kitabensis with cytolytic properties and positive
insecticidal cooperativity with spider neurotoxins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Disrupts biological membranes, particularly those rich
    in phosphocholine. Has antimicrobial activity against Gram-
    negative bacterium E.coli, Gram-positive bacteria B.subtilis and
    S.aureus, and hemolytic activity against sheep, pig and guinea pig
    red blood cells. Has insecticidal activity against S.frugiperda
    ovarian cells by opening non-selective ion channels. Enhances the
    insecticidal activity of spider venom neurotoxic peptides.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=4127.1; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=1-37;
    NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the oxyopinin-2 family.
