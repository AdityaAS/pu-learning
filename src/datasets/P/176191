AC   O31100;
Solvent-resistant pump membrane transporter srpB.
"Identification and molecular characterization of an efflux pump
involved in Pseudomonas putida S12 solvent tolerance.";
"Active efflux of organic solvents by Pseudomonas putida S12 is
induced by solvents.";
-!- FUNCTION: The inner membrane transporter component of an organic
    solvent efflux pump. Involved in export of a number of low log POW
    compounds including hexane (log POW 3.5), toluene (log POW 2.5)
    and dimethylphthalate (log POW 2.3). The solvent resistance
    phenotype has been postulated to depend on the operon expression
    level.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Low constitutive expression; the srpABC operon is
    further induced up to 17-fold by organic solvents (e.g. toluene
    and aliphatic solvents and alcohols) but not by antibiotics, heavy
    metals, pH, temperature, high NaCl or 60 mM acetic acid.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acrB/acrD/acrF (TC 2.A.6) family.
