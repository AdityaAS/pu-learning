Protein ampG.
"AmpG, a signal transducer in chromosomal beta-lactamase induction.";
"The signal transducer encoded by ampG is essential for induction of
chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase in Escherichia coli by beta-lactam
antibiotics and 'unspecific' inducers.";
"Sequence of minutes 4-25 of Escherichia coli.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably acts as a permease in the beta-lactamase
    induction system and in peptidoglycan recycling.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.
