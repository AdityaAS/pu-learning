AC   P0A856; P19935;
Protein tolB precursor.
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the tonB-independent uptake of group A
    colicins (colicins A, E1, E2, E3 and K). Necessary for the
    colicins to reach their respective targets after initial binding
    to the bacteria (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tolB family.
