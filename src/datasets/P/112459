-!- FUNCTION: The transhydrogenation between NADH and NADP is coupled
    to respiration and ATP hydrolysis and functions as a proton pump
    across the membrane.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADPH + NAD(+) = NADP(+) + NADH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein; matrix side (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the AlaDH/PNT
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the PNT beta
    subunit family.
