AC   P15754;
Type 4 prepilin-like proteins leader peptide-processing enzyme
(Pullulanase secretion protein pulO) [Includes: Leader peptidase
(EC 3.4.23.43) (Prepilin peptidase); N-methyltransferase
(EC 2.1.1.-)].
"Five genes at the 3' end of the Klebsiella pneumoniae pulC operon are
required for pullulanase secretion.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cleaves type-4 fimbrial leader sequence and methylates
    the N-terminal (generally Phe) residue. Required for the
    translocation of pullulanase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Typically cleaves a -Gly-|-Phe- bond to
    release an N-terminal, basic peptide of 5-8 residues from type IV
    prepilin, and then N-methylates the new N-terminal amino group,
    the methyl donor being S-adenosyl-L-methionine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase A24 family.
