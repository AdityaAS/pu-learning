-!- FUNCTION: Actively transports glucose into cells by Na(+)
    cotransport with a Na(+) to glucose coupling ratio of 2:1.
    Efficient substrate transport in mammalian kidney is provided by
    the concerted action of a low affinity high capacity and a high
    affinity low capacity Na(+)/glucose cotransporter arranged in
    series along kidney proximal tubules.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed mainly in intestine and kidney.
-!- PTM: N-glycosylation is not necessary for the cotransporter
    function.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC5A1 are the cause of congenital
    glucose/galactose malabsorption (GGM) [MIM:606824]. GGM is an
    intestinal monosaccharide transporter deficiency. It is an
    autosomal recessive disorder manifesting itself within the first
    weeks of life. It is characterized by severe diarrhea and
    dehydration which are usually fatal unless glucose and galactose
    are eliminated from the diet.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:solute symporter (SSF)
    (TC 2.A.21) family.
