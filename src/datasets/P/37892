-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex cysAWTP
    (TC 3.A.1.6.1) involved in sulfate/thiosulfate import. This
    protein specifically binds thiosulfate and is involved in its
    transmembrane transport.
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (cysA), two transmembrane proteins (cysT and cysW) and a solute-
    binding protein (cysP) (Probable).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0A6Y8:dnaK; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-560567, EBI-542092;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic sulfate binding protein
    family.
