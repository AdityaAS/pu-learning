Voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 3 (VDAC-3) (mVDAC3)
(Outer mitochondrial membrane protein porin 3).
"A novel mouse mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel gene
localizes to chromosome 8.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Substrate and functional diversity of lysine acetylation revealed by
a proteomics survey.";
-!- FUNCTION: Forms a channel through the mitochondrial outer membrane
    that allows diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highest levels of expression detected in
    testis, less but still abundant expression in heart, kidney,
    brain, and skeletal muscle.
-!- DOMAIN: Consists mainly of membrane-spanning sided beta-sheets.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eukaryotic mitochondrial porin family.
