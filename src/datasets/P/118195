protein opnP).
"Functional and regulatory analysis of the OmpF-like porin, OpnP, of
the symbiotic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophilus.";
-!- FUNCTION: OmpF is a porin that forms passive diffusion pores which
    allow small molecular weight hydrophilic materials across the
    outer membrane. It is also a receptor for the bacteriophage T2 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
