Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT 1) (Solute carrier family 16 member
1).
"cDNA cloning of the human monocarboxylate transporter 1 and
chromosomal localization of the SLC16A1 locus to 1p13.2-p12.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Mutations in MCT1 cDNA in patients with symptomatic deficiency in
lactate transport.";
-!- FUNCTION: Proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter. Catalyzes the
    rapid transport across the plasma membrane of many
    monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate, branched-chain oxo
    acids derived from leucine, valine and isoleucine, and the ketone
    bodies acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed in normal and in cancer
    cells.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC16A1 are the cause of symptomatic
    deficiency in lactate transport (SDLT). SDLT is characterized by a
    subnormal erythrocyte lactate transport and signs of muscle injury
    on exercice and heat exposure.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.
    Monocarboxylate porter (TC 2.A.1.13) family.
