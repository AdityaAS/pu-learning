AC   P60698; Q9ZNG0;
Na(+)/H(+) antiporter subunit G (Mnh complex subunit G).
"A putative multisubunit Na+/H+ antiporter from Staphylococcus
aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mnh complex is a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter involved in Na(+)
    excretion.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Na(+) extrusion is completely inhibited by the
    H(+) conductor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP).
-!- SUBUNIT: May form a hetero-oligomeric complex that consists of
    seven subunits: mnhA, mnhB, mnhC, mnhD, mnhE, mnhF and mnhG.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CPA3 antiporters (TC 2.A.63) subunit G
    family.
