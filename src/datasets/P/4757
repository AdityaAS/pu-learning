AC   Q9X4Y1;
Periplasmic alpha-galactoside-binding protein precursor.
"Alpha-galactoside uptake in Rhizobium meliloti: isolation and
characterization of agpA, a gene encoding a periplasmic binding
protein required for melibiose and raffinose utilization.";
"The complete sequence of the 1,683-kb pSymB megaplasmid from the N2-
fixing endosymbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably involved in an alpha-galactosides intake
    transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 5
    family.
