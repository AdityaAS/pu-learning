Chaperone protein torD.
"TMAO anaerobic respiration in Escherichia coli: involvement of the
tor operon.";
"An analogue of the DnaJ molecular chaperone in Escherichia coli.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"TorD, a cytoplasmic chaperone that interacts with the unfolded
trimethylamine N-oxide reductase enzyme (TorA) in Escherichia coli.";
"Involvement of a mate chaperone (TorD) in the maturation pathway of
molybdoenzyme TorA.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the biogenesis of torA. Acts on torA before
    the insertion of the molybdenum cofactor and, as a result,
    probably favors a conformation of the apoenzyme that is competent
    for acquiring the cofactor.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the torD/dmsD family. TorD subfamily.
