Serine protease espC precursor (EC 3.4.21.-) (EPEC-secreted protein
C).
"Characterization of EspC, a 110-kilodalton protein secreted by
enteropathogenic Escherichia coli which is homologous to members of
the immunoglobulin A protease-like family of secreted proteins.";
"EspC pathogenicity island of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli
encodes an enterotoxin.";
"Protein secretion by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli is essential
for transducing signals to epithelial cells.";
"The serine protease motif of EspC from enteropathogenic Escherichia
coli produces epithelial damage by a mechanism different from that of
Pet toxin from enteroaggregative E. coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Serine protease with enterotoxic and cytotoxic
    activities. Cleaves fodrin, but does not cause its redistribution
    within epithelial cells. The exact role of espC in EPEC
    pathogenesis is still unknown.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibition of cytotoxic activity by
    phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Expression is repressed by glucose.
-!- DOMAIN: The signal peptide guides the precursor to the periplasmic
    space, and the C-terminal helper domain associates with the outer
    membrane to form a pore for excretion of the protease domain. The
    helper domain is then released (Probable).
-!- PTM: Cleaved to release the mature protein from the outer
    membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 autotransporter (TC 1.B.12) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase S6 domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to frameshifts
    in positions 560, 566 and 574.
