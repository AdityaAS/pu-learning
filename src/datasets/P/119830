Membrane protein oxaA 1 precursor.

"Expression of spoIIIJ in the prespore is sufficient for activation of
sigma G and for sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Membrane protein required for the insertion of membrane
    proteins into the membrane. Also involved in protein secretion
    processes. Essential for sporulation by activating spoIIIG/sigG in
    the prespore. It has an overlapping, through partly distinct,
    function compared to oxaA2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: SpoIIIJ is required only after engulfment and
    turned off at the onset of sporulation. Predominantly expressed in
    vegetative cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the OXA1/oxaA family. Type 2 subfamily.
