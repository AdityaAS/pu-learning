-!- FUNCTION: This protein is one of the chains of the nonenzymatic
    membrane component (F0) of ATPase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O = ADP + phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The ATPase of P.modestum is of special interest
    because it uses sodium ions instead of protons as the
    physiological coupling ion.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase C chain family.
