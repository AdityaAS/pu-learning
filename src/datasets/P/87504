Glutathione-regulated potassium-efflux system ancillary protein kefG.
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for full activity of kefB (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: It is unlikely that kefG has oxidoreductase
    activity, it has probably evolved from its function as
    oxidoreductase to be regulator of kefB.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) family.
    KefG subfamily.
 GO:0006813; P:potassium ion transport; IEA:HAMAP.
