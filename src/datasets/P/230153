Yop proteins translocation protein R.
"The lcrB (yscN/U) gene cluster of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is
involved in Yop secretion and shows high homology to the spa gene
clusters of Shigella flexneri and Salmonella typhimurium.";
"Insights into the evolution of Yersinia pestis through whole-genome
comparison with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the yop secretion machinery. May have a
    role in the negative pathway regulation of yop expression
    controlled by calcium.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fliP/mopC/spaP family.
