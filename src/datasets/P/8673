flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for L-arabinose. Probably responsible for the translocation of the
    substrate across the membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. AraH/rbsC subfamily.
