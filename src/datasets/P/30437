Cobalt uptake protein COT1.
"COT1, a gene involved in cobalt accumulation in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae.";
"Sequencing of a 35.71 kb DNA segment on the right arm of yeast
chromosome XV reveals regions of similarity to chromosomes I and
XIII.";

"A subset of membrane-associated proteins is ubiquitinated in response
to mutations in the endoplasmic reticulum degradation machinery.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably responsible for the uptake of cobalt ions. It
    appears to act in a dosage-dependent manner to counteract the
    adverse effects of cobalt ions on cells. It may participate in the
    regulation of cobalt levels under normal physiological conditions
    and may be important in the supply of metal that is required for
    metalloenzyme or cofactor synthesis. It reduces the toxicity of
    cobalt and rhodium ions. Other components responsible for cobalt
    transport exist.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein. Note=Another possibility exists that
    it is associated with another unidentified membrane that has been
    enriched in the mitochondrial membrane fractions.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 2070 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)
    transporter (TC 2.A.4) family. SLC30A subfamily.
