Dermonecrotic toxin (DNT) (PMT) (Mitogenic toxin).
"The complete nucleotide sequence of the Pasteurella multocida toxin
gene and evidence for a transcriptional repressor, TxaR.";
"Sequence of the dermonecrotic toxin of Pasteurella multocida ssp.
multocida.";
"Sequence analysis of the potent mitogenic toxin of Pasteurella
multocida.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a dermonecrotic toxin. This osteolytic toxin,
    induces bone resorption. Potent mitogen. This toxin is associated
    with the severe progressive form of the atrophic rhinitis, a major
    respiratory disease in pigs.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Closely spaced cysteine and histidine residues may
    provide the toxin with an affinity for metal.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The sequence shown is that of strain NCTC 12178.
