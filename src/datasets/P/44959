-!- FUNCTION: Required for disulfide bond formation in some
    periplasmic proteins such as phoA or ompA. Acts by oxidizing the
    dsbA protein.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0AEG4:dsbA; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1170740, EBI-549711;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dsbB family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.6 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 130.
