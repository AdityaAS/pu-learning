-!- FUNCTION: Plays a critical role in the incorporation of
    lipoproteins in the outer membrane after they are released by the
    lolA protein. Essential for E.coli viability.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; lipid-anchor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lolB family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) thought to be involved in delta-
    aminolevulinic acid biosynthesis.
