-!- FUNCTION: Necessary for efficient export of extracytoplasmic
    proteins. Binds to the signal sequence when it emerges from the
    ribosomes.
-!- SUBUNIT: Signal recognition particle consists of a 4.5 RNA
    molecule and protein ffh.
-!- DOMAIN: The protein has a two domain structure: the G-domain binds
    GTP; the M-domain binds the RNA and also binds the signal
    sequence.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GTP-binding SRP family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 100.
