AC   P80282;
Dermaseptin BI precursor (Dermaseptin B1).
"Precursors of vertebrate peptide antibiotics dermaseptin b and
adenoregulin have extensive sequence identities with precursors of
opioid peptides dermorphin, dermenkephalin, and deltorphins.";
"Isolation and structure of novel defensive peptides from frog skin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Possesses a potent antimicrobial activity against
    bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Probably acts by disturbing membrane
    functions with its amphipathic structure.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the skin glands.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the frog skin active peptide (FSAP) family.
    Dermaseptin subfamily.
Amidation; Amphibian defense peptide; Antibiotic; Antimicrobial;
