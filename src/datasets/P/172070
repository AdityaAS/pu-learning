-!- FUNCTION: Structural component of the gap junctions at electrical
    synapses in distal and mid-depth levels in the lamina. Isoform
    lethal forms voltage sensitive intercellular channels through
    homotypic interactions.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (isoform lethal).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
      Comment=Additional isoforms seem to exist;
    Name=Lethal; Synonyms=A;
      IsoId=P33085-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Neural; Synonyms=C;
      IsoId=P33085-2; Sequence=VSP_002678, VSP_002679;
    Name=B;
      IsoId=P33085-3; Sequence=VSP_012897, VSP_012898;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Isoform neural is expressed in synapses of
    giant fibers (GF), in a large thoracic cell in location of
    postsynaptic target and optic lobe lamina and medulla. Isoform
    lethal is expressed in embryonic mesodermal derivatives. During
    metamorphosis, both isoforms are dynamically expressed in pupal
    nervous system.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Passover flies mutant for the common C-terminus
    fail to jump in response to a light-off stimulus. Neural-specific
    mutants exhibit modified giant fiber system and gustatory
    response.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pannexin family.
