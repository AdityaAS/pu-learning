AC   Q52715; Q52713;
Electron transport complex protein rnfD (Nitrogen fixation protein
rnfD).
"Identification of a new class of nitrogen fixation genes in
Rhodobacter capsulatus: a putative membrane complex involved in
electron transport to nitrogenase.";
"Overexpression in Escherichia coli of the rnf genes from Rhodobacter
capsulatus -- characterization of two membrane-bound iron-sulfur
proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for nitrogen fixation. May be part of a
    membrane complex functioning as an intermediate in the electron
    transport to nitrogenase.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of at least six subunits; rnfA, rnfB, rnfC,
    rnfD, rnfE and rnfG.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Expression is reduced under iron-limiting conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nqrB/rnfD family.
