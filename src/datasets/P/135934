-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in mannitol transport (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIA N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine +
    protein EIIB = protein EIIA + protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine + sugar = protein EIIB + sugar phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIC domain forms the PTS system translocation channel
    and contains the specific substrate-binding site.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIB domain is phosphorylated by phospho-EIIA on a
    cysteinyl or histidyl residue, depending on the transported sugar.
    Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the sugar substrate
    concomitantly with the sugar uptake processed by the EIIC domain.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIA domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr on a
    histidyl residue. Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the
    EIIB domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIA type-2 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIB type-2 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIC type-2 domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (BAA07350) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 375, 398 and 421.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (BAA09029) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 375, 398 and 421.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (CAB12206) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 375, 398 and 421.
