AC   P32799;
Cytochrome c oxidase polypeptide VIa, mitochondrial precursor
(EC 1.9.3.1).
"Subunit VIa of yeast cytochrome c oxidase is not necessary for
assembly of the enzyme complex but modulates the enzyme activity.
Isolation and characterization of the nuclear-coded gene.";
"Sequencing of a 40.5 kb fragment located on the left arm of
chromosome VII from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII.";
"Creation of the YFLEX clone resource: cloning of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae ORFs in the Gateway recombinational cloning system.";
"Purification of yeast cytochrome c oxidase with a subunit composition
resembling the mammalian enzyme.";
"Kinetic properties and ligand binding of the eleven-subunit
cytochrome-c oxidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated with a
novel large-scale purification method.";
-!- FUNCTION: Not necessary for assembly of the enzyme complex but
    interacts with ATP and thereby modulates the enzyme activity.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Cytochrome c oxidase is composed of 11 subunits: one copy
    each of COX1, COX2, COX3, COX4, COX5A or COX5B, COX6, COX7, COX9,
    COX12, COX13 and two copies of COX8.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase VIa family.
