AC   P55017;
Solute carrier family 12 member 3 (Thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride
cotransporter) (Na-Cl symporter).
"Gitelman's variant of Bartter's syndrome, inherited hypokalaemic
alkalosis, is caused by mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl
cotransporter.";
"Molecular cloning, expression pattern, and chromosomal localization
of the human Na-Cl thiazide-sensitive cotransporter (SLC12A3).";
-!- FUNCTION: Electrically silent transporter system. Mediates sodium
    and chloride reabsorption.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominant in kidney.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC12A3 are the cause of Gitelman syndrome
    (GS) [MIM:263800]. GS is an autosomal recessive disease
    characterized by diverse abnormalities in electrolyte homeostasis
    including hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. GS is a subset of
    Bartter syndrome.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC12A transporter family.
