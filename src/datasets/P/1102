Neutral amino acid transporter B(0) (ATB(0)) (Sodium-dependent neutral
amino acid transporter type 2) (RD114/simian type D retrovirus
receptor) (Baboon M7 virus receptor).
"Cloning of the sodium-dependent, broad-scope, neutral amino acid
transporter Bo from a human placental choriocarcinoma cell line.";
"The RD114/simian type D retrovirus receptor is a neutral amino acid
transporter.";
"A sodium-dependent neutral-amino-acid transporter mediates infections
of feline and baboon endogenous retroviruses and simian type D
retroviruses.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Truncated forms of the dual function human ASCT2 neutral amino acid
transporter/retroviral receptor are translationally initiated at
multiple alternative CUG and GUG codons.";
-!- FUNCTION: Has a broad substrate specificity, a preference for
    zwitterionic amino acids, and a sodium-dependence. It accepts as
    substrates all neutral amino acids, including glutamine,
    asparagine, and branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, and
    excludes methylated amino acids, anionic amino acids, and cationic
    amino acids. Act as a cell surface receptor for feline endogenous
    virus RD114, baboon M7 endogenous virus and type D simian
    retroviruses.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative initiation; Named isoforms=1;
      Comment=A number of isoforms are produced by alternative
      initiation. Isoforms start at multiple alternative CUG and GUG
      codons;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q15758-1; Sequence=Displayed;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney,
    pancreas, and intestine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:dicarboxylate (SDF) symporter
    (TC 2.A.23) family.
