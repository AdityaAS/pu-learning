AC   P29708;
ATP synthase delta chain, sodium ion specific (EC 3.6.3.15).
"Cloning, sequencing and in vivo expression of genes encoding the F0
part of the sodium-ion-dependent ATP synthase of Propionigenium
modestum in Escherichia coli.";
"N-terminal amino acid sequences of the subunits of the Na(+)-
translocating F1F0 ATPase from Propionigenium modestum.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein seems to be part of the stalk that links
    CF(0) to CF(1). It either transmits conformational changes from
    CF(0) into CF(1) or is implicated in proton conduction.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O = ADP + phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The ATPase of P.modestum is of special interest
    because it uses sodium ions instead of protons as the
    physiological coupling ion.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase delta chain family.
