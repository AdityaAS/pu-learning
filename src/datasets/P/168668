AC   P51574;
Oligopeptide transporter, small intestine isoform (Peptide transporter
1) (Intestinal H(+)/peptide cotransporter) (Solute carrier family 15
member 1) (Proton-coupled dipeptide cotransporter).
"Sequence, tissue distribution and developmental changes in rat
intestinal oligopeptide transporter.";
"Cloning and characterization of a rat H+/peptide cotransporter
mediating absorption of beta-lactam antibiotics in the intestine and
kidney.";
-!- FUNCTION: Proton-coupled intake of oligopeptides of 2 to 4 amino
    acids with a preference for dipeptides. May constitute a major
    route for the absorption of protein digestion end-products.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PTR2/POT transporter (TC 2.A.17)
    family.
