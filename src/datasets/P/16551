Benzoate membrane transport protein.
"Nucleotide sequences of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus benABC genes
for benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase reveal evolutionary relationships among
multicomponent oxygenases.";
"Unique features revealed by the genome sequence of Acinetobacter sp.
ADP1, a versatile and naturally transformation competent bacterium.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably involved in the transport of benzoate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The ben operon encode the proteins responsible for
    the degradation of benzoate to catechol.
