Macrolide export ATP-binding/permease protein macB (EC 3.6.3.-).
"Novel macrolide-specific ABC-type efflux transporter in Escherichia
coli.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Membrane topology of ABC-type macrolide antibiotic exporter MacB in
Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex macAB involved in
    macrolide export. Transmembrane domains (TMD) form a pore in the
    inner membrane and the ATP-binding domain (NBD) is responsible for
    energy generation. Seems to confer resistance against macrolides
    composed of 14- and 15-membered lactones but no or weak resistance
    against 16-membered ones (Probable).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- DOMAIN: In macB the ATP-binding domain (NBD) and the transmembrane
    domain (TMD) are fused.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The complex macAB-tolC (OMF) forms a single
    transport channel across the two membranes, allowing direct export
    of macrolide. This channel is involved in type 1 secretion system.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Macrolide
    exporter (TC 3.A.1.122) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
