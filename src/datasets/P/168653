AC   Q9Z0Z5;
Solute carrier family 13 member 3 (Sodium-dependent high-affinity
dicarboxylate transporter 2) (Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter 3)
(NaDC-3) (rNaDC3).
"Primary structure and functional characteristics of a mammalian
sodium-coupled high affinity dicarboxylate transporter.";
"Molecular and functional analysis of SDCT2, a novel rat sodium-
dependent dicarboxylate transporter.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter that
    accepts a range of substrates with 4-5 carbon atoms. The
    stoichiometry is probably 3 Na(+) for 1 divalent succinate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in proximal parts of straight
    tubules in the kidney. Detected in placenta, in meningeal layers
    in the brain, and in hepatocytes surrounding the central vein in
    liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC13A transporter (TC 2.A.47) family.
    NADC subfamily.
