-!- FUNCTION: Nonselective, voltage-independent cation channel
    mediating sodium and calcium ion influx in response to oxidative
    stress. Extracellular calcium passes through the channel and acts
    from the intracellular side as a positive regulator in channel
    activation. Activated by ADP-ribose, nicotinamide adenine
    dinucleotide (NAD(+)), reactive nitrogen species and arachidonic
    acid. Inactivated by intracellular ATP. Confers susceptibility to
    cell death following oxidative stress. Isoform 2 does not seem to
    be regulated by ADPR. Has ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase activity.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ADP-ribose + H(2)O = AMP + D-ribose 5-
    phosphate.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=100 uM for ADP-ribose;
      Vmax=0.1 umol/min/mg enzyme;
-!- SUBUNIT: Isoform 1 can interact with isoform 3. This interaction
    decreases calcium influx through isoform 1 and suppresses
    susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced cell death.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.

    cells, such as neutrophils. Also detected in bone marrow, spleen,
    heart, liver and lung. Isoform 2 is found in neutrophil
    granulocytes.
