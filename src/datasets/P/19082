-!- FUNCTION: Probable cadaverine/lysine antiporter or part of it.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: At low pH in the presence of lysine and achieves
    maximal level under anaerobic conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily.
