High-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport system permease
protein livM (LIV-I protein M).
"Nucleotide sequence and genetic characterization reveal six essential
genes for the LIV-I and LS transport systems of Escherichia coli.";
"Analysis of the Escherichia coli genome. V. DNA sequence of the
region from 76.0 to 81.5 minutes.";

-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for branched-chain amino acids. Probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrates across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. LivHM subfamily.
