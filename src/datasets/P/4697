AC   Q9Z3R9;
Alpha-glucoside transport ATP-binding protein aglK.
"A novel Sinorhizobium meliloti operon encodes an alpha-glucosidase
and a periplasmic-binding-protein-dependent transport system for
alpha-glucosides.";
"Analysis of the chromosome sequence of the legume symbiont
Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for alpha-glucosides such as sucrose, maltose and trehalose.
    Probably responsible for energy coupling to the transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
