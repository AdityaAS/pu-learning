AC   P52178;
Triose phosphate/phosphate translocator, non-green plastid,
chloroplast precursor (CTPT).
"A new class of plastidic phosphate translocators: a putative link
between primary and secondary metabolism by the
phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate antiporter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the export of fixed carbons from the
    chloroplasts into the cytosol in the form of triose phosphates.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity). Note=Located in zones
    of contact between the inner and outer membrane of the chloroplast
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TPT transporter family. TPT
    (TC 2.A.7.9.1) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DUF6 domain.
