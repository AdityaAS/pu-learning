-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the high-affinity maltose membrane transport
    system malEFGK. Initial receptor for the active transport of and
    chemotaxis toward maltooligosaccharides.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 1
    family.
