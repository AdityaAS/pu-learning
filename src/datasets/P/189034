AC   Q01852;
Import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM44, mitochondrial
precursor (Mitochondrial protein import protein 1) (Inner membrane
import site protein 45) (ISP45) (Membrane import machinery protein
MIM44).
"MPI1, an essential gene encoding a mitochondrial membrane protein, is
possibly involved in protein import into yeast mitochondria.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IX.";
"Protein import into yeast mitochondria: the inner membrane import
site protein ISP45 is the MPI1 gene product.";
"Pam17 is required for architecture and translocation activity of the
mitochondrial protein import motor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential component of the PAM complex, a complex
    required for the translocation of transit peptide-containing
    proteins from the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix in
    an ATP-dependent manner. Recruits mitochondrial HSP70 and its co-
    chaperone (MGE1) to drive protein translocation into the matrix
    using ATP as an energy source.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the PAM complex, at least composed of SSC1
    (mtHsp70), MGE1, TIM44, PAM16/TIM16, PAM17 and PAM18/TIM14. Forms
    part of the receptor complex that consists of at least 3 different
    proteins (TIM17, TIM23, TIM44).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tim44 family.
