AC   Q9WTW7;
Solute carrier family 23 member 1 (Sodium-dependent vitamin C
transporter 1) (Na(+)/L-ascorbic acid transporter 1).
"A family of mammalian Na+-dependent L-ascorbic acid transporters.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium/ascorbate cotransporter. Mediates electrogenic
    uptake of vitamin C, with a stoichiometry of 2 Na(+) for each
    ascorbate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in the straight segment of
    proximal tubules in the kidney, in intestine and liver. Detected
    in epithelial cells of the bronchiole and epididymis.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the xanthine/uracil permease family. SLC23A
    subfamily.
