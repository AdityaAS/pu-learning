-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in the regulation of the lipid
    composition of sperm membranes during the maturation in the
    epididymis (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Epididymis.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in NPC2 are the cause of Niemann-Pick disease
    type C2 (NPC2) [MIM:607625]. NPC2 is a fatal autosomal recessive
    hereditary disease characterized by the accumulation of low-
    density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol in lysosomes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NPC2 family.
