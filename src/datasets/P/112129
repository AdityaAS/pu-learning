"Helicobacter pylori nickel-transport gene nixA: synthesis of
catalytically active urease in Escherichia coli independent of growth
conditions.";
"The complete genome sequence of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter
pylori.";
"Membrane topology of the NixA nickel transporter of Helicobacter
pylori: two nickel transport-specific motifs within transmembrane
helices II and III.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity nickel intake protein. Imports nickel ions
    in an energy-dependent fashion. Necessary for the expression of
    catalytically active urease.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NiCoT transporter (TC 2.A.52) family.
