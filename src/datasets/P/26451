AC   P42308;
Citrate transporter.
"Sequencing of a 65 kb region of the Bacillus subtilis genome
containing the lic and cel loci, and creation of a 177 kb contig
covering the gnt-sacXY region.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Genes encoding xylan and beta-glucan hydrolysing enzymes in Bacillus
subtilis: characterization, mapping and construction of strains
deficient in lichenase, cellulase and xylanase.";
"Secondary transporters for citrate and the Mg(2+)-citrate complex in
Bacillus subtilis are homologous proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transports the free citrate anion. Probably cotransports
    citrate and at least three or four protons. The citrate uptake is
    inhibited by the presence of magnesium ions.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the citM transporter family.
