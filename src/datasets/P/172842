-!- FUNCTION: Able to suppress the functional loss of YPT1. May form a
    channel. Protein SLY41 is not essential for cell viability. The
    SLY41 gene is a multicopy suppressor.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 784 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TPT transporter family.
