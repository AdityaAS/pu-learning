-!- FUNCTION: Facilitative glucose transporter. This isoform may be
    responsible for constitutive or basal glucose uptake. Has a very
    broad substrate specificity; can transport a wide range of aldoses
    including both pentoses and hexoses.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity). Note=Localizes primarily at the cell surface (By
    similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed at variable levels in many human
    tissues.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC2A1 are the cause of autosomal dominant
    GLUT1 deficiency syndrome [MIM:606777]. This disease causes a
    defect in glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier. It is
    characterized by infantile seizures, delayed development, and
    acquired microcephaly.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family. Glucose transporter subfamily.
