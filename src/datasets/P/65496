AC   P0AC95; P39373;
High-affinity gluconate transporter (Gluconate permease 3) (Gnt-III
system).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity gluconate transporter with fairly broad
    specificity, including low affinity for glucuronate, several
    disaccharides, and some hexoses, but not glucose (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Gluconate utilization.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gntP permease family.
