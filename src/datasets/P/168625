AC   P55016;
Solute carrier family 12 member 1 (Bumetanide-sensitive sodium-
(potassium)-chloride cotransporter 2) (Kidney-specific Na-K-Cl
symporter).
"Molecular cloning, primary structure, and characterization of two
members of the mammalian electroneutral sodium-(potassium)-chloride
cotransporter family expressed in kidney.";
-!- FUNCTION: Electrically silent transporter system. Mediates sodium
    and chloride reabsorption. Plays a vital role in the regulation of
    ionic balance and cell volume.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominant in kidney.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC12A transporter family.
