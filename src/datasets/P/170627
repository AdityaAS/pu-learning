-!- FUNCTION: Acts as component of the Sec62/63 complex which is
    involved in SRP-independent posttranslational translocation across
    the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions together with the
    Sec61 complex and KAR2 in a channel-forming translocon complex. A
    cycle of assembly and disassembly of Sec62/63 complex from SEC61
    may govern the activity of the translocon. SEC66 is required to
    attach or retain SEC72 in the SEC63 complex. It is essential for
    growth at elevated temperatures.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the heterotetrameric Sec62/63complex
    composed of SEC62, SEC63, SEC66 and SEC72. The Sec62/63 complex
    associates with the Sec61 complex to form the Sec complex. Part of
    a complex consisting of KAR2, SEC63, SEC66 and SEC72.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; single-pass type II membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 7820 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: To S.pombe SpBC409.21.
