AC   Q9KWV4;
Toluene efflux pump membrane transporter ttgE.
"A set of genes encoding a second toluene efflux system in Pseudomonas
putida DOT-T1 is linked to the tod genes for toluene metabolism.";
"Global and cognate regulators control the expression of the organic
solvent efflux pumps TtgABC and TtgDEF of Pseudomonas putida.";
-!- FUNCTION: The inner membrane transporter component of an inducible
    organic solvent efflux pump. Involved in export of toluene and
    styrene but not of m-xylene, propylbenzene or ethylbenzene. Is not
    involved in antibiotic or AMP efflux.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: The ttgDEF operon is induced in the presence of toluene
    and styrene, but not m-xylene.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acrB/acrD/acrF (TC 2.A.6) family.
