AC   P19072;
Branched chain amino acid transport system II carrier protein (LIV-
II).
"Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene braB coding for the
sodium-coupled branched-chain amino acid carrier in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa PAO.";
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the LIV-II transport system for branched-
    chain amino acids. BraB is specific for isoleucine, leucine and
    valine. The LIV-II transport system is coupled to sodium and
    lithium ions.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the braC/braZ/brnQ transporter family.
