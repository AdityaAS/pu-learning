AC   P0AAD7; P36559;
Serine transporter.
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the import of serine into the cell. May be
    required for phage C1 adsorption by interacting with drcB. May
    also be involved in ampicillin sensitivity (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By leucine and by growth in rich medium (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid/polyamine transporter 2
    family. SdaC/tdcC subfamily.
