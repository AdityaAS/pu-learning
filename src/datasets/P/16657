"DNA sequence and analysis of the bet genes encoding the
osmoregulatory choline-glycine betaine pathway of Escherichia coli.";
"Sequence of minutes 4-25 of Escherichia coli.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";

-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity uptake of choline driven by a proton-
    motive force.
-!- PATHWAY: Amine and polyamine biosynthesis; betaine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By osmotic stress. Choline is required for full
    expression.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the BCCT transporter (TC 2.A.15) family.
