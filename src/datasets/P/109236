"Derived structure of the putative sialic acid transporter from
Escherichia coli predicts a novel sugar permease domain.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";

-!- FUNCTION: May be a sugar-cation symporter involved in sialic acid
    transport as it is required for sialic acid uptake.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By N-acetylneuraminate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family. Sialic acid transporter
    (TC 2.A.1.12.1) subfamily.
