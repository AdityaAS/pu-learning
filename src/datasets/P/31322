-!- FUNCTION: This small integral protein plays a role in holoenzyme
    assembly or stability.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Cytochrome c oxidase is composed of 11 subunits: one copy
    each of COX1, COX2, COX3, COX4, COX5A or COX5B, COX6, COX7, COX9,
    COX12, COX13 and two copies of COX8.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 35500 molecules/cell.
