-!- FUNCTION: Required for correct localization of precursor proteins
    bearing signal peptides with the twin arginine conserved motif
    S/T-R-R-X-F-L-K. This sec-independent pathway is termed TAT for
    twin-arginine translocation system. This system mainly transports
    proteins with bound cofactors that require folding prior to
    export.
-!- SUBUNIT: So far, according to different studies, three types of
    complexes have been observed. A tatABC complex, a spectrum of
    homooligomeric tatA complexes and a complex containing only tatA
    and tatB.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tatB family.
