-!- FUNCTION: Forms a water-specific channel that provides the plasma
    membranes of red cells and kidney proximal tubules with high
    permeability to water, thereby permitting water to move in the
    direction of an osmotic gradient.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in a number of tissues including
    erythrocytes, renal tubules, retinal pigment epithelium, heart,
    lung, skeletal muscle, kidney and pancreas. Weakly expressed in
    brain, placenta and liver.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- POLYMORPHISM: AQP1 is responsible for the Colton blood group
    system. Approximately 92% of Caucasians are Co(A+B-) (Ala-45),
    approximately 8% are Co(A+B+), and only 0.2% are Co(A-B+) (Val-
    45). Co(A-B-) which is very rare, is due to a complete absence of
    AQP1.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Pharmacologically inhibited by submillimolar
    concentrations of mercury.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
