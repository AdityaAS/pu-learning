Solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 5
(Glucose transporter type 5, small intestine) (Fructose transporter).
"Human facilitative glucose transporters. Isolation, functional
characterization, and gene localization of cDNAs encoding an isoform
(GLUT5) expressed in small intestine, kidney, muscle, and adipose
tissue and an unusual glucose transporter pseudogene-like sequence
(GLUT6).";

-!- FUNCTION: Cytochalasin B-sensitive carrier. Seems to function
    primarily as a fructose transporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in small intestine, and at much
    lower levels in kidney, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue.
-!- INDUCTION: By forskolin (in Caco-2 cells).
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=54973.98; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=1-501;
    NOTE=Ref.4.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family. Glucose transporter subfamily.
