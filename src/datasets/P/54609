-!- FUNCTION: Iron-efflux transporter responsible for iron
    detoxification. Also able to transport Zn(2+) in a proton-
    dependent manner.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)
    transporter (TC 2.A.4) family. FieF subfamily.
