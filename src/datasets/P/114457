AC   P43437;
V-type sodium ATP synthase subunit F (EC 3.6.3.14) (Na(+)-
translocating ATPase subunit F).
"Sequencing and characterization of the ntp gene cluster for vacuolar-
type Na(+)-translocating ATPase of Enterococcus hirae.";
"Operon of vacuolar-type Na(+)-ATPase of Enterococcus hirae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in ATP-driven sodium extrusion.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase G subunit family.
