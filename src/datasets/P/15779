and comparison with bacteriorhodopsin.";
"Genome sequence of Halobacterium species NRC-1.";
"Structure of the light-driven chloride pump halorhodopsin at 1.8-A
resolution.";
-!- FUNCTION: Halorhodopsin is a light-driven chloride pump.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Absorption:
      Abs(max)=~568 nm;
      Note=In the presence of anions, the maximum absorption shifts to
      about 578 nm;
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the archaeal/bacterial/fungal opsin family.
