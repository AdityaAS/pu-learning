-!- FUNCTION: Involved in tryptophan transport across the cytoplasmic
    membrane. Plays a role in transporting tryptophan which is to be
    used catabolically.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By tryptophan. Is subject to catabolic repression.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid/polyamine transporter 2
    family. Mtr/tnaB/tyrP permease subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: In strain W3110, the sequence is interrupted by the
    insertion of an IS5 element between positions 291 and 292.
