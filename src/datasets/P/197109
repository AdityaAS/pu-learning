"A polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region and a Met229-->Leu
variant in exon 5 of the human UCP1 gene are associated with

"Uncoupling protein 1 and 3 polymorphisms are associated with waist-

-!- FUNCTION: UCP are mitochondrial transporter proteins that create
    proton leaks across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus
    uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis. As a
    result, energy is dissipated in the form of heat.
-!- SUBUNIT: Acts as a dimer forming a proton channel.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brown adipose tissue.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: The Thr-64 polymorphism is associated with an
    increased waist-to-hip ratio. The Leu-229 polymorphism is
    associated with susceptibility to type II diabetes mellitus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
