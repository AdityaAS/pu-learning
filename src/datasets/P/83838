-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity iron transporter that plays a key role in
    the uptake of iron from the rhizosphere across the plasma membrane
    in the root epidermal layer. Acts as the principal regulator of
    iron homeostasis in planta. Also mediates the heavy metals uptake
    under iron-deficiency by its ability to transport cobalt, cadmium,
    manganese and/or zinc ions.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.

    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;

      IsoId=Q38856-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q38856-2; Sequence=VSP_008361, VSP_008362;
      Note=May be due to an intron retention;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the external cell layers of the
    root including the lateral branching zone. Also detected in
    flowers before pollination.
-!- INDUCTION: In roots by iron starvation.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibited by cadmium and Fe(2+) ions and at 100-
    fold excess inhibited by cobalt, manganese and zinc ions. Loss-of-
    function mutant exhibits a lethal chlorotic phenotype.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ZIP transporter (TC 2.A.5) family.
