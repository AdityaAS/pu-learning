AC   Q58439;
Magnesium transport protein corA.
"Complete genome sequence of the methanogenic archaeon, Methanococcus
jannaschii.";
"Functional similarity between archaeal and bacterial CorA magnesium
transporters.";
"Cation hexaammines are selective and potent inhibitors of the CorA
magnesium transport system.";
"The CorA Mg2+ transporter is a homotetramer.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates influx of magnesium ions.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by cation hexaammines.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the corA metal ion transporter (MIT)
    (TC 1.A.35) family.
