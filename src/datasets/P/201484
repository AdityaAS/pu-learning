Vacuolar ATP synthase subunit D (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-ATPase D subunit)
(Vacuolar proton pump D subunit).
"VMA8 encodes a 32-kDa V1 subunit of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
vacuolar H(+)-ATPase required for function and assembly of the enzyme
complex.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome V.";
"A bovine cDNA and a yeast gene (VMA8) encoding the subunit D of the
vacuolar H(+)-ATPase.";
"Skp1 forms multiple protein complexes, including RAVE, a regulator of
V-ATPase assembly.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Subunit of the peripheral V1 complex of vacuolar ATPase.
    V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying a variety of intracellular
    compartments in eukaryotic cells, thus providing most of the
    energy required for transport processes in the vacuolar system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (components A to H) attached to an
    integral membrane V0 proton pore complex (components: a, c, c',
    c'', d and e). Interacts with RAV1 and RAV2 components of the RAVE
    complex, which are essential for the stability and assembly of V-
    ATPase.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P47104:RAV1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-20264, EBI-25471;
    Q03956:RAV2; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-20264, EBI-30629;
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 8500 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase D subunit family.
