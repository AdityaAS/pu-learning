AC   P37083;
Sorbose permease IID component (PTS system sorbose-specific EIID
component) (EIID-Sor).
"Sequence of the sor-operon for L-sorbose utilization from Klebsiella
pneumoniae KAY2026.";
"Molecular analysis of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent L-sorbose:
phosphotransferase system from Klebsiella pneumoniae and of its
multidomain structure.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in sorbose transport.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIID domain, with its homologous EIIC domain, forms
    the PTS system translocation channel and contains part of its
    specific substrate-binding site.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIID domain.
