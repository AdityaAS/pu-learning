Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit beta-1 (K(+) channel subunit
beta-1) (Kv-beta-1).
"Mouse brain potassium channel beta1 subunit mRNA: cloning and
distribution during development.";
"A new K+ channel beta subunit to specifically enhance Kv2.2 (CDRK)
expression.";
"Expression of a potassium channel beta-subunit in mouse
fibroblasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Accessory potassium channel protein which modulates the
    activity of the pore-forming alpha subunit. Alter the functional
    properties of Kv1.1 and Kv1.4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms heteromultimeric complex with alpha subunits.
    Interacts with SQSTM1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominantly expressed in brain. No
    expression found in heart, skeletal muscle or kidney. In the late
    embryonic and early neonatal brain, highly expressed in
    hippocampus, cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, colliculus and
    cerebellum.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed from embryonic day 16. Expressed
    throughout embryonic development, in neonate and in adult.
-!- DOMAIN: Alteration of functional properties of alpha subunit is
    mediated through N-terminal domain of beta subunit (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the shaker potassium channel beta subunit
    family.
