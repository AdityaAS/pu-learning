-!- FUNCTION: Constitutive NADPH oxidase which generates superoxide
    intracellularly upon formation of a complex with CYBA/p22phox.
    Regulates signaling cascades probably through phosphatases
    inhibition. May function as an oxygen sensor regulating the
    KCNK3/TASK-1 potassium channel and HIF1A activity. May regulate
    insulin signaling cascade. May play a role in apoptosis, bone
    resorption and lipolysaccharide-mediated activation of NFKB.
    Isoform 3 is not functional. Isoform 4 displays an increased
    activity while isoform 5 and isoform 6 display reduced activity.
    May produce superoxide in the nucleus and play a role in
    regulating gene expression upon cell stimulation.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by plumbagin (By similarity).
    Activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Activated by
    insulin. Inhibited by diphenylene iodonium.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with protein disulfide isomerase (By
    similarity). Interacts with, relocalizes and stabilizes
    CYBA/p22phox. Interacts with TLR4.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Cell membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein (Probable). Cell junction; focal adhesion
    (Probable). Nucleus (Probable). Note=May localize to plasma
    membrane and focal adhesions. May also localize to the nucleus
    (Ref.14).

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by distal tubular cells in kidney
    cortex and in endothelial cells (at protein level). Widely
    expressed. Strongly expressed in kidney and to a lower extent in
    heart, adipocytes, hepatoma, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle,
    brain, several brain tumor cell lines and airway epithelial cells.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed in fetal kidney and fetal liver.
-!- INDUCTION: By 7-ketocholesterol (at protein level).
-!- PTM: Isoform 3 and isoform 4 are N-glycosylated. Isoform 4
    glycosylation is required for its proper function.
