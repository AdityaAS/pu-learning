"Identification and characterization of genes induced during sexual
differentiation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"S.pombe chromosome II cosmid 1228 sequence.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Transcribed specifically during sexual
    development.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the oligopeptide OPT transporter family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (BAA12193) sequence differs from that shown due to
    several frameshifts.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (BAA12193) sequence differs from that shown due to
    sequencing errors.
