typhimurium: gene sequences and deduced protein sequences.";

LT2.";

typhimurium and identification of the FliE protein as a component of
the flagellar hook-basal body complex.";
-!- FUNCTION: The M ring may be actively involved in energy
    transduction.
-!- SUBUNIT: The basal body constitutes a major portion of the
    flagellar organelle and consists of four rings (L,P,S, and M)
    mounted on a central rod. The M ring is integral to the inner
    membrane of the cell and may be connected to the flagellar rod via
    the S ring. The S (supramembrane ring) lies just distal to the M
    ring. The L and P rings lie in the outer membrane and the
    periplasmic space, respectively.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fliF family.
