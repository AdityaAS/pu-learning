-!- FUNCTION: Part of a complex that catalyzes the formation of
    methyl-coenzyme M and tetrahydromethanopterin from coenzyme M and
    methyl-tetrahydromethanopterin. This is an energy-conserving,
    sodium-ion translocating step.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin + 2-
    mercaptoethanesulfonate = 5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin + 2-
    (methylthio)ethanesulfonate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 5'-hydroxybenzimidazolyl-cobamide group.
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis from carbon dioxide; sixth step.
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of 8 subunits; mtrA, mtrB, mtrC,
    mtrD, mtrE, mtrF, mtrG and mtrH.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mtrA family.
