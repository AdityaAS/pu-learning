AC   Q52813; Q1MH72;
General L-amino acid transport system permease protein aapQ.
"The general L-amino acid permease of Rhizobium leguminosarum is an
ABC uptake system that also influences efflux of solutes.";
"The genome of Rhizobium leguminosarum has recognizable core and
accessory components.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a binding-protein-dependent transport system for
    L-amino acids, affects the uptake as well as efflux of these amino
    acids. Probably responsible for the translocation of the substrate
    across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. HisMQ subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
