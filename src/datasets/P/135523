Glucose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA component (EC 2.7.1.-)
(PTS system glucose-specific EIIA component) (EIIA-Glc) (EIII-Glc).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in glucose transport (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIA N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine +
    protein EIIB = protein EIIA + protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per glycerol kinase EIIA-Glc dimer. The
    zinc ion is important for dimerization (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIA domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr on a
    histidyl residue. Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the
    EIIB domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIA type-1 domain.
