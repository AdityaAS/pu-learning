AC   P05425;
Probable copper exporting ATPase B (EC 3.6.3.4).
"Primary structure of two P-type ATPases involved in copper
homeostasis in Enterococcus hirae.";
"Cloning of the K+-ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis. Structural and
evolutionary implications of its homology to the KdpB-protein of
Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: The copper-transporting proteins, CopA and CopB, are
    implicated in the regulation of cytoplasmic copper, copA being the
    importer and copB the exporter of the metal. They may probably
    serve as well for the import of other metals.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Cu(2+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    Cu(2+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By copper.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IB subfamily.
