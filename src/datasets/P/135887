AC   P46319;
Lichenan-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA component (EC 2.7.1.-)
(PTS system lichenan-specific EIIA component) (EIIA-Lic) (EIII-Lic).
"Identification and characterization of a new beta-glucoside
utilization system in Bacillus subtilis.";
"Sequencing of a 65 kb region of the Bacillus subtilis genome
containing the lic and cel loci, and creation of a 177 kb contig
covering the gnt-sacXY region.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in lichenan transport.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIA N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine +
    protein EIIB = protein EIIA + protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by lichenan, lichenan hydrolysate and
    cellobiose. Subject to carbon catabolite repression.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIA domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr on a
    histidyl residue. Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the
    EIIB domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIA type-3 domain.
