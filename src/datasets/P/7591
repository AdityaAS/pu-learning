AC   Q7SIF4; Q9R5F9;
Arsenite oxidase large subunit (EC 1.20.98.1) (AOI).
"Crystal structure of the 100 kDa arsenite oxidase from Alcaligenes
faecalis in two crystal forms at 1.64 A and 2.03 A.";
"The purification and characterization of arsenite oxidase from
Alcaligenes faecalis, a molybdenum-containing hydroxylase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the detoxification of arsenic. Oxidizes
    As(III)O3(3-) (arsenite) to the somewhat less toxic As(V)O4(3-)
    (arsenate).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Arsenite + H(2)O + azurin(ox) = arsenate +
    azurin(red).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 molybdenum ion per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 molybdopterin guanosine dinuleotide (MGD) group
    per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 3Fe-4S cluster per subunit.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer consisting of a large and a small subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family.
