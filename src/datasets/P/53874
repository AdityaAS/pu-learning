-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for ferric enterobactin. Probably responsible for energy coupling
    to the transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
