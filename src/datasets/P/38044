Cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein czcC precursor (Cation efflux
system protein czcC).
"Expression and nucleotide sequence of a plasmid-determined divalent
cation efflux system from Alcaligenes eutrophus.";
"Sequence and features of the Ralstonia metallidurans CH34 heavy
metals plasmids pMOL28 and pMOL30.";
"Complete sequence of plasmid pMOL30 of Ralstonia metallidurans
CH34.";
"The czc operon of Alcaligenes eutrophus CH34: from resistance
mechanism to the removal of heavy metals.";
-!- FUNCTION: CzcC protein appears to modify the specificity of the
    system, perhaps by acting on the czcB protein. When the czcC
    protein is added to czcA and czcB, the efflux system gains
    specificity for cadmium and cobalt.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: By zinc, cadmium and cobalt (zinc being the best and
    cobalt being the worst inducer).
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: In the presence of 2 mM Cd(2+) or 4-10 mM Zn(2+) up
    to 99% of the metal is removed from the culture supernatant and is
    sequestered via bioprecipitation. Additionally Cu(2+), Co(2+),
    Ni(2+), Pb(2+), Y(3+) and Ge(4+) can also be removed from culture
    supernatants, although it is not clear which efflux system is
    responsible for all these substrates (Ref.4).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the outer membrane factor (OMF) (TC 1.B.17)
    family.
