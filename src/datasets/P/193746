-!- FUNCTION: Calcium selective cation channel probably involved in
    Ca(2+) uptake in various tissues, including Ca(2+) reabsorption in
    intestine. The channel is activated by low internal calcium level,
    probably including intracellular calcium store depletion, and the
    current exhibits an inward rectification. Inactivation includes
    both, a rapid Ca(2+)-dependent and a slower Ca(2+)-calmodulin-
    dependent mechanism, the latter may be regulated by
    phosphorylation. In vitro, is slowly inhibited by Mg(2+) in a
    voltage-independent manner. Heteromeric assembly with TRPV5 seems
    to modify channel properties. TRPV5-TRPV6 heteromultimeric
    concatemers exhibit voltage-dependent gating (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer and probably heterotetramer with TRPV5.
    Interacts with TRPV5. Interacts with S100A10 and probably with the
    ANAX2-S100A10 heterotetramer. The interaction with S100A10 is
    required for the trafficking to the plasma membrane. Interacts
    with BSPRY (By similarity). Interacts with calmodulin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).

      IsoId=Q9H1D0-2; Sequence=VSP_013439;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed at high levels in the
    gastrointestinal tract, including esophagus, stomach, duodenum,
    jejunum, ileum and colon, and in pancreas, placenta, prostate and
    salivary gland. Expressed at moderate levels in liver, kidney and
    testis. Expressed in locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic
    and androgen-insensitive prostatic lesions but not detected in
    healthy prostate tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylation by PRKCA at the calmodulin binding site
    delays channel inactivation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. TrpV
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 ANK repeats.
