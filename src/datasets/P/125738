AC   P80563; Q9S354;
Pyrogallol hydroxytransferase large subunit (EC 1.97.1.2)
(Transhydroxylase subunit alpha).
"One molecule of molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide is associated with
each subunit of the heterodimeric Mo-Fe-S protein transhydroxylase of
Pelobacter acidigallici as determined by SDS/PAGE and mass
spectrometry.";
"Towards the reaction mechanism of pyrogallol-phloroglucinol
transhydroxylase of Pelobacter acidigallici.";
-!- FUNCTION: Isomerisation of pyrogallol to phloroglucin.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene + 1,2,3-
    trihydroxybenzene = 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene + 1,2,3,5-
    tetrahydroxybenzene.
-!- COFACTOR: Molybdenum (molybdopterin).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a large and a small subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family.
