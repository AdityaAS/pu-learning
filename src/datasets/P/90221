AC   P29822;
Lactose-binding protein precursor (LBP).
"Molecular analysis of the lac operon encoding the binding-protein-
dependent lactose transport system and beta-galactosidase in
Agrobacterium radiobacter.";
"Binding-protein-dependent lactose transport in Agrobacterium
radiobacter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for lactose.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- INDUCTION: By lactose and various galactosides, and subject to
    catabolite repression by glucose, galactose and succinate. In
    strain AR50 the expression of the lac operon is constitutive.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 1
    family.
