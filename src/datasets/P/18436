AC   Q52666;
Glutamate/glutamine/aspartate/asparagine transport ATP-binding protein
bztD.
"A glutamate/glutamine/aspartate/asparagine transport operon in
Rhodobacter capsulatus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a binding-protein-dependent transport system for
    glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, asparagine. Probably responsible
    for energy coupling to the transport system.
-!- SUBUNIT: BztB and bztC form a heterodimer which can form a
    membrane complex with a homodimer of bztD (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
