-!- FUNCTION: Mechanosensitive channel that opens in response to
    stretch forces in the membrane lipid bilayer. May participate in
    the regulation of osmotic pressure changes within the cell,
    although it does not appear to have a major role in osmolarity
    regulation. Forms an ion channel of 1.0 nanosiemens conductance.
    The channel can remain active for between 30 seconds and over 3
    minutes; it does not desensitize upon extended pressure. Its
    activity is masked in wild-type cells by the mscS channel.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mscS (TC 1.A.23) family.
