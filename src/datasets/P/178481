AC   P53391;
High affinity sulfate transporter 1.
"Plant members of a family of sulfate transporters reveal functional
subtypes.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity H(+)/sulfate cotransporter that mediates
    the uptake of sulfate by plant roots from low concentrations of
    sulfate in the soil solution.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC26A/SulP transporter (TC 2.A.53)
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 STAS domain.
