Caerin-1.1 [Contains: Caerin-1.1.1; Caerin-1.1.3; Caerin-1.1.5;
Caerin-1.1.6; Caerin-1.1.7; Caerin-1.1.8].
"Peptides from Australian frogs. The structures of the caerins and
caeridins from Litoria gilleni.";
-!- FUNCTION: Antibacterial and antiviral peptides that adopt an alpha
    helical conformation which can disrupt bacterial membranes. Each
    caerin displays a different antimicrobial specificity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the skin parotoid and/or rostral
    glands.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains two amphipathic alpha helix regions separated by
    a region of less-defined helicity and greater flexibility.
-!- PTM: The major product is Caerin-1.1; in addition, different
    peptides are produced that are missing some amino acid residues at
    the N-terminus or C-terminus. Caerin-1.1.1 is inactive.

-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=915; METHOD=FAB; RANGE=1-10; NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the frog skin active peptide (FSAP) family.
    Caerin subfamily.
