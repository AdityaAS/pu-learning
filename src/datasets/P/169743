complex subunit beta).

SEB2 encoding proteins homologous to the Sec61 beta subunit.";

-!- FUNCTION: Part of the Ssh1 complex, which probably is the major
    component of a channel-forming translocon complex that may
    function exclusively in the cotranslational pathway of protein
    endoplasmic reticulum (ER) import.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the heterotrimeric Ssh1 complex, which is
    composed of SSH1, SEB2 and SSS1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; single-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 414 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SEC61-beta family.
