AC   P28572;
Sodium- and chloride-dependent glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) (GlyT-1)
(Solute carrier family 6 member 9).
"Cloning, expression, and localization of a rat brain high-affinity
glycine transporter.";
"Cloning and expression of a glycine transporter reveal colocalization
with NMDA receptors.";
"Two glycine transporter variants with distinct localization in the
CNS and peripheral tissues are encoded by a common gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Terminates the action of glycine by its high affinity
    sodium-dependent reuptake into presynaptic terminals. May play a
    role in regulation of glycine levels in NMDA receptor-mediated
    neurotransmission.
-!- INTERACTION:

    Name=2; Synonyms=GlyT-1B, GlyT-1;
      IsoId=P28572-2; Sequence=VSP_006273;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: GLYT-1A is found in the gray matter of CNS as
    well as in macrophages and mast cells in peripherical tissues.
    GLYT-1B is only found in the white matter of CNS.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
