Outer membrane usher protein papC precursor.
"Nucleotide sequence, regulation and functional analysis of the papC
gene required for cell surface localization of Pap pili of
uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
"Horizontal gene transfer of the Escherichia coli pap and prs pili
operons as a mechanism for the development of tissue-specific adhesive
properties.";
"Bacterial outer membrane ushers contain distinct targeting and
assembly domains for pilus biogenesis.";
"PapD, a periplasmic transport protein in P-pilus biogenesis.";
"Chaperone-assisted self-assembly of pili independent of cellular
energy.";
"The PapC usher forms an oligomeric channel: implications for pilus
biogenesis across the outer membrane.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the export and assembly of pili subunits
    across the outer membrane. Forms a hexameric ring-shaped pore in
    the outer bacterial membrane. The 2 nanometer-diameter pore allows
    the passage of the thin tip fibrillum. As for the rod, it probably
    unwinds into linear fibers which would therefore be narrow enough
    to pass through the pore.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fimbrial export usher family.
