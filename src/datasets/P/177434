-!- FUNCTION: STE6 is required in yeast MATA cells for production of
    A-factor pheromone. STE6 is involved in the transport of the
    farnesyl-derivation of the A-factor pheromone.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- PTM: Degraded via the ubiquitin system.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transmembrane type-1 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
