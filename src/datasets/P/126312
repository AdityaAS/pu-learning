AC   P38361;
Phosphate permease PHO89 (Na(+)/Pi cotransporter PHO89).
"Complete DNA sequence of yeast chromosome II.";
"Identification, cloning and characterization of a derepressible Na+-
coupled phosphate transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium-phosphate symporter. Active in early growth
    phase.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=0.5 uM for phosphate;
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 9.5;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: The gene for PHO89 is only transcribed under conditions
    of phosphate limitation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pho-4 transporter (TC 2.A.20.2.2)
    family.
