-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the transport of C4-dicarboxylates
    during anaerobic growth.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dcuC/dcuD transporter (TC 2.A.61)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 and Ref.5 sequences differ from that shown due to
    the presence of an IS5 insertion element between codons 327 and
    328. Strain W3110A but not W3110B harbors this IS5 insertion.
