AC   Q99134;
PYLa/PGLa precursor [Contains: PYLa; PGLa].
"A novel peptide designated PYLa and its precursor as predicted from
cloned mRNA of Xenopus laevis skin.";
"The genes for the frog skin peptides GLa, xenopsin, levitide and
caerulein contain a homologous export exon encoding a signal sequence
and part of an amphiphilic peptide.";
"Biosynthesis and degradation of peptides derived from Xenopus laevis
prohormones.";
"Antimicrobial peptides in the stomach of Xenopus laevis.";
-!- FUNCTION: PGLa is an antimicrobial peptide.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Synthesized in the stomach and stored in a
    novel granular multinucleated cell in the gastric mucosa. It is
    stored as active, processed peptides in large granules within the
    granular gland secretions of the skin.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The sequence shown is that of clone pUF38.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gastrin/cholecystokinin family.
    Magainin subfamily.
Amidation; Amphibian defense peptide; Antibiotic; Antimicrobial;
