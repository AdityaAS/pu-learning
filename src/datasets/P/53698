dehydrogenase iron-sulfur subunit).

-!- FUNCTION: Formate dehydrogenase allows E.coli to use formate as
    major electron donor during anaerobic respiration, when nitrate is
    used as electron acceptor. The beta chain is an electron transfer
    unit containing 4 cysteine clusters involved in the formation of
    iron-sulfur centers. Electrons are transferred from the gamma
    chain to the molybdenum cofactor of the alpha subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 4 4Fe-4S clusters per subunit.
-!- PATHWAY: Anaerobic nitrate respiration.
-!- SUBUNIT: Trimer of heterotrimers, consisting of subunits alpha,
    beta and gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrate under anaerobic conditions.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The 4Fe-4S clusters from Ref.5 are renumbered in
    standard order.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
