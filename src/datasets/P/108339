-!- FUNCTION: Has strong cytotoxic and hemolytic activities. Is more
    potent against mononuclear leukocytes than against granulocytes.
    The synthesized peptide 57-76 shows a potent and broad spectrum
    antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-
    negative bacteria, and also against the fungus C.albicans. Adopts
    an alpha-helical structure.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=4938; METHOD=Electrospray; RANGE=68-112;
    NOTE=Ref.6.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=5279; METHOD=Electrospray; RANGE=65-112;
    NOTE=Ref.6.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=6052; METHOD=Electrospray; RANGE=57-112;
    NOTE=Ref.6.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=6067; METHOD=Electrospray; RANGE=57-112;
    NOTE=Variant (Ref.6).
-!- ALLERGEN: Causes an allergic reaction in human. Binds to IgE.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pilosulin family.
