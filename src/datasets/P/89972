Voltage-gated potassium channel (KvAP).

crenarchaeon, Aeropyrum pernix K1.";

channel.";
"X-ray structure of a voltage-dependent K(+) channel.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates a strong voltage-dependent potassium ion
    permeability of excitable membranes. Assuming opened or closed
    conformations in response to the voltage difference across the
    membrane, the protein forms a potassium-selective channel through
    which potassium ions may pass in accordance with their
    electrochemical gradient.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains a central ion-conduction pore surrounded by four
    voltage sensors which form the voltage-sensor paddles that move in
    response to membrane voltage changes through the fluid membrane
    interior, each voltage-sensor carrying their four positive charges
    across the membrane. It is thought that the S4 arginine residues
    move through the membrane's electric field to open the pore.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family.
