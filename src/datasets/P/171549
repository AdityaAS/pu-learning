AC   Q9S1G7;
Selenate reductase subunit gamma precursor (EC 1.97.1.9) (Selenate
reductase heme subunit).
"Cloning and sequencing of the genes encoding the periplasmic-
cytochrome B-containing selenate reductase of Thauera selenatis.";
"Purification and characterization of the selenate reductase from
Thauera selenatis.";
-!- FUNCTION: May transfer electrons to the iron-sulfur centers of
    serB.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Selenite + H(2)O + acceptor = selenate +
    reduced acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 heme B (iron-protoporphyrin IX) group per
    subunit (Potential).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimer of alpha, beta and gamma subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Has potential use in bioremediation of waste sites
    contaminated with selenate, such as agricultural drainage waters.
