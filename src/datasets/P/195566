AC   P32089;
Tricarboxylate transport protein, mitochondrial precursor (Citrate
transport protein) (CTP) (Tricarboxylate carrier protein) (Solute
carrier family 25 member 1).
"The mitochondrial tricarboxylate transport protein. cDNA cloning,
primary structure, and comparison with other mitochondrial transport
proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in citrate-H+/malate exchange. Important for
    the bioenergetics of hepatic cells as it provides a carbon source
    for fatty acid and sterol biosyntheses, and NAD+ for the
    glycolytic pathway.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
