"The fadD gene of Escherichia coli K12 is located close to rnd at 39.6
min of the chromosomal map and is a new member of the AMP-binding
protein family.";
"Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the fadD gene of Escherichia
coli encoding acyl coenzyme A synthetase.";
"A 460-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 40.1-50.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains

"Functional role of fatty acyl-coenzyme A synthetase in the
transmembrane movement and activation of exogenous long-chain fatty
acids. Amino acid residues within the ATP/AMP signature motif of
Escherichia coli FadD are required for enzyme activity and fatty acid
transport.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the esterification, concomitant with
    transport, of exogenous long-chain fatty acids into metabolically
    active CoA thioesters for subsequent degradation or incorporation
    into phospholipids.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a long-chain carboxylic acid + CoA = AMP
    + diphosphate + an acyl-CoA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By
    similarity). Note=Partially membrane-associated (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Activity is the highest with fatty acid substrates
    of > 10 carbon atoms.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATP-dependent AMP-binding enzyme
    family.
