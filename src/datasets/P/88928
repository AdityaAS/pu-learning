Polysialic acid transport protein kpsD precursor.
"Nucleotide sequence and mutational analysis of the gene encoding
KpsD, a periplasmic protein involved in transport of polysialic acid
in Escherichia coli K1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the translocation of the polysialic acid
    capsule across the outer membrane to the cell surface. May
    function as the periplasmic binding element of the PSA transport
    system, in which it transiently interacts with the membrane
    component of the transporter, binds polysaccharide and transports
    the polymer to a component in the outer membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: To E.coli K5 kpsD.
