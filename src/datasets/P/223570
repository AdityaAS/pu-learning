-!- FUNCTION: Probably part of a binding-protein-dependent transport
    system yecCS for an amino acid. Probably responsible for energy
    coupling to the transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
