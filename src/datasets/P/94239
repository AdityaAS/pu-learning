-!- FUNCTION: Participates in the translocation of lipoproteins from
    the inner membrane to the outer membrane. Only forms a complex
    with a lipoprotein if the residue after the N-terminal Cys is not
    an aspartate (The Asp acts as a targeting signal to indicate that
    the lipoprotein should stay in the inner membrane); the inner
    membrane retention signal functions at the release step.
-!- FUNCTION: May act as a regulator of the RCS-phosphorelay signal
    transduction pathway.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P69776:lpp; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-553532, EBI-909750;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lolA family.
