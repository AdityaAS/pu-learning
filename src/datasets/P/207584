-!- FUNCTION: Uptake of D-xylose across the boundary membrane with the
    concomitant transport of protons into the cell (symport system).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By xylose.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: E.coli has two D-xylose transport systems that
    accumulate sugar against a concentration gradient: the xylE system
    which utilizes the electrochemical gradient of protons and that is
    insensitive to cold osmotic shock and the xylF system that uses a
    high-energy phosphate compound and is sensitive to cold osmotic
    shock.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
