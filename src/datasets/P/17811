AC   P25185;
Branched chain amino acid transport system III carrier protein (LIV-
III).
"Isolation of the braZ gene encoding the carrier for a novel branched-
chain amino acid transport system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO.";
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the LIV-III transport system for branched-
    chain amino acids. BraZ is specific for isoleucine and valine. The
    LIV-III transport system may be H(+)-coupled.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the braC/braZ/brnQ transporter family.
