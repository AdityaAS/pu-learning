Solute carrier family 12 member 6 (Electroneutral potassium-chloride
cotransporter 3) (K-Cl cotransporter 3).
"Molecular cloning and functional characterization of KCC3, a new K-Cl
cotransporter.";
"Cloning, characterization, and chromosomal location of a novel human
K+-Cl- cotransporter.";
"Cloning and characterization of KCC3 and KCC4, new members of the
cation-chloride cotransporter gene family.";
"The K-Cl cotransporter KCC3 is mutant in a severe peripheral
neuropathy associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum.";
"A dominant negative mutant of the KCC1 K-Cl cotransporter: both N-
and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains are required for K-Cl cotransport
activity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates electroneutral potassium-chloride cotransport.
    May be activated by cell swelling. May contribute to cell volume
    homeostasis in single cells.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homomultimer and heteromultimer with other K-Cl
    cotransporters (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1; Synonyms=KCC3a;
      IsoId=Q9UHW9-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2; Synonyms=KCC3b;
      IsoId=Q9UHW9-2; Sequence=VSP_006115, VSP_006116;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in heart, brain and kidney.
    Detected at lower levels in skeletal muscle, placenta, lung and
    pancreas. Detected in umbilical vein endothelial cells.
-!- INDUCTION: Up-regulated by VEGF. Down-regulated by TNF.
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in SLC12A6 are a cause of agenesis of the corpus
    callosum with peripheral neuropathy (ACCPN) [MIM:218000]. ACCPN is
    characterized by severe progressive sensorimotor neuropathy,
    mental retardation, dysmorphic features and complete or partial
    agenesis of the corpus callosum.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Activated by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Inhibited by
    DIOA, bumetanide and furosemide.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC12A transporter family.
