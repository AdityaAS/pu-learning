Mannose permease IIC component (PTS system mannose-specific EIIC
component) (EIIC-Man) (EII-P-Man).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in mannose transport (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIC domain forms the PTS system translocation channel
    and contains the specific substrate-binding site.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIC type-4 domain.
