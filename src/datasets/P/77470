30 kDa heat shock protein.
"Isolation and sequence of HSP30, a yeast heat-shock gene coding for a
hydrophobic membrane protein.";

"A global topology map of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably cooperates with other heat shock proteins in
    the translocation of polypeptides through membranes. It may
    counteract the altering effect of heat shock on the plasma
    membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed during the entry into stationary
    phase resulting from glucose limitation.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 7800 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the archaeal/bacterial/fungal opsin family.
