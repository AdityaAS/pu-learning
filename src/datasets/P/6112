-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    alsBAC for D-allose. Probably responsible for energy coupling to
    the transport system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + monosaccharide(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + monosaccharide(In).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0A6F5:groL; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-562166, EBI-543750;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MglA subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
