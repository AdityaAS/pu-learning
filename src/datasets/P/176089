AC   P37108;
Signal recognition particle 14 kDa protein (SRP14) (18 kDa Alu RNA-
binding protein).
"The SRP9/14 subunit of the signal recognition particle (SRP) is
present in more than 20-fold excess over SRP in primate cells and
exists primarily free but also in complex with small cytoplasmic Alu
RNAs.";
"A human Alu RNA-binding protein whose expression is associated with
accumulation of small cytoplasmic Alu RNA.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Signal-recognition-particle assembly has a crucial role
    in targeting secretory proteins to the rough endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane. SRP9 together with SRP14 and the Alu portion of the SRP
    RNA, constitutes the elongation arrest domain of SRP. The complex
    of SRP9 and SRP14 is required for SRP RNA binding.
-!- SUBUNIT: Signal recognition particle consists of a 7S RNA molecule
    of 300 nucleotides and six protein subunits: SRP72, SRP68, SRP54,
    SRP19, SRP14 and SRP9.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SRP14 family.
