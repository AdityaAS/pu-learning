-!- FUNCTION: Probable maltose transporter. Essential for the
    conversion of starch to sucrose in leaves at night, probably via
    the export of maltose from the chloroplast. Required for root cap
    cells formation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast inner
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in leaves and roots. Expressed in
    root cap cells.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
