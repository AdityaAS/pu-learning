AC   P41943; Q96VC8;
Glyoxylate pathway regulator.
"Ylt1, a highly repetitive retrotransposon in the genome of the
dimorphic fungus Yarrowia lipolytica.";
"Characterization, localization and functional analysis of Gpr1p, a
protein affecting sensitivity to acetic acid in the yeast Yarrowia
lipolytica.";
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in the adaptation of cell metabolism to the
    utilization of acetic acid, possibly by inhibiting an anion-
    transporting ATPase and affecting the plasma membrane H+-ATPase.
    May be indirectly involved in the repression of genes encoding
    glyoxylate cycle enzymes.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By acetic acid and ethanol.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GPR1/FUN34/yaaH family.
