AC   Q52665;
Glutamate/glutamine/aspartate/asparagine transport system permease
protein bztC.
"A glutamate/glutamine/aspartate/asparagine transport operon in
Rhodobacter capsulatus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a binding-protein-dependent transport system for
    glutamate, glutamine, aspartate and asparagine. Probably
    responsible for the translocation of the substrate across the
    membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: BztB and bztC form a heterodimer which can form a
    membrane complex with a homodimer of bztD (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. HisMQ subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
