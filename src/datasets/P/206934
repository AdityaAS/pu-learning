AC   Q9WTR6;
Cystine/glutamate transporter (Amino acid transport system xc-) (xCT).
"Cloning and expression of a plasma membrane cystine/glutamate
exchange transporter composed of two distinct proteins.";
"Electrophile response element-mediated induction of the
cystine/glutamate exchange transporter gene expression.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium-independent, high-affinity exchange of anionic
    amino acids with high specificity for anionic form of cystine and
    glutamate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Disulfide-linked heterodimer with the amino acid
    transport protein SLC3A2/4F2hc.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) (TC 2.A.3.8)
    family.
