-!- FUNCTION: Component of the peroxisomal translocation machinery
    with PEX14 and PEX17. Functions as a docking factor for the
    predominantly cytoplasmic PTS1 receptor (PAS10/PEX5). Involved in
    the import of PTS1 and PTS2 proteins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PEX19.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P40855:PEX19; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-594849, EBI-594747;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Peroxisome; peroxisomal membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PEX13 are a cause of peroxisome biogenesis
    disorder complementation group H (CGH) [MIM:601789].
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PEX13 are a cause of neonatal
    adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD) [MIM:202370]; a peroxisomal biogenesis
    disorder (PBD).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SH3 domain.
-!- CAUTION: It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-40 is the initiator.
