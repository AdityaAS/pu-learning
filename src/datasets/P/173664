Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1A5 (Solute
carrier family 21 member 7) (Sodium-independent organic anion
transporter 3) (Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 3) (OATP3).
"Molecular characterization and tissue distribution of a new organic
anion transporter subtype (oatp3) that transports thyroid hormones and
taurocholate and comparison with oatp2.";
"Expression, transport properties, and chromosomal location of organic
anion transporter subtype 3.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the Na(+)-independent transport of organic
    anions such as taurocholate and thyroid hormones.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in the kidney and moderately
    abundant in the retina.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the organo anion transporter (TC 2.A.60)
    family.
