Apocytochrome f precursor.
"Primary structure of the psbN-psbH-petC-petA gene cluster of the
cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803.";
"Sequence analysis of the genome of the unicellular cyanobacterium
Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. II. Sequence determination of the
entire genome and assignment of potential protein-coding regions.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the cytochrome b6-f complex, which mediates
    electron transfer between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I
    (PSI), cyclic electron flow around PSI, and state transitions (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The 4 large subunits of the cytochrome b6-f complex are
    cytochrome b6, subunit IV (17 kDa polypeptide, petD), cytochrome f
    and the Rieske protein, while the 4 small subunits are petG, petL,
    petM and petN. The complex functions as a dimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cellular thylakoid membrane; single-pass
    membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome f family.
