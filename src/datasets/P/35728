-!- FUNCTION: Component of the cytochrome b6-f complex, which mediates
    electron transfer between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I
    (PSI), cyclic electron flow around PSI, and state transitions (By
    similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 heme groups. One heme group is bound covalently
    by a single cysteine link, the other one non-covalently (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The 4 large subunits of the cytochrome b6-f complex are
    cytochrome b6, subunit IV (17 kDa polypeptide, petD), cytochrome f
    and the Rieske protein, while the 4 small subunits are petG, petL,
    petM and petN. The complex functions as a dimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cellular thylakoid membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Heme 1 (or BH or b566) is high-potential and
    absorbs at about 566 nm, and heme 2 (or BL or b562) is low-
    potential and absorbs at about 562 nm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome b family. PetB subfamily.
