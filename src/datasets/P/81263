protease).

IgA protease.";

gonorrhoeae generated by horizontal genetic exchange in vivo.";

Hemophilus influenzae by peptide prolyl boronic acids.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protease is specific for immunoglobulin A.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cleavage of immunoglobulin A molecules at
    certain Pro-|-Xaa bonds in the hinge region. No small molecule
    substrates are known.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The signal peptide guides the precursor to the periplasmic
    space, and the C-terminal helper domain associates with the outer
    membrane to form a pore for excretion of the protease domain. The
    helper domain is then released by autoproteolysis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 autotransporter (TC 1.B.12) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase S6 domain.
