-!- FUNCTION: When overexpressed, kills the cells from the inside by
    interfering with a vital function in the cell membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer; disulfide-linked.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass type II
    membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hok/gef family.
