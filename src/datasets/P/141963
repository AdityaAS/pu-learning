-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex rbsABCD involved in
    ribose import. Responsible for energy coupling to the transport
    system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + monosaccharide(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + monosaccharide(In).
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=140 uM for ATP;
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (rbsA), two transmembrane proteins (rbsC and rbsD) and a solute-
    binding protein (rbsB) (Probable).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0A850:tig; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1132449, EBI-544862;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Ribose importer
    (TC 3.A.1.2.1) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
