"Sequence analysis of the phs operon in Salmonella typhimurium and the
contribution of thiosulfate reduction to anaerobic energy
metabolism.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Cloning and characterization of a gene cluster, phsBCDEF, necessary
for the production of hydrogen sulfide from thiosulfate by Salmonella

-!- FUNCTION: Oxidoreductase which produces hydrogen sulfide from
    thiosulfate (Potential).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster (Potential).
-!- COFACTOR: Molybdenum (molybdopterin).
-!- SUBUNIT: Probably composed of three subunits: phsA, phsB and phsC.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family.
