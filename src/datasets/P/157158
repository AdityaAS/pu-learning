AC   P0ABG7; P13409; P15035;
Rod shape-determining protein rodA.
"Nucleotide sequence of the rodA gene, responsible for the rod shape
of Escherichia coli: rodA and the pbpA gene, encoding penicillin-
binding protein 2, constitute the rodA operon.";
"Sequence of minutes 4-25 of Escherichia coli.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Genes encoding two lipoproteins in the leuS-dacA region of the
Escherichia coli chromosome.";
"Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the proteins responsible for the rod
    shape of E.coli. Is required for the expression of the enzymatic
    activity of PBP2, which is thought to synthesize peptidoglycan in
    the step of initiation of cell elongation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ftsW/rodA/spoVE family.
