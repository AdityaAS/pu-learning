AC   P53788;
Sodium channel subunit beta-1 precursor.
"Cloning of the cDNA encoding the sodium channel beta 1 subunit from
rabbit.";
-!- FUNCTION: Crucial in the assembly, expression, and functional
    modulation of the heterotrimeric complex of the sodium channel.
    The subunit beta-1 can modulate multiple alpha subunit isoforms
    from brain, skeletal muscle, and heart. Its association with
    neurofascin may target the sodium channels to the nodes of Ranvier
    of developing axons and retain these channels at the nodes in
    mature myelinated axons (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The voltage-sensitive sodium channel consists of an ion
    conducting pore forming alpha-subunit regulated by one or more
    beta-1, beta-2 and beta-3. Beta-1 and beta-3 are non-covalently
    associated with alpha, while beta-2 is covalently linked by
    disulfide bonds. Beta-1 or beta-3 subunits associate with
    neurofascin. Associates with SCN10A (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
