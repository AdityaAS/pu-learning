Protein dif-1.
"Extension of the mitochondrial transporter super-family: sequences of
five members from the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans.";
"Embryonic tissue differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans requires
dif-1, a gene homologous to mitochondrial solute carriers.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to play a role in the maintenance of tissue
    differentiation in the developing embryo, but not for its
    initiation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (Potential).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Although dif-1 activity is required only
    during embryogenesis, it is expressed at all stages of
    development.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
