AC   P07198;
Xenopsin precursor [Contains: Xenopsin precursor fragment (XPF);
Xenopsin].
"Xenopsin: the neurotensin-like octapeptide from Xenopus skin at the
carboxyl terminus of its precursor.";
"Levitide, a neurohormone-like peptide from the skin of Xenopus
laevis. Peptide and peptide precursor cDNA sequences.";
"The genes for the frog skin peptides GLa, xenopsin, levitide and
caerulein contain a homologous export exon encoding a signal sequence
and part of an amphiphilic peptide.";
"Antimicrobial peptides in the stomach of Xenopus laevis.";
"Isolation and structure of a new active peptide 'Xenopsin' on the
smooth muscle, especially on a strip of fundus from a rat stomach,
from the skin of Xenopus laevis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Xenopsin is a neurotensin-like octapeptide.
-!- FUNCTION: XPF has antimicrobial activity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: XPF is synthesized in the stomach and stored
    in a novel granular multinucleated cell in the gastric mucosa, it
    is stored as active, processed peptides in large granules within
    the granular gland secretions of the skin.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gastrin/cholecystokinin family.
    Magainin subfamily.
