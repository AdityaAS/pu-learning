AC   P41233;
ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 1 (ATP-binding cassette
transporter 1) (ATP-binding cassette 1) (ABC-1).
"Cloning of two novel ABC transporters mapping on human chromosome
9.";

ABCG1 via an LXR-independent pathway.";

-!- FUNCTION: cAMP-dependent and sulfonylurea-sensitive anion
    transporter. Key gatekeeper influencing intracellular cholesterol
    transport (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed in adult tissues. Highest
    levels are found in pregnant uterus and uterus.
-!- INDUCTION: Down-regulated by endotoxins (LPS) or cytokines (TNF
    and IL-1) in J774 macrophages. The down-regulation by endotoxin in
    macrophages is not likely to be mediated by the liver X
    receptor/retinoic X receptor (LXR/RXR).
-!- DOMAIN: Multifunctional polypeptide with two homologous halves,
    each containing an hydrophobic membrane-anchoring domain and an
    ATP binding cassette (ABC) domain.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-2054 regulates phospholipid efflux (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. ABCA subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
