AC   Q62674;
Sodium/nucleoside cotransporter 1 (Na(+)/nucleoside cotransporter 1)
(Sodium-coupled nucleoside transporter 1) (Concentrative nucleoside
transporter 1) (CNT 1).
"Cloning and functional expression of a complementary DNA encoding a
mammalian nucleoside transport protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium-dependent and pyrimidine-selective. Exhibits the
    transport characteristics of the nucleoside transport system cit
    or N2 subtype (N2/cit) (selective for pyrimidine nucleosides and
    adenosine). It also transports the antiviral pyrimidine nucleoside
    analogs 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine
    (ddC). May be involved in the intestinal absorption and renal
    handling of pyrimidine nucleoside analogs used to treat acquired
    immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in kidney and jejenum.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC28A transporter family.
