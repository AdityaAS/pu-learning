AC   P0A4H0; P31159; Q31L25;
Preprotein translocase secY subunit.
"Cloning and characterization of the secY gene from the cyanobacterium
Synechococcus PCC7942.";
"Complete sequence of chromosome 1 of Synechococcus elongatus PCC
7942.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export. Interacts with secA and secE
    to allow the translocation of proteins across the plasma membrane,
    by forming part of a channel.
-!- SUBUNIT: One of seven secretory proteins (secA-F and secY) that
    comprise the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secY/SEC61-alpha family.
