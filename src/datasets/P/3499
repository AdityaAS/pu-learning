-!- FUNCTION: Transports acetate. Also able to transport glycolate.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=5.4 uM for acetate;
      Vmax=19.6 nmol/min/mg enzyme;
-!- SUBUNIT: Has been isolated from inner membrane preparations as a
    homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Although actP belongs to the sodium:solute
    symporter family, the experiments did not allow to show that
    acetate transport depends on sodium. The inhibition of acetate
    transport by the uncoupler CCCP indicates that the driving force
    used by actP is a transmembrane electrochemical potential.
    However, it does not allow to discriminate between hydrogen ion or
    sodium ion-coupled transporters.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:solute symporter (SSF)
    (TC 2.A.21) family.
