AC   P94363;
Citrate/malate transporter (Citrate/malate-proton symporter).
"Sequencing of a 65 kb region of the Bacillus subtilis genome
containing the lic and cel loci, and creation of a 177 kb contig
covering the gnt-sacXY region.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Bacillus subtilis YxkJ is a secondary transporter of the 2-
hydroxycarboxylate transporter family that transports L-malate and
citrate.";
-!- FUNCTION: Proton motive force-driven secondary transporter that
    catalyzes the uptake of both citrate and malate. Appears to be an
    electroneutral proton-solute symporter; the number of protons
    transported is equal to the valence of the transported anions. Is
    strictly stereoselective, translocating only the (S)-enantiomer of
    malate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: The uptake activity is inhibited by divalent
    metal ions such as Ca(2+), Mg(2+) and Ni(2+).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:citrate (SCF) symporter family.
