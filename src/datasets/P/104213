-!- FUNCTION: Mechanosensitive channel that opens in response to
    stretch forces in the membrane lipid bilayer. Participates in the
    regulation of osmotic pressure changes within the cell. Forms a
    nonselective ion channel of 2.5 nanosiemens conductance. Opens at
    a pressure just below that which would cause cell disruption and
    death.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homopentamer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mscL family.
