AC   P23212;
Erythromycin resistance ATP-binding protein msrA.
"Inducible erythromycin resistance in staphylococci is encoded by a
member of the ATP-binding transport super-gene family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Confers resistance to 14-membered ring macrolides (like
    erythromycin) and to B streptogramins, by acting as an ATP-
    dependent efflux pump.
-!- DOMAIN: Composed of two homologous domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
