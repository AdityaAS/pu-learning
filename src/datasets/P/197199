Cytochrome b6-f complex iron-sulfur subunit 2 (EC 1.10.99.1) (Rieske
iron-sulfur protein 2) (Plastohydroquinone:plastocyanin oxidoreductase
iron-sulfur protein 2) (ISP 2) (RISP 2).

-!- FUNCTION: Component of the cytochrome b6-f complex, which mediates
    electron transfer between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I
    (PSI), cyclic electron flow around PSI, and state transitions (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Plastoquinol-1 + 2 oxidized plastocyanin =
    plastoquinone + 2 reduced plastocyanin.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The 4 large subunits of the cytochrome b6-f complex are
    cytochrome b6, subunit IV (17 kDa polypeptide, petD), cytochrome f
    and the Rieske protein, while the 4 small subunits are petG, petL,
    petM and petN. The complex functions as a dimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cellular thylakoid membrane; single-pass
    membrane protein (By similarity). Note=The transmembrane helix
    obliquely spans the membrane in one monomer, and its extrinsic C-
    terminal domain is part of the other monomer (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The Rieske iron-sulfur protein is a high potential
    2Fe-2S protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Rieske domain.
