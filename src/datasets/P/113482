NADH-quinone oxidoreductase subunit 13 (EC 1.6.99.5) (NADH
dehydrogenase I chain 13) (NDH-1 subunit 13).
"The proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-1) of
thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB-8. Complete DNA
sequence of the gene cluster and thermostable properties of the
expressed NQO2 subunit.";
"Complete genome sequence of Thermus thermophilus HB8.";
-!- FUNCTION: NDH-1 shuttles electrons from NADH, via FMN and iron-
    sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the respiratory chain. The
    immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is
    menaquinone. Couples the redox reaction to proton translocation
    (for every two electrons transferred, four hydrogen ions are
    translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus conserves
    the redox energy in a proton gradient required for the synthesis
    of ATP.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + quinone = NAD(+) + quinol.
-!- SUBUNIT: NDH-1 is composed of 15 different subunits, nqo1 to
    nqo15. The complex has a L-shaped structure, with the hydrophobic
    arm (subunits nqo7, nqo8 and nqo10 to nqo14) embedded in the
    membrane and the hydrophilic peripheral arm (subunits nqo1 to
    nqo6, nqo9 and nqo15) protruding into the bacterial cytoplasm. The
    hydrophilic domain contains all the redox centers.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I subunit 4 family.
