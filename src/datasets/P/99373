Mechanosensory abnormality protein 6.
"The mechanosensory protein MEC-6 is a subunit of the C. elegans
touch-cell degenerin channel.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable touch-cell sodium channel subunit. May be
    needed for mechanosensory transduction (touch sensitivity).
    Interacts with degenerin channel proteins and stabilizes the
    channel. Non-voltage-gated amiloride-sensitive cation channel
    permeable for sodium, potassium, lithium and N-methylglucamine.
-!- SUBUNIT: The channel is probably composed of at least the mec-2,
    mec-4, mec-6 and mec-10 subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in muscle cells, many neurons,
    including the six touch receptor neurons, and excretory canal.
    Coexpressed with mec-4 in touch-cell axons.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The U3 mutation does not affect the expression
    levels, but completely blocks mec-4(d)-induced degenerations, and
    abolishes the punctate expression of mec-4 in vivo.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the paraoxonase family.
