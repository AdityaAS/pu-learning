Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1-beta (EC 1.9.3.1) (Cytochrome c oxidase
polypeptide I-beta) (Cytochrome aa3 subunit 1-beta).
"Are there isoenzymes of cytochrome c oxidase in Paracoccus
denitrificans?";
"Structure at 2.8-A resolution of cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus
denitrificans.";
"Structure at 2.7-A resolution of the Paracoccus denitrificans two-
subunit cytochrome c oxidase complexed with an antibody FV fragment.";
"Evidence for a copper-coordinated histidine-tyrosine cross-link in
the active site of cytochrome oxidase.";
"Cytochrome c oxidase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Subunit I and II form the functional core of the enzyme
    complex. Electrons originating in cytochrome c are transferred via
    heme a and Cu(A) to the binuclear center formed by heme a3 and
    Cu(B). This cytochrome c oxidase shows proton pump activity across
    the membrane in addition to the electron transfer.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 copper B ion per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 heme groups per subunit.
-!- PATHWAY: Respiratory chain; terminal step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- PTM: His-276 and Tyr-280 are involved in the formation of a
    copper-coordinated covalent cross-link at the active site of the
    catalytic subunit I.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the heme-copper respiratory oxidase family.
