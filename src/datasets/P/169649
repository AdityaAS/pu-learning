AC   Q9JMD7;
High-affinity choline transporter 1 (Solute carrier family 5 member 7)
(Hemicholinium-3-sensitive choline transporter) (CHT).
"Identification and characterization of the high-affinity choline
transporter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Imports choline from the extracellular space to the
    neuron with high affinity. Rate-limiting step in acetylcholine
    synthesis. Sodium ion and chloride ion dependent.
-!- PATHWAY: Acetylcholine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By
    similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in basal forebrain, brain stem,
    spinal chord, and striatum. Specific for cholinergic neurons.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Specifically inhibited by nanomolar concentrations
    of hemicholinium 3.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:solute symporter (SSF)
    (TC 2.A.21) family.
