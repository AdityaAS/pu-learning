-!- FUNCTION: Terminal reductase during anaerobic growth on various
    sulfoxide and N-oxide compounds. DmsC anchors the dmsAB dimer to
    the membrane and stabilizes it.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic heterodimer
    (DmsAB) and a membrane anchor protein (DmsC).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: To E.coli ynfH.
