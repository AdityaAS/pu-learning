-!- FUNCTION: Part of a membrane-spanning permease system necessary
    for the transport of pigment precursors into pigment cells
    responsible for eye color. White dimerize with brown for the
    transport of guanine. Scarlet and white complex transports a
    metabolic intermediate (such as 3-hydroxy kynurenine) from the
    cytoplasm into the pigment granules.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of white with either brown or scarlet.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q9V6R2:CG13332; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-93778, EBI-185611;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Note=Pigment granules within pigment cells and retinula cells of
    the compound eye (when complexed with st).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
