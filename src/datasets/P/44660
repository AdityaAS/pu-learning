AC   P26903;
Dipeptide transport system permease protein dppB.
"A Bacillus subtilis dipeptide transport system expressed early during
sporulation.";
"Sequence of the Bacillus subtilis genome between xlyA and ykoR.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for dipeptides; probably responsible for the translocation of the
    substrate across the membrane. Is expressed to facilitate
    adaptation to nutrient deficiency conditions.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed early during sporulation.
-!- INDUCTION: Nutrient deficiency conditions, which also induce
    sporulation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. OppBC subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
