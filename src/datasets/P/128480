NAD(P) transhydrogenase subunit beta (EC 1.6.1.2) (Pyridine nucleotide
transhydrogenase subunit beta) (Nicotinamide nucleotide
transhydrogenase subunit beta) (Proton-translocating transhydrogenase
NADP(H)-binding component) (dIII).
"Cloning and sequencing of the genes for the proton-translocating
nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum
and the implications for the domain structure of the enzyme.";
"Complete sequence of the chromosome of Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC
11170.";
-!- FUNCTION: The transhydrogenation between NADH and NADP is coupled
    to respiration and ATP hydrolysis and functions as a proton pump
    across the membrane (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADPH + NAD(+) = NADP(+) + NADH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex of an alpha and a beta chain; in Rhodospirillum,
    the alpha chain seems to be made of two subunits (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PNT beta subunit family.
