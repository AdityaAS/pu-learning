AC   P42200;
Probable amino-acid ABC transporter permease protein yckJ.
"An operon encoding a novel ABC-type transport system in Bacillus
subtilis.";
"The 25 degrees-36 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome:
determination of the sequence of a 146 kb segment and identification
of 113 genes.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably part of a binding-protein-dependent transport
    system for an amino acid. Probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. HisMQ subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
