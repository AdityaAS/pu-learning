AC   P40290;
Probable ATP synthase yscN (EC 3.6.3.14) (YOPS secretion ATPase).
"YscN, the putative energizer of the Yersinia Yop secretion
machinery.";
"The lcrE gene is part of an operon in the lcr region of Yersinia
enterocolitica O:3.";
-!- FUNCTION: Is a component of the YOP secretion machinery using ATP,
    and it is either the energizer of this machinery, or part of it.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Note=But connected to the inner
    membrane possibly through LcrD (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
