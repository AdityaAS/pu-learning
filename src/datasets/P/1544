-!- FUNCTION: Essential for aminobenzoyl-glutamate utilization. May
    transport aminobenzoyl-glutamate into the cell. Seems also to
    increase the sensitivity to low levels of aminobenzoyl-glutamate.
    Sufficient to confer aminobenzoyl-glutamate utilization phenotype.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: It is suggested that in wild-type strain abgT would
    normally be cryptic or not expressed under conditions of growth on
    minimal medium. Altering the expression of abgT from its wild-type
    context appears to be the mechanism for obtaining the growth
    phenotype.
