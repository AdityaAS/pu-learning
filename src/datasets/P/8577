-!- FUNCTION: Water channel required to facilitate the transport of
    water across membranes. Involved in freeze tolerance,
    osmotolerance and cell flocculation in liquid cultures. Is
    nonfunctional in most laboratory strains.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Cell membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: During exponential phase in rich medium and repressed
    in minimum medium, hyper-osmolar medium or in sporulating
    conditions.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- POLYMORPHISM: In strain S288c / AB972, a natural 11 bp deletion in
    position 109 changes the frame and leads to a premature stop
    codon. This leads to a non-functional protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
