AC   P46720;
Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1A1 (Solute
carrier family 21 member 1) (Sodium-independent organic anion
transporter 1) (Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1).
"Expression cloning of a rat liver Na(+)-independent organic anion
transporter.";
"Interaction with PDZK1 is required for expression of organic anion
transporting protein 1A1 on the hepatocyte surface.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the Na(+)-independent transport of organic
    anions such as bromosulfobromophthalein (BSP) and conjugated
    (taurocholate) and unconjugated (cholate) bile acids.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds to PDZK1. Interaction with PDZK1 is required for
    expression on hepatocyte surface.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in liver and kidney, and at
    lower levels in brain, lung, skeletal muscle and proximal colon.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the organo anion transporter (TC 2.A.60)
    family.
