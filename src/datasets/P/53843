AC   Q7MVL1;
Ferrous iron transport protein B homolog.
"Complete genome sequence of the oral pathogenic bacterium
Porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83.";
"A novel Porphyromonas gingivalis FeoB plays a role in manganese
accumulation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Not involved in Fe(2+) uptake but is involved in
    manganese uptake. Could be GTP-driven.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Insertional inactivation of feoB2 causes a 3-fold
    decrease in cellular manganese level.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the feoB (TC 9.A.8) family.
