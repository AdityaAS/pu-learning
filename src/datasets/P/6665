Ammonium transporter 2 (AtAMT2).
"Characterization of Arabidopsis AtAMT2, a novel ammonium transporter
in plants.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 2 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transports ammonium, probably in an energy-dependent
    manner. Does not transport methylammonium.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Higher expression in shoots than roots.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ammonium transporter (TC 2.A.49)
    family.
