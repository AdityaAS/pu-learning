Mitochondrial ornithine transporter 2 (Solute carrier family 25 member
2).
"Comparative DNA sequence analysis of mouse and human protocadherin
gene clusters.";
"Cloning and characterization of human ORNT2: a second mitochondrial
ornithine transporter that can rescue a defective ORNT1 in patients
with the hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome,
a urea cycle disorder.";
-!- FUNCTION: Ornithine transport across inner mitochondrial membrane,
    from the cytoplasm to the matrix.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in liver, kidney, pancreas, and
    cultured fibroblats.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: Variant Cys-159 has a reduced ornithine transport
    activity, while variant Gly-181 has an increased activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
