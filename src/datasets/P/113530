-!- FUNCTION: NQR complex catalyzes the reduction of ubiquinone-1 to
    ubiquinol by two successive reactions, coupled with the transport
    of Na(+) ions from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. NqrA to nqrE
    are probably involved in the second step, the conversion of
    ubisemiquinone to ubiquinol.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone + Na(+)(In) = NAD(+) +
    ubiquinol + Na(+)(Out).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: This reaction is tightly coupled to the Na(+)
    pumping activity and specifically requires Na(+) for activity.
    Inhibited by korormicin and 2-N-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide
    (HQNO).
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of six subunits; nqrA, nqrB, nqrC, nqrD, nqrE
    and nqrF.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nqrA family.
