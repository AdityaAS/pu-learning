AC   P24011; O34404;
Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 precursor (EC 1.9.3.1) (Cytochrome c
oxidase polypeptide II) (Cytochrome aa3 subunit 2) (Caa-3605 subunit
2) (Oxidase aa(3) subunit 2).
"The Bacillus subtilis cytochrome-c oxidase. Variations on a conserved
protein theme.";
"Bacillus subtilis chromosomal region downstream nprE.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Subunits I and II form the functional core of the enzyme
    complex. Electrons originating in cytochrome c are transferred via
    heme a and Cu(A) to the binuclear center formed by heme a3 and
    Cu(B).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Copper A.
-!- COFACTOR: Heme group.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 cytochrome c domain.
