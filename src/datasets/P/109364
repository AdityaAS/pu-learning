"The narK gene product participates in nitrate transport induced in
Escherichia coli nitrate-respiring cells.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"The narX and narL genes encoding the nitrate-sensing regulators of
Escherichia coli are homologous to a family of prokaryotic two-
component regulatory genes.";
"Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in excretion of nitrite produced by the
    dissimilatory reduction of nitrate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrate under anaerobic conditions.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Since the transport is controlled by oxygen, five
    Cys residues in narK may play an important role in sensing redox
    potential to regulate the facilitator.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the narK/nasA transporter family.
