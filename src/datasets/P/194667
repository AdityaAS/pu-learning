-!- FUNCTION: Contributes to the development of lesions and deposition
    of fibrin in the avian air sacs. It can act both as an adhesin and
    as a serine protease. Agglutinates erythrocytes while in contact
    with the extracellular surface of the bacterial cells. Can adhere
    to purified hemoglobin and bind with great efficiency to
    extracellular matrix proteins. Cleaves casein and exhibits
    mucinolytic activity.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Temperature dependence:
      Optimum temperature is 26 degrees Celsius for hemagglutination
      activity;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- DOMAIN: Adhesive and proteolytic functions of tsh lie in different
    domains of the protein.
-!- PTM: The C-terminus is blocked (Probable).
-!- PTM: Cleaved to release the mature protein from the outer
    membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 autotransporter (TC 1.B.12) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase S6 domain.
