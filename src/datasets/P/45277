AC   P00587;
Diphtheria toxin precursor (DT) (NAD(+)--diphthamide ADP-
ribosyltransferase) (EC 2.4.2.36) [Contains: Diphtheria toxin fragment
A; Diphtheria toxin fragment B].
"The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for diphtheria
toxin in the corynephage omega (tox+) genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Diphtheria toxin, produced by a phage infecting
    corynebacterium diphtheriae, is a proenzyme that, after
    activation, catalyzes the covalent attachment of the ADP ribose
    moiety of NAD to elongation factor 2. Fragment A is responsible
    for enzymatic ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2, while
    fragment B is responsible for binding of toxin to cell receptors
    and entry of fragment A.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NAD(+) + peptide diphthamide = nicotinamide +
    peptide N-(ADP-D-ribosyl)diphthamide.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
