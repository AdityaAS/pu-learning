AC   P54708;
Potassium-transporting ATPase alpha chain 2 (EC 3.6.3.10) (Proton
pump) (Non-gastric H(+)/K(+) ATPase subunit alpha).
"Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding the putative distal
colon H+,K(+)-ATPase. Similarity of deduced amino acid sequence to
gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase and Na+,K(+)-ATPase and mRNA expression in
distal colon, kidney, and uterus.";
"A novel N-terminal splice variant of the rat H+-K+-ATPase alpha2
subunit. Cloning, functional expression, and renal adaptive response
to chronic hypokalemia.";
"Ouabain-sensitive H,K-ATPase: tissue-specific expression of the
mammalian genes encoding the catalytic alpha subunit.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the
    exchange of H(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane.
    Responsible for potassium absorption in various tissues.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) + K(+)(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + H(+)(Out) + K(+)(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of two subunits: alpha (catalytic) and beta.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Long; Synonyms=2a;
      IsoId=P54708-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Short; Synonyms=2b;
      IsoId=P54708-2; Sequence=VSP_000414;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed at high levels in distal colon,
    coagulating and preputial glands; at much lower levels in proximal
    colon, kidney, uterus, brain, placenta and lung; and at trace
    levels in heart and forestomach.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IIC subfamily.
