systematic review.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the voltage-dependent potassium ion
    permeability of excitable membranes. Assuming opened or closed
    conformations in response to the voltage difference across the
    membrane, the protein forms a potassium-selective channel through
    which potassium ions may pass in accordance with their
    electrochemical gradient. May play a role in the nervous system
    and in the regulation of beating frequency in pacemaker cells.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer of potassium channel proteins (By
    similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q9VYA8:CG11176; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-145706, EBI-95641;
    Q9VBL2:CG5890; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-145706, EBI-105608;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=P17971-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=P17971-2; Sequence=Not described;
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminus may be important in determining the rate of
    inactivation of the channel while the tail may play a role in
    modulation of channel activity and/or targeting of the channel to
    specific subcellular compartments.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The segment S4 is probably the voltage-sensor and
    is characterized by a series of positively charged amino acids at
    every third position.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family. Shal
    subfamily.
