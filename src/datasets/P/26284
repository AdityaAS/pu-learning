-!- FUNCTION: Not yet known. Postulated to participate in iron
    transport. Outer membrane receptor for colicins IA and IB.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- INDUCTION: By iron and by a cAMP/cAMP receptor protein complex.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tonB-dependent receptor family.
