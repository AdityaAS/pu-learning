-!- FUNCTION: Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased
    drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + xenobiotic(In) = ADP + phosphate
    + xenobiotic(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in liver, kidney, small intestine
    and brain.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: Genetic variation in ABCB1 may play a role in
    patients who do not respond to drug treatment.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transmembrane type-1 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.5 (AAB69423) sequence differs from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
