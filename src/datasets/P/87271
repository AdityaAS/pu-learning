AC   Q934G3;
Oligogalacturonate-specific porin kdgM precursor.
"The oligogalacturonate-specific porin KdgM of Erwinia chrysanthemi
belongs to a new porin family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Porin specific for oligogalacturonides. Also required
    for full virulence.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by pectin or pectin derivatives. Controlled by
    kdgR, exuR, pecS and catabolite repression via CRP.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the oligogalacturonate-specific porin kdgM
    (TC 1.B.35) family.
