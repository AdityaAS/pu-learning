-!- FUNCTION: Transport system that facilitates potassium-efflux,
    possibly by potassium-proton antiport.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: KefC system is apparently under negative feedback
    regulation by glutathione and removal of glutathione leads to
    partial activation of the system. Complete activation requires the
    formation of glutathione metabolites that carry a hydrophobic
    substituent on the S-atom.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the monovalent cation:proton antiporter 2
    (CPA2) transporter (TC 2.A.37) family. KefC subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RCK N-terminal domain.
