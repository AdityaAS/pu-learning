transporter 1) (CNT 1) (hCNT1).

Na+-nucleoside cotransporter (hCNT1).";

sodium-dependent, pyrimidine-selective nucleoside transporter
(CNT1).";

-!- FUNCTION: Sodium-dependent and pyrimidine-selective. Exhibits the
    transport characteristics of the nucleoside transport system cit
    or N2 subtype (N2/cit) (selective for pyrimidine nucleosides and
    adenosine). It also transports the antiviral pyrimidine nucleoside
    analogs 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine
    (ddC). It may be involved in the intestinal absorption and renal
    handling of pyrimidine nucleoside analogs used to treat acquired
    immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It has the following selective
    inhibition: adenosine, thymidine, cytidine, uridine >> guanosine,
    inosine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in kidney.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: Three isoforms; A, B, and C (shown here); are
    expressed in the kidney. All isoforms have similar nucleoside
    transport activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC28A transporter family.
