AC   Q14957;
Glutamate [NMDA] receptor subunit epsilon 3 precursor (N-methyl D-
aspartate receptor subtype 2C) (NR2C) (NMDAR2C).
"Cloning of the cDNA for the human NMDA receptor NR2C subunit and its
expression in the central nervous system and periphery.";
-!- FUNCTION: NMDA receptor subtype of glutamate-gated ion channels
    with high calcium permeability and voltage-dependent sensitivity
    to magnesium. Mediated by glycine.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PDZ domains of INADL and DLG4 (By
    similarity). Forms heteromeric channel of a zeta subunit (GRIN1),
    a epsilon subunit (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C or GRIN2D) and a third
    subunit (GRIN3A or GRIN3B).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Mainly in brain with predominant expression is
    in the cerebellum, also present in the hippocampus, amygdala,
    caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, subthalamic nuclei and thalamus.
    Detected in the heart, skeletal muscle and pancreas.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glutamate-gated ion channel (TC 1.A.10)
    family.
