-!- FUNCTION: The reaction center is a membrane-bound complex that
    mediates the initial photochemical event in the electron transfer
    process of photosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Reaction center is composed of four bacteriochlorophylls,
    two bacteriopheophytins, two ubiquinones, one iron, and three
    highly hydrophobic polypeptide chains (designated L, M, and H).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the reaction center pufL/M/psbA/D family.
