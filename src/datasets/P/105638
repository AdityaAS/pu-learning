AC   P42364;
Metal ABC transporter substrate-binding lipoprotein precursor
(Coaggregation-mediating adhesin).
"Nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus gordonii PK488 coaggregation
adhesin gene, scaA, and ATP-binding cassette.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of an ATP-driven transport system for a metal;
    probably for manganese. Also act as an adhesin which is involved
    on adherence to extracellular matrix. It is an important factor in
    pathogenesis and infection.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 9
    family. Lipoprotein receptor antigen (Lrai) subfamily.
