AC   P12681;
Phosphoglycerate transporter protein.
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Nucleotide sequence and transcription start point of the
phosphoglycerate transporter gene of Salmonella typhimurium.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoglycerate transporter protein is a part of
    the PGT transport system. It is the membrane bound transporter for
    phosphoglycerate into salmonella.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By extracellular phosphoglycerate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. SLC37A
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (AAA27186) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 134, 146 and 407.
Complete proteome; Inner membrane; Membrane; Transmembrane; Transport.
