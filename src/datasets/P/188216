-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    tbpA-thiPQ for thiamine and TPP. Probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. CysTW subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transmembrane type-1 domains.
