Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2 (Type 2 inositol 1,4,5-
trisphosphate receptor) (Type 2 InsP3 receptor) (IP3 receptor isoform
2) (InsP3R2).
"Structure of a novel InsP3 receptor.";
"New rat IP3R isoform 2 sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a second
    messenger that mediates the release of intracellular calcium.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The receptor contains a calcium channel in its C-terminal
    extremity. Its large N-terminal cytoplasmic region has the ligand-
    binding site in the N-terminus and modulatory sites in the middle
    portion immediately upstream of the channel region.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the InsP3 receptor family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 MIR domains.
