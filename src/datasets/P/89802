AC   P63184; P30016; P76748;
Low affinity potassium transport system protein kup (Kup system
potassium uptake protein).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the low-affinity transport of potassium
    into the cell, with the probable concomitant uptake of protons
    (symport system) (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HAK/KUP transporter (TC 2.A.72) family.
