-!- FUNCTION: Involved in transporting tryptophan across the
    cytoplasmic membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By phenylalanine under the control of regulatory
    protein tyrR.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid/polyamine transporter 2
    family. Mtr/tnaB/tyrP permease subfamily.
