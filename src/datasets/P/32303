-!- FUNCTION: Promotes colloidosmotic lysis by binding to the midgut
    epithelial cells of Coleoptera.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: The crystal protein is produced during
    sporulation and is accumulated both as an inclusion and as part of
    the spore coat.
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Introduced by genetic manipulation and expressed in
    insect-resistant potato by Monsanto.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Toxic segment of the protein is located in the N-
    terminus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the delta endotoxin family.
3D-structure; Genetically modified food; Sporulation; Toxin.
