"Molecular characterization and regulation of an operon encoding a
system for transport of arginine and ornithine and the ArgR regulatory
protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.";
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
"Cloning and characterization of argR, a gene that participates in
regulation of arginine biosynthesis and catabolism in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa PAO1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the arginine-inducible binding-protein-dependent
    transport system for arginine and ornithine. Probably responsible
    for energy coupling to the transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
