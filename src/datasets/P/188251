[Contains: Purothionin A-1; Acidic protein].
"Complete primary structures of two subunits of purothionin A, a
lethal protein for brewer's yeast from wheat flour.";
"The amino acid sequence of purothionin A, a lethal toxic protein to
brewer's yeast from wheat.";
"The amino acid sequence of wheat beta-purothionin.";
"Refinement of purothionins reveals solute particles important for
lattice formation and toxicity. Part 2: structure of beta-purothionin
at 1.7-A resolution.";
-!- FUNCTION: Thionins are small plant proteins which are toxic to
    animal cells. They seem to exert their toxic effect at the level
    of the cell membrane. Their precise function is not known.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the plant thionin (TC 1.C.44) family.
