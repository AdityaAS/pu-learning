-!- FUNCTION: Subunit of the integral membrane V0 complex of vacuolar
    ATPase essential for assembly and catalytic activity. Is present
    only in vacuolar V-ATPase complexes. Enzymes containing this
    subunit have a 4-fold higher ratio of proton transport to ATP
    hydrolysis than complexes containing the Golgi/endosomal isoform
    and undergo reversible dissociation of V1 and V0 in response to
    glucose depletion. V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying a
    variety of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (components A to H) attached to an
    integral membrane V0 proton pore complex (components: a, c, c',
    c'', d and e).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 55714 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase 116 kDa subunit family.
