coli: a gene cluster involved in the utilization of taurine as a
sulfur source.";

-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex tauABC involved in
    taurine import. Responsible for energy coupling to the transport
    system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + taurine(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    taurine(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (tauB), two transmembrane proteins (tauC) and a solute-binding
    protein (tauA) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: Regulated by cysB in response to sulfate starvation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Taurine
    importer (TC 3.A.1.17.1) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
