AC   Q9ZHD2;
Probable outer membrane lipoprotein silC precursor.
"Molecular basis for resistance to silver cations in Salmonella.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the sil cation-efflux system that confers
    resistance to silver. May be part of a three-component
    cation/proton antiporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; lipid-anchor
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the outer membrane factor (OMF) (TC 1.B.17)
    family.
