AC   Q9H2S1;
Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel protein 2 (SK2).
"Ca2+-activated K+ channels in human leukemic Jurkat T cells.
Molecular cloning, biochemical and functional characterization.";
"Characterization of calcium-activated potassium channels in human
myometrium.";
-!- FUNCTION: Forms a voltage-independent potassium channel activated
    by intracellular calcium. Activation is followed by membrane
    hyperpolarization. Thought to regulate neuronal excitability by
    contributing to the slow component of synaptic
    afterhyperpolarization. The channel is blocked by apamin.
-!- SUBUNIT: Hetero-oligomer. The complex is composed of 4 channel
    subunits each of which binds to a calmodulin subunit which
    regulates the channel activity through calcium-binding (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel KCNN family.
