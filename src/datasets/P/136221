Probable peptide transporter ptr2 (Peptide permease ptr2).
"An Arabidopsis peptide transporter is a member of a new class of
membrane transport proteins.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"Large-scale screening of intracellular protein localization in living
fission yeast cells by the use of a GFP-fusion genomic DNA library.";
-!- FUNCTION: Uptake of small peptides (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PTR2/POT transporter (TC 2.A.17)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) reported to be isolated from an
    A.thaliana cv. Landsberg erecta cDNA library.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to frameshifts
    in positions 296 and 341.
