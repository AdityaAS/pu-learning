Porin B precursor (Outer membrane protein D1) (Glucose porin).
"Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa
glucose-selective OprB porin gene and distribution of OprB within the
family Pseudomonadaceae.";

opportunistic pathogen.";
"Specificity of the glucose channel formed by protein D1 of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.";
"Biophysical characterization of OprB, a glucose-inducible porin of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.";
"The OprB porin plays a central role in carbohydrate uptake in
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Substrate-selective channel for a variety of different
    sugars. Could potentially facilitate the diffusion of diverse
    compounds, dependent on the presence of a hydroxyl group, but is
    presumably restricted to carbohydrates. Involved in the transport
    of glucose, mannitol, fructose and glycerol (sugars able to
    support the growth of P.aeruginosa). Facilitates glucose diffusion
    across the outer membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By glucose.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the oprB family.
