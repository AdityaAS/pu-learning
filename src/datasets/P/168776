-!- FUNCTION: Mediates both influx and efflux of nucleosides across
    the membrane (equilibrative transporter). It is sensitive (ES) to
    low concentrations of the inhibitor nitrobenzylmercaptopurine
    riboside (NBMPR) and is sodium-independent. It has a higher
    affinity for adenosine. Inhibited by dipyridamole and dilazep
    (anticancer chemotherapeutics drugs).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P49842:STK19; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-347907, EBI-347581;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in heart, brain, mammary gland,
    erythrocytes and placenta, and also in fetal liver and spleen.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC29A transporter family.
