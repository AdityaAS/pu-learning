-!- FUNCTION: Antimicrobial protein that kills intracellular
    pathogens. Active against a broad range of microbes, including
    Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and parasites.
    Kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein. Note=Located in the
    cytotoxic granules of T-cells, which are released upon antigen
    stimulation.
