-!- FUNCTION: Light-driven proton pump that generates photothrophic
    energy.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: It presents a fast proton release and an
    alkaliphilic photocycle, consistent with its marine origin and the
    near-surface environment where this bacterium was collected.
    Transport occurs only at pHs above 7 and is unidirectional.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Mutagenesis experiments that removed all the Cys
    residues of GPR show that at least one of the Cys residues in the
    protein is probably modified post-translationally.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the archaeal/bacterial/fungal opsin family.
