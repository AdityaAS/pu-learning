Pesticidal crystal protein cry1Aa (Insecticidal delta-endotoxin
CryIA(a)) (Crystaline entomocidal protoxin) (133 kDa crystal protein).
"Nucleotide sequence of a gene cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis
subspecies entomocidus coding for an insecticidal protein toxic for
Bombyx mori.";
-!- FUNCTION: Promotes colloidosmotic lysis by binding to the midgut
    epithelial cells of many lepidopteran larvae.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: The crystal protein is produced during
    sporulation and is accumulated both as an inclusion and as part of
    the spore coat.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Toxic segment of the protein is located in the N-
    terminus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the delta endotoxin family.
Sporulation; Toxin.
