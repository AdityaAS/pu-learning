-!- FUNCTION: This protein is a component of the leucine-specific
    transport system, which is one of the two periplasmic binding
    protein-dependent transport systems of the high-affinity transport
    of the branched-chain amino acids in E.coli.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the leucine-binding protein family.
