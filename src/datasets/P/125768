Probable K(+)/H(+) antiporter subunit A/B (pH adaptation potassium
efflux system protein A/B) (Pha system subunit A/B).
"The pha gene cluster of Rhizobium meliloti involved in pH adaptation
and symbiosis encodes a novel type of K+ efflux system.";
"Analysis of the chromosome sequence of the legume symbiont
Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021.";
"Sinorhizobium meliloti phaA gene segment.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a K(+) efflux system which is required for the
    adaptation of R.meliloti to alkaline pH as well as for the
    infection process during symbiotic nodule development.
-!- SUBUNIT: May form a hetero-oligomeric complex that consists of six
    subunits: phaAB, phaC, phaD, phaE, phaF and phaG.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the CPA3
    antiporters (TC 2.A.63) subunit A family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the CPA3
    antiporters (TC 2.A.63) subunit B family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 718. The frameshift produces two separate
    ORFs named phaA and phaB.
