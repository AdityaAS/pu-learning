AC   O81123;
Zinc transporter 1 precursor (ZRT/IRT-like protein 1).
"Identification of a family of zinc transporter genes from Arabidopsis
that respond to zinc deficiency.";
"Structural analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 3. I. Sequence
features of the regions of 4,504,864 bp covered by sixty P1 and TAC
clones.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates zinc uptake from the rhizosphere. May also
    transport copper and cadmium ions.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed predominantly in the roots of zinc-
    deficient plants.
-!- INDUCTION: By zinc starvation.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Zinc uptake is inhibited by copper and cadmium
    ions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ZIP transporter (TC 2.A.5) family.
