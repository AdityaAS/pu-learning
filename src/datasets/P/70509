AC   P45387;
Adhesion and penetration protein precursor (EC 3.4.21.-).
"A Haemophilus influenzae IgA protease-like protein promotes intimate
interaction with human epithelial cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable protease; promotes adherence and invasion by
    directly binding to a host cell structure.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The signal peptide guides the precursor to the periplasmic
    space, and the C-terminal helper domain associates with the outer
    membrane to form a pore for excretion of the protease domain. The
    helper domain is then released by autoproteolysis (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 autotransporter (TC 1.B.12) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase S6 domain.
