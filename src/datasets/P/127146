AC   P25794; Q41006;
Probable aquaporin PIP-type 7a (Turgor-responsive protein 7a) (Turgor-
responsive protein 31).
"Turgor-responsive gene transcription and RNA levels increase rapidly
when pea shoots are wilted. Sequence and expression of three inducible
genes.";
"Tissue-specific expression of a plant turgor-responsive gene with
amino acid sequence homology to transport-facilitating proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Aquaporins facilitate the transport of water and small
    neutral solutes across cell membranes (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By water stress, heat shock and to a small extent by
    abscisic acid (ABA). Induced within 30 min after the loss of leaf
    turgor.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family. PIP
    subfamily.
