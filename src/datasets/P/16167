network of the bacitracin stimulon.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex bceAB
    (TC 3.A.1.123.5) involved in bacitracin export. Responsible for
    energy coupling to the transport system.
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (bceA) and two transmembrane proteins (bceB) (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: Expression is induced by bacitracin, via the two-
    component regulatory system bceS/bceR.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
