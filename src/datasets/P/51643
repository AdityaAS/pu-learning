AC   P33699;
Succinoglycan biosynthesis transport protein exoT.
"Family of glycosyl transferases needed for the synthesis of
succinoglycan by Rhizobium meliloti.";
"Genes needed for the modification, polymerization, export, and
processing of succinoglycan by Rhizobium meliloti: a model for
succinoglycan biosynthesis.";
"Analysis of the Rhizobium meliloti genes exoU, exoV, exoW, exoT, and
exoI involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and nodule invasion:
exoU and exoW probably encode glucosyltransferases.";
