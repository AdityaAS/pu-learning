Calcium-gated potassium channel mthK.
"Complete genome sequence of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum
deltaH: functional analysis and comparative genomics.";
"Crystal structure and mechanism of a calcium-gated potassium
channel.";
-!- FUNCTION: Calcium-gated potassium channel.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative initiation; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1; Synonyms=Calcium-gated potassium channel;
      IsoId=O27564-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Soluble; Synonyms=RCK domain;
      IsoId=O27564-2; Sequence=VSP_018901;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- DOMAIN: The channel is composed of 4 repeated units, each
    containing a transmembrane pore part and a gating ring part. The
    gating ring is composed of eight identical RCK (Regulators of K
    conductance) domains, in an alternating arrangement of one domain
    from each of the four subunits and four from the intracellular
    solution. Two protein interfaces between dimers of RCK domains
    from the pore-forming subunit and from the intracellular solution
    hold the ring together. One is called the fixed interface and the
    other the flexible interface. The flexible interface forms a cleft
    where calcium binds. Upon calcium binding the gating ring
    undergoes a conformational change that enables it to pull open the
    inner helices of the pore, allowing ion conduction.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: It is not known whether calcium is the
    physiological ligand.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibited by charybdotoxin (CTX), a protein from
    scorpion venom.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RCK C-terminal domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RCK N-terminal domain.
