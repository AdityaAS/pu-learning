Xylose import ATP-binding protein xylG (EC 3.6.3.17).
"Analysis of the Escherichia coli genome. V. DNA sequence of the
region from 76.0 to 81.5 minutes.";

"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Utilization of D-ribose through D-xylose transporter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex xylFGH involved in
    xylose import. Responsible for energy coupling to the transport
    system (Probable). The xylFGH system can also transport ribose in
    absence of xylose.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + monosaccharide(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + monosaccharide(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (xylG), two transmembrane proteins (xylH) and a solute-binding
    protein (xylF) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Xylose importer
    (TC 3.A.1.2.4) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
