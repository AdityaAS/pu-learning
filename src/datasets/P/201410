-!- FUNCTION: Non-catalytic subunit of the peripheral V1 complex of
    vacuolar ATPase. V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying a variety
    of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. It is an
    electrogenic proton pump that generates a proton motive force of
    180 mv, inside positive and acidic, in the vacuolar membrane
    vesicles.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (components A to H) attached to an
    integral membrane V0 proton pore complex (components: a, c, c',
    c'', d and e). Interacts with RAV1 and RAV2 components of the RAVE
    complex, which are essential for the stability and assembly of V-
    ATPase.

    Q03956:RAV2; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-20254, EBI-30629;
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 131000 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.5 sequence was incorrectly thought to originate from
    bovine.
