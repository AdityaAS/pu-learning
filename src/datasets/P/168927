Sodium- and chloride-dependent neutral and basic amino acid
transporter B(0+) (Amino acid transporter ATB0+) (Solute carrier
family 6 member 14).
"Cloning and functional expression of a human Na(+) and Cl(-)-
dependent neutral and cationic amino acid transporter B(0+).";
"The DNA sequence of the human X chromosome.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the uptake of a broad range of neutral and
    cationic amino acids (with the exception of proline) in a
    (Na+/Cl-)-dependent manner.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Levels are highest in adult and fetal lung, in
    trachea and salivary gland. Lower levels detected in mammary
    gland, stomach and pituitary gland, and very low levels in colon,
    uterus, prostate and testis.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Transport inhibited by BCH (2-aminobicyclo-[2.2.1]-
    heptane-2-carboxylic acid).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
