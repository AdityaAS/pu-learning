AC   Q63632; P70632;
Solute carrier family 12 member 4 (Electroneutral potassium-chloride
cotransporter 1) (Erythroid K-Cl cotransporter 1) (rKCC1) (Furosemide-
sensitive K-Cl cotransporter).
"Molecular cloning and functional expression of the K-Cl cotransporter
from rabbit, rat, and human. A new member of the cation-chloride
cotransporter family.";
"Mouse K-Cl cotransporter KCC1: cloning, mapping, pathological
expression, and functional regulation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates electroneutral potassium-chloride cotransport
    when activated by cell swelling. May contribute to cell volume
    homeostasis in single cells. May be involved in the regulation of
    basolateral Cl(-) exit in NaCl absorbing epithelia (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous.
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC12A transporter family.
