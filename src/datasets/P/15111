AC   P11718;
Probable proton ATPase 1A (EC 3.6.3.6) (LDH1A protein).
"Structure and expression of a tandem gene pair in Leishmania donovani
that encodes a protein structurally homologous to eucaryotic cation-
transporting ATPases.";
"A tandem pair of Leishmania donovani cation transporting ATPase genes
encode isoforms that are differentially expressed.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: More abundant in promastigotes than
    amastigotes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IIIA subfamily.
