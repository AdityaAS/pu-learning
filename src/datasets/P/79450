Biofilm PIA synthesis N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase icaA
(EC 2.4.-.-) (Intercellular adhesion protein A).
"Molecular basis of intercellular adhesion in the biofilm-forming
Staphylococcus epidermidis.";
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
"Characterization of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity
involved in the biosynthesis of the Staphylococcus epidermidis
polysaccharide intercellular adhesin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Along with icaD, exhibits a N-
    acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity. IcaA represents the
    catalytic enzyme that requires icaD for full activity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 2 family.
