AC   P48836;
Vacuolar ATP synthase subunit G (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-ATPase G subunit)
(Vacuolar proton pump G subunit) (V-ATPase 13 kDa subunit).
"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae VMA10 is an intron-containing gene
encoding a novel 13-kDa subunit of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase.";
"Complete nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
VIII.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Non-integral membrane component of the membrane integral
    V0 complex of vacuolar ATPase. V-ATPase is responsible for
    acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic
    cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (components A to H) attached to an
    integral membrane V0 proton pore complex (components: a, c, c',
    c'', d and e).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 2280 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase G subunit family.
