-!- FUNCTION: Probably acts as an electrical shunt for an outwardly-
    directed proton pump that is linked to amino acid decarboxylation,
    as part of the extreme acid resistance (XAR) response.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: By acid-shock conditions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chloride channel (TC 1.A.11) family.
    ClcA subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally thought to be a voltage-gated ClC-type
    chloride channel.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 11.
