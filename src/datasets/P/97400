Mastoparan-X (MP-X).
"A new mast cell degranulating peptide homologous to mastoparan in the
venom of Japanese hornet (Vespa xanthoptera).";
"Membrane-bound conformation of mastoparan-X, a G-protein-activating
peptide.";
"G protein-bound conformation of mastoparan-X: heteronuclear
multidimensional transferred nuclear overhauser effect analysis of
peptide uniformly enriched with 13C and 15N.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mast cell degranulating peptide. Activates G proteins
    that couple to phospholipase C.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MCD family. Mastoparan subfamily.
