-!- FUNCTION: Kills the larvae of dipteran insects by making pores in
    the epithelial cell membrane of the insect midgut. Acts on
    mosquitos and black flies.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: The crystal protein is produced during
    sporulation and is accumulated both as an inclusion and as part of
    the spore coat.
-!- PTM: Active after proteolytic processing.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyt1/cyt2 endotoxin family.
Plasmid; Sporulation; Toxin.
