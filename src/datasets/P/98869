-!- FUNCTION: Efflux pump driven by the proton motive force. Confers
    resistance to basic, aromatic and lipophilic drugs as well as
    neutral, non-aromatic, zwitterionic or non-aromatic hydrophilic
    antibiotics.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.
