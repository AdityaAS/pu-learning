-!- FUNCTION: This magnesium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis
    of ATP coupled with the transport of the calcium.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Ca(2+)(Cis) = ADP + phosphate +
    Ca(2+)(Trans).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=6;
      Comment=Isoform 1 and isoform 2 are expressed in the same
      tissues;
    Name=1; Synonyms=ATP2C1A;
      IsoId=P98194-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2; Synonyms=ATP2C1B, ATP2C1C;
      IsoId=P98194-2; Sequence=VSP_000409;
    Name=3; Synonyms=ATP2C1B;
      IsoId=P98194-3; Sequence=VSP_000408, VSP_000410;
    Name=4; Synonyms=ATP2C1A;
      IsoId=P98194-4; Sequence=VSP_000408;
    Name=5; Synonyms=ATP2C1B;

    Name=6; Synonyms=ATP2C1D;
      IsoId=P98194-6; Sequence=VSP_014102;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found in most tissues except colon, thymus,
    spleen and leukocytes. Most abundant in keratinocytes and kidney.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in ATP2C1 are the cause of Hailey-Hailey disease
    (HHD) [MIM:169600]; also known as benign familial pemphigus. HHD
    is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by persistent
    blisters and suprabasal cell separation (acantholysis) of the
    epidermis, due to impaired keratinocyte adhesion. Patients lacking
    all isoforms except isoform 2 have HHD.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IIA subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.4 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 8.
