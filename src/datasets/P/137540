-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the sodium-dependent uptake of extracellular
    L-proline. This protein is also capable of using lithium as the
    transport cation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Has been isolated from inner membrane preparations as a
    homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:solute symporter (SSF)
    (TC 2.A.21) family.
