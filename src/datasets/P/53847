-!- FUNCTION: GTP-driven Fe(2+) uptake system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Iron uptake is repressed by the global regulator Fur.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains a guanine-nucleotide-specific nucleotide-binding
    site that shows slow GTP hydrolysis.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Binding of GTP is required for an efficient Fe(2+)
    uptake.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the feoB (TC 9.A.8) family.
