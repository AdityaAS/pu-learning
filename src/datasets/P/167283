Retrograde regulation protein 3.
"A basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription complex in
yeast functions in a signaling pathway from mitochondria to the
nucleus.";
"Sequence analysis of a 78.6 kb segment of the left end of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome II.";

-!- FUNCTION: Transcription factor that regulates CIT2 gene
    expression. Binds to two identical sites oriented as inverted
    repeats 28 bp apart in a regulatory upstream activation sequence
    element (UASR) in the CIT2 promoter. The core binding site is 5'-
    GGTCAC-3'.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds DNA as a heterodimer with RTG1.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P32607:RTG1; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-16328, EBI-16312;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1050 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (CAA55992) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 310.
