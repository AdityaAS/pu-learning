-!- FUNCTION: Required for binding-protein-mediated phosphate
    transport.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- INDUCTION: By phosphate deprivation. Subject to positive control
    by the phoB gene product and to negative control by the phoR gene
    product.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pstS family.
