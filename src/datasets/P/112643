AC   P50332;
Nod factor export ATP-binding protein I (Nodulation ATP-binding
protein I).
"Identification of nodulation promoter (nod-box) regions of Rhizobium
galegae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex nodIJ involved in
    the export of LCO (lipo-chitin oligosaccharide) and a modified
    beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharide. Responsible
    for energy coupling to the transport system. Therefore this
    complex is implicated in the nodulation induction process (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (nodI) and two transmembrane proteins (nodJ) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
    Lipooligosaccharide exporter (TC 3.A.1.102) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
