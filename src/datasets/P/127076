(Ethylene insensitive root 1) (AtEIR1) (WAVY6).

required for gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana.";

-!- FUNCTION: Acts as a component of the auxin efflux carrier. Seems
    to be involved in the root-specific auxin transport, and mediates
    the root gravitropism. Its particular localization suggest a role
    in the translocation of auxin towards the elongation zone.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Root-specific. Localized to the cortex,
    epidermis and lateral root cap, predominantly at the upper side of
    cells.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Loss-of-function mutations impair the root
    gravitropic response, lead to an increased sensitivity to ethylene
    and auxin transport inhibitors, and give rise to an auxin
    accumulation in root tips.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the auxin efflux carrier (TC 2.A.69)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.5 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
