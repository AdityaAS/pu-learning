-!- FUNCTION: Involved in transporting tyrosine across the cytoplasmic
    membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Repressed by tyrosine and induced by phenylalanine
    under the control of regulatory protein tyrR.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid/polyamine transporter 2
    family. Mtr/tnaB/tyrP permease subfamily.
