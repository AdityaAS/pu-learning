AC   P68184; P07622;
Maltose transport system permease protein malG.
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for maltose; probably responsible for the translocation of the
    substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (malK), two transmembrane proteins (malG and malF) and a solute-
    binding protein (malE) (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. MalFG subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
