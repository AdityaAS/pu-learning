p-hydroxybenzoic acid efflux pump subunit aaeB (pHBA efflux pump
protein B).

"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Characterization of the Escherichia coli AaeAB efflux pump: a
metabolic relief valve?";
"Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Efflux pump whose substrates are p-hydroxybenzoic acid
    (pHBA), 6-hydroxy-2-naphthoic and 2-hydroxycinnamate. Could
    function as a metabolic relief valve, allowing to eliminate
    certain compounds when they accumulate to high levels in the cell.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Positively coregulated with aaeA and aaeX by aaeR.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Both aaeB and aaeA are required for the function of
    the efflux system.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aromatic acid exporter ArAE (TC 2.A.85)
    family.
