AC   P0A2I9; P02913;
Histidine transport system permease protein hisQ.
"Complete nucleotide sequence and identification of membrane
components of the histidine transport operon of S. typhimurium.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Topology of the hydrophobic membrane-bound components of the
histidine periplasmic permease. Comparison with other members of the
family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for histidine; probably responsible for the translocation of the
    substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. HisMQ subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
