AC   P49133;
Triose phosphate/phosphate translocator, chloroplast precursor (cTPT).
"Cloning and in vivo expression of functional triose
phosphate/phosphate translocators from C3- and C4-plants: evidence for
the putative participation of specific amino acid residues in the
recognition of phosphoenolpyruvate.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the export of fixed carbons from the
    chloroplasts into the cytosol in the form of triose phosphates. In
    addition, it can also bind and transport phosphoenolpyruvate,
    thereby increasing the photosynthetic efficiency of C4-plants.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein. Note=Located in zones of contact
    between the inner and outer membrane of the chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TPT transporter family. TPT
    (TC 2.A.7.9.1) subfamily.
