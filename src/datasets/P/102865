AC   P12234;
Phosphate carrier protein, mitochondrial precursor (PTP) (Solute
carrier family 25 member 3).
"The sequences of human and bovine genes of the phosphate carrier from
mitochondria contain evidence of alternatively spliced forms.";
"Sequence of the bovine mitochondrial phosphate carrier protein:
structural relationship to ADP/ATP translocase and the brown fat
mitochondria uncoupling protein.";
"Sequence of the N-terminal formic acid fragment and location of the
N-ethylmaleimide-binding site of the phosphate transport protein from
beef heart mitochondria.";
"Transmembrane topography of the mitochondrial phosphate carrier
explored by peptide-specific antibodies and enzymatic digestion.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transport of phosphate groups from the cytosol to the
    mitochondrial matrix. Phosphate is cotransported with H(+).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=A;
      IsoId=P12234-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=B;
      IsoId=P12234-2; Sequence=VSP_003268;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
