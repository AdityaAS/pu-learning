Iron(III) dicitrate transport system permease protein fecD.
"Nucleotide sequences of the fecBCDE genes and locations of the
proteins suggest a periplasmic-binding-protein-dependent transport
mechanism for iron(III) dicitrate in Escherichia coli.";

-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for citrate-dependent Fe(3+). Probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. FecCD subfamily.
