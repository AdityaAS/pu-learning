Voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC-1)
(Plasmalemmal porin) (Brain-derived voltage-dependent anion channel 1)
(BR1-VDAC).
"Cloning and in situ localization of a brain-derived porin that
constitutes a large-conductance anion channel in astrocytic plasma
membranes.";
"Ion channels in the lens.";
"Location of the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-reactive glutamate residue
in the bovine heart mitochondrial porin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Forms a channel through the mitochondrial outer membrane
    and also the plasma membrane. The channel at the outer
    mitochondrial membrane allows diffusion of small hydrophilic
    molecules; in the plasma membrane it is involved in cell volume
    regulation and apoptosis. It adopts an open conformation at low or
    zero membrane potential and a closed conformation at potentials
    above 30-40 mV. The open state has a weak anion selectivity
    whereas the closed state is cation-selective. May participate in
    the formation of the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC)
    responsible for the release of mitochondrial products that
    triggers apoptosis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with hexokinases (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane.
    Cell membrane.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominantly in brain astrocytes.
-!- DOMAIN: Consists mainly of membrane-spanning sided beta-sheets.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) binding on Glu-72
    inhibits hexokinase binding in vitro.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eukaryotic mitochondrial porin family.
