AC   P0AE74; P77405;
Citrate carrier (Citrate transporter) (Citrate/succinate antiporter).
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"Sequence of minutes 4-25 of Escherichia coli.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"The Escherichia coli citrate carrier CitT: a member of a novel
eubacterial transporter family related to the 2-oxoglutarate/malate
translocator from spinach chloroplasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the uptake of citrate in exchange to the
    efflux of succinate. Has a relatively broad specificity for C(4)-
    dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC13A transporter (TC 2.A.47) family.
    SODIT1 subfamily.
