Nitrate transport permease protein nrtB.
"Identification and characterization of a gene cluster involved in
nitrate transport in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC7942.";
"Complete sequence of chromosome 1 of Synechococcus elongatus PCC
7942.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably part of a high-affinity binding-protein-
    dependent transport system for nitrate; probably responsible for
    the translocation of the substrate across the membrane (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. CysTW subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
