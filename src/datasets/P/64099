Glutamine transport ATP-binding protein glnQ.
"Cloning and complete nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli
glutamine permease operon (glnHPQ).";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";

-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for glutamine. Probably responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer with 2 subunits of glnQ and 2 subunits of
    glnP.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0A6Y8:dnaK; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1120383, EBI-542092;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By lack of glutamine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
