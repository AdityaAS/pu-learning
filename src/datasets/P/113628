-!- FUNCTION: NQR complex catalyzes the reduction of ubiquinone-1 to
    ubiquinol by two successive reactions, coupled with the transport
    of Na(+) ions from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. The first step
    is catalyzed by nqrF, which accepts electrons from NADH and
    reduces ubiquinone-1 to ubisemiquinone by a one-electron transfer
    pathway.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone + Na(+)(In) = NAD(+) +
    ubiquinol + Na(+)(Out).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by Na(+) or K(+). Inhibited by
    silver.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of six subunits; nqrA, nqrB, nqrC, nqrD, nqrE
    and nqrF.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane (Potential).
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nqrF family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain.
