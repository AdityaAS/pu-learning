-!- FUNCTION: Somewhat implicated in the biogenesis of peroxisomes.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PEX19.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Peroxisome; peroxisomal membrane; peripheral
    membrane protein (Potential).

-!- DISEASE: Defects in PEX10 are a cause of Zellweger syndrome (ZS)
    [MIM:214100]; a severe form of the peroxisome-biogenesis disorders
    (PBDs), a group of genetically heterogeneous, lethal diseases that
    are characterized by neuronal, hepatic, and renal abnormalities,
    mental retardation, and, in their most severe form, death within
    the 1st year of life. Two forms of ZS are related to PEX10
    defects: complementation group 7 (CG7) and complementation group B
    (CGB). These are autosomal recessive disorders due to defective
    import mechanisms for peroxisomal matrix enzymes.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PEX10 are a cause of neonatal adrenodystrophy
    (NALD) [MIM:202370]. NALD is a progessively less severe form of
    the peroxisome-biogenesis disorders.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RING-type zinc finger.
