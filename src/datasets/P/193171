-!- FUNCTION: Thought to form a receptor-activated non-selective
    calcium permeant cation channel. Probably is operated by a
    phosphatidylinositol second messenger system activated by receptor
    tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors. Activated by
    diacylglycerol (DAG) in a membrane-delimited fashion,
    independently of protein kinase C, and by inositol-1,4,5-
    triphosphate receptors (ITPR) with bound IP3. May also be
    activated by internal calcium store depletion.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with TRPC1. Interacts with ITPR3.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P20591:MX1; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-520807, EBI-929476;
    P10686:Plcg1 (xeno); NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-520807, EBI-520788;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed predominantly in brain and at much
    lower levels in ovary, colon, small intestine, lung, prostate,
    placenta and testis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. STrpC
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 ANK repeats.
