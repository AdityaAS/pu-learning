Spore germination protein A2.
"The nucleotide sequence and gene organization of the gerA spore
germination operon of Bacillus subtilis 168.";
"The yvsA-yvqA (293 degrees - 289 degrees) region of the Bacillus
subtilis chromosome containing genes involved in metal ion uptake and
a putative sigma factor.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Mammalian integral membrane receptors are homologous to facilitators
and antiporters of yeast, fungi, and eubacteria.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the germinative response to L-alanine. Could
    be an amino acid transporter. Forms a complex at the inner spore
    membrane which acts as a receptor for L-alanine, thus is involved
    in the stimulation of germination in response to alanine. Can
    stimulate germination in the absence of gerD and gerK gene
    products (fructose and glucose receptors, respectively), but the
    response is improved in their presence.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed in the forespore compartment of the
    developing sporangium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. Spore germination protein (SGP) (TC 2.A.3.9) family.
