NADH-quinone oxidoreductase subunit 4 (EC 1.6.99.5) (NADH
dehydrogenase I chain 4) (NDH-1 subunit 4).

-!- FUNCTION: NDH-1 shuttles electrons from NADH, via FMN and iron-
    sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the respiratory chain. The
    immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is
    menaquinone. Couples the redox reaction to proton translocation
    (for every two electrons transferred, four hydrogen ions are
    translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus conserves
    the redox energy in a proton gradient required for the synthesis
    of ATP. The nqo4 subunit may contain the quinone-binding site.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + quinone = NAD(+) + quinol.
-!- SUBUNIT: NDH-1 is composed of 15 different subunits, nqo1 to
    nqo15. The complex has a L-shaped structure, with the hydrophobic
    arm (subunits nqo7, nqo8 and nqo10 to nqo14) embedded in the
    membrane and the hydrophilic peripheral arm (subunits nqo1 to
    nqo6, nqo9 and nqo15) protruding into the bacterial cytoplasm. The
    hydrophilic domain contains all the redox centers. Subunit nqo4
    interacts extensively with nqo6.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein;
    cytoplasmic side.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I 49 kDa subunit family.
