-!- FUNCTION: This protein is a component of a D-methionine permease,
    a binding protein-dependent, ATP-driven transport system.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0A6Y8:dnaK; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1114713, EBI-542092;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor (Probable).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The metNIQ system is also to be able to transport
    the toxic methionine analog alpha-methyl-methionine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nlpA lipoprotein family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.6 sequence differs from that shown in position 217
    onward due to a frameshift.
