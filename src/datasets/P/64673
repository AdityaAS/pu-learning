-!- FUNCTION: Glutamate gated chloride channel that is dual gated by
    glutamate and avermectin.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homomultimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
    Name=C;
      IsoId=Q94900-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=B;
      IsoId=Q94900-2; Sequence=VSP_051644, VSP_051646, VSP_051647;
    Name=A;
      IsoId=Q94900-3; Sequence=VSP_051645;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed throughout development.
-!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=27, 63, 66, 241, 345;
    Note=Partially edited. Edited by Adar.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Channels desensitize rapidly in the continued
    presence of glutamate and are activated by the glutamate analog
    ibotenate. In Xenopus oocytes, avermectins and nodulisporic acid
    directly activate channel conductance.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ligand-gated ionic channel (TC 1.A.9)
    family.
