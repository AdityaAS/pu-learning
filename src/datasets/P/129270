Outer membrane porin F precursor.
"Sequence and transcriptional start site of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa
outer membrane porin protein F gene.";
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
"Biofouling in water treatment systems: effect of membrane properties
on biofilm formation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Has porin activity, forming small water-filled channels.
    Also has a structural role in determining cell shape and ability
    to grow in low-osmolarity medium.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- PTM: Contains two disulfide bonds.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ompA family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 OmpA-like domain.
