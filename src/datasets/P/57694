-!- FUNCTION: This is a septum-peptidoglycan biosynthetic protein,
    involved in cell wall formation. Plays a role in the stabilization
    of the ftsZ ring during cell division.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ftsW/rodA/spoVE family.
