AC   Q29075;
Antimicrobial peptide NK-lysin precursor (NKL) (Fragment).
"NK-lysin, a novel effector peptide of cytotoxic T and NK cells.
Structure and cDNA cloning of the porcine form, induction by
interleukin 2, antibacterial and antitumour activity.";
"Saposin fold revealed by the NMR structure of NK-lysin.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be an effector molecule of cytotoxic activity. High
    activity against E.coli and B.megaterium, moderate against
    A.calcoaceticus and S.pyogenes. No activity against P.aeruginosa,
    S.aureus and Salmonella. Has some antifungal activity against
    C.albicans.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Cytotoxic T and NK cells.
-!- INDUCTION: By interleukin-2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 saposin B-type domain.
