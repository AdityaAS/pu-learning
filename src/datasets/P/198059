-!- FUNCTION: Involved in acetylcholine transport into synaptic
    vesicles.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Cytoplasmic vesicle; secretory vesicle;
    synaptic vesicle. Synaptic vesicles of cholinergic neurons.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Mutations produce deficits in neuromuscular
    function.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.
    Vesicular transporter family.
