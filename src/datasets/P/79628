"Primary structure of a new cysteine proteinase inhibitor from pig
leucocytes.";
"Pig leukocyte cysteine proteinase inhibitor (PLCPI), a new member of
the stefin family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably a microbicidal peptide.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cathelicidin family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) thought to be a thiol protease
    inhibitor. The inhibitory activity was due to the presence of
    leukocyte cysteine proteinase inhibitor and not to cathelin
    itself.
