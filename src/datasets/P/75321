Gamma-hemolysin component A precursor (H-gamma-2) (H-gamma-II).
"The gamma-hemolysin locus of Staphylococcus aureus comprises three
linked genes, two of which are identical to the genes for the F and S
components of leukocidin.";
"Gamma-hemolysin genes in the same family with lukF and lukS genes in
methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.";
"Substitution of lysine for arginine in the N-terminal 217th amino
acid residue of the H gamma II of Staphylococcal gamma-hemolysin
lowers the activity of the toxin.";
"Panton-Valentine leucocidin and gamma-hemolysin from Staphylococcus
aureus ATCC 49775 are encoded by distinct genetic loci and have
different biological activities.";
"The two Staphylococcal bi-component toxins, leukocidin and gamma-
hemolysin, share one component in common.";
"The interaction of Staphylococcus aureus bi-component gamma-
hemolysins and leucocidins with cells and lipid membranes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Toxin that seems to act by forming pores in the membrane
    of the cell. Has a hemolytic and a leucotoxic activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Toxicity requires sequential binding and synergistic
    association of a class S and a class F component which form
    heterooligomeric complexes. HlgA (class S) associates with hlgB
    (class F) thus forming an AB toxin in strains producing both
    gamma-hemolysins and leukocidins. HlgA and lukF-PV can also form a
    complex.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aerolysin family.
