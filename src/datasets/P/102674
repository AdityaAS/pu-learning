-!- FUNCTION: Required for the rotation of the flagellar motor. Might
    be a linker that fastens the torque-generating machinery to the
    cell wall.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass type II
    membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the motB family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 OmpA-like domain.
