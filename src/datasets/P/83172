"Sequence analysis of the groESL-cotA region of the Bacillus subtilis
genome, containing the restriction/modification system genes.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Identification of two myo-inositol transporter genes of Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Major myo-inositol uptake transporter.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate metabolism; myo-inositol degradation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: Negatively regulated by iolR. Induced by inositol.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: When iolT is inactivated, inositol uptake is almost
    abolished even though iolF is active.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
