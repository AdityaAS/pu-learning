-!- FUNCTION: Central component of the TOM (translocase of outer
    membrane) receptor complex responsible for the recognition and
    translocation of cytosolically synthesized mitochondrial
    preproteins. Together with TOM20 and TOM70 functions as the
    transit peptide receptor at the surface of the mitochondrion outer
    membrane and facilitates the movement of preproteins into the
    TOM40 translocation pore. Docks TOM20 and TOM70 for interaction
    with the general TOM40 import pore (GIP) complex. May regulate the
    TOM machinery organization, stability and channel gating.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms part of the TOM (translocase of outer membrane)
    complex that consists of at least 7 different proteins (TOM5,
    TOM6, TOM7, TOM20, TOM22, TOM40 and TOM70). Interacts with TOM20
    and TOM70.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane;
    single-pass type II membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: Its cytoplasmic domain associates with the cytoplasmic
    domains of TOM20 and TOM70. Its intermembrane space domain
    provides a trans binding site for presequences and the single
    membrane anchor is required for a stable interaction between the
    GIP complex proteins.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 6610 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tom22 family.
