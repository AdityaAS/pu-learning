AC   P24612;
Degenerin mec-4 (Mechanosensory abnormality protein 4).
"Sequence and transmembrane topology of MEC-4, an ion channel subunit
required for mechanotransduction in Caenorhabditis elegans.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
"The mec-4 gene is a member of a family of Caenorhabditis elegans
genes that can mutate to induce neuronal degeneration.";
"The mechanosensory protein MEC-6 is a subunit of the C. elegans
touch-cell degenerin channel.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable sodium channel subunit. May be needed for
    mechanosensory transduction (touch sensitivity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The channel is probably composed of at least the mec-2,
    mec-4, mec-6 and mec-10 subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Coexpressed with mec-6 in touch-cell axons.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Mutations in mec-4 results in the degeneration of a
    small set of neurons which typically swell to several time their
    normal diameter before they disappear, presumably due to lysis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel
    family.
