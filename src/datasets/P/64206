-!- FUNCTION: Glycerol enters the cell via the glycerol diffusion
    facilitator protein. This membrane protein facilitates the
    movement of glycerol across the cytoplasmic membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Requires glycerol 3-phosphate and the glpP product;
    repressed by glucose.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
