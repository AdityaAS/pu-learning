"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for glutamate and aspartate. Probably responsible for energy
    coupling to the transport system (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
