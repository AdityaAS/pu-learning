cotransporter 1) (Na(+)/PI cotransporter 1) (Solute carrier family 17
member 1) (Renal sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 1)
(Renal sodium-phosphate transport protein 1) (Renal Na(+)-dependent
phosphate cotransporter 1).
"Cloning, genetic mapping, and expression analysis of a mouse renal
sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter.";
"Interaction of the type IIa Na/Pi-cotransporter with PDZ proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Important for the resorption of phosphate by the kidney.
    May be involved in actively transporting phosphate into cells via
    Na(+) cotransport in the renal brush border membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PDZK1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Kidney.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.
    Sodium/anion cotransporter family.
Glycoprotein; Ion transport; Membrane; Sodium; Sodium transport;
