AC   P10332;
Major outer membrane porin precursor (MOMP).
"Chlamydia psittaci ewe abortion agent: complete nucleotide sequence
of the major outer membrane protein gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: In elementary bodies (EBs, the infectious stage, which
    is able to survive outside the host cell) provides the structural
    integrity of the outer envelope through disulfide cross-links with
    the small cysteine-rich protein and the large cysteine-rich
    periplasmic protein. It has been described in publications as the
    Sarkosyl-insoluble COMC (Chlamydia outer membrane complex), and
    serves as the functional equivalent of peptidoglycan (By
    similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: Permits diffusion of specific solutes through the outer
    membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of a disulfide cross-linked outer membrane complex
    (COMC) composed of the major outer membrane porin, the small
    cysteine-rich protein (omcA) and the large cysteine-rich
    periplasmic protein (omcB) (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: It is present but some of the disulfide bonds
    are reduced in the intracellular reticulate bodies (RBs).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chlamydial porin (CP) (TC 1.B.2)
    family.
