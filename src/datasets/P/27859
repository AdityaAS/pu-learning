AC   P60069;
Chlorate reductase subunit beta (Chlorate reductase iron-sulfur
subunit).
"A gene cluster for chlorate metabolism in Ideonella dechloratans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Electron transfer subunit of the terminal reductase
    during anaerobic growth on chlorate (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 3Fe-4S cluster (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 3 4Fe-4S clusters (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimer of alpha, beta and gamma subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm. Note=Probably translocated
    together with clrA, which possesses a Tat-type signal.
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Has potential use in bioremediation of waste sites
    contaminated with chlorate, such as pulp and paper industry
    wastewater.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
3Fe-4S; 4Fe-4S; Electron transport; Iron; Iron-sulfur; Metal-binding;
