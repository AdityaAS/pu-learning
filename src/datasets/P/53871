-!- FUNCTION: This protein is involved in the initial step of iron
    uptake by binding ferrienterobactin (Fe-ENT), an iron chelatin
    siderophore that allows E.coli to extract iron from the
    environment. FepA also acts as a receptor for colicins B and D.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tonB-dependent receptor family.
