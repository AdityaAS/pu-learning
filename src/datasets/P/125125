AC   P75905;
Biofilm PGA synthesis N-glycosyltransferase pgaC (EC 2.4.-.-).
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"The pgaABCD locus of Escherichia coli promotes the synthesis of a
polysaccharide adhesin required for biofilm formation.";
"Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the synthesis of the beta-1,6-GlcNAc
    polysaccharide (PGA) that seems to serve as a biofilm adhesin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Disruption of the pga operon causes severe and
    persistent defects in the biofilm formation process.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 2 family.
