Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM16
(Presequence translocated-associated motor subunit PAM16).
"A 37.5 kb region of yeast chromosome X includes the SME1, MEF2, GSH1
and CSD3 genes, a TCP-1-related gene, an open reading frame similar to
the DAL80 gene, and a tRNA(Arg).";

X.";

"The presequence translocase-associated protein import motor of
mitochondria. Pam16 functions in an antagonistic manner to Pam18.";
"Pam16 has an essential role in the mitochondrial protein import
motor.";
"The J domain-related cochaperone Tim16 is a constituent of the
mitochondrial TIM23 preprotein translocase.";
"The import motor of the yeast mitochondrial TIM23 preprotein
translocase contains two different J proteins, Tim14 and Mdj2.";
"Pam17 is required for architecture and translocation activity of the
mitochondrial protein import motor.";
"Role of Pam16's degenerate J domain in protein import across the
mitochondrial inner membrane.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential component of the PAM complex, a complex
    required for the translocation of transit peptide-containing
    proteins from the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix in
    an ATP-dependent manner. In the complex, it is required to
    regulate activity of mtHSP70 (SSC1) via its interaction with
    PAM18/TIM14. May act by positioning PAM18/TIM14 in juxtaposition
    to mtHSP70 at the translocon to maximize ATPase stimulation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer and heterodimer with PAM18. Homodimerization
    may not be relevant in vivo, while heterodimerizazion is essential
    for regulate activity of mtHSP70. Component of the PAM complex, at
    least composed of mtHsp70, MGE1, TIM44, PAM16, PAM17 and PAM18.
    Interacts with MDJ2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    peripheral membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The J-like region, although related to the J domain does
    not stimulate ATPase activity of mtHSP70. It nevertheless mediates
    the heterodimerization with the J domain of PAM18 and is therefore
    essential for PAM complex function.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 3180 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TIM16/PAM16 family.
