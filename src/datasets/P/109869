AC   Q28139; O46384;
Sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 1 (Na(+)/K(+)/Ca(2+)-exchange
protein 1) (Retinal rod Na-Ca+K exchanger).
"Primary structure and functional expression of the Na/Ca,K-exchanger
from bovine rod photoreceptors.";
"cDNA cloning of the human retinal rod Na-Ca + K exchanger: comparison
with a revised bovine sequence.";
"The retinal rod Na(+)/Ca(2+),K(+) exchanger contains a noncleaved
signal sequence required for translocation of the N-terminus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Critical component of the visual transduction cascade,
    controlling the calcium concentration of outer segments during
    light and darkness. Light causes a rapid lowering of cytosolic
    free calcium in the outer segment of both retinal rod and cone
    photoreceptors and the light-induced lowering of calcium is caused
    by extrusion via this protein which plays a key role in the
    process of light adaptation. Transports 1 Ca(2+) and 1 K(+) in
    exchange for 4 Na(+) (By similarity).
