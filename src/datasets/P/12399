-!- FUNCTION: Involved in copper efflux.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Cu(2+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    Cu(2+)(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: Transcriptionally regulated by cueR in response to
    Cu(+) or Ag(+) ions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 HMA domains.
