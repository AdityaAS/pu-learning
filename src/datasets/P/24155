-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the transport of chloride ions. May regulate
    bicarbonate secretion and salvage in epithelial cells by
    regulating the SLC4A7 transporter.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with SHANK2 (By similarity). Interacts with
    SLC9A3R1, MYO6 and GOPC. Interacts with SLC4A7 through SLC9A3R1.

      Note=Skipping of exon 9: a high number of TG repeats and a low
      number of T repeats at the intron 8-exon 9 junction favor exon
      skipping. Causes congenital bilateral absence of the vas
      deferens (CBAVD);

      IsoId=P13569-3; Sequence=VSP_022124, VSP_022125;
      Note=Skipping of the first 248 nucleotides of exon 13, caused by
      mutation of the exon splicing exon (ESE) in exon 13. Causes
      cystic fibrosis (CF);
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found on the surface of the epithelial cells
    that line the lungs and other organs.
-!- DOMAIN: The PDZ-binding motif mediates interactions with GOPC and
    with the SLC4A7, SLC9A3R1/EBP50 complex.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in CFTR are the cause of cystic fibrosis (CF)
    [MIM:219700]; also known as mucoviscidosis. CF is the most common
    genetic disease in the Caucasian population, with a prevalence of
    about 1 in 2000 live births. Inheritance is autosomal recessive.
    CF is a common generalized disorder of exocrine gland function
    which impairs clearance of secretions in a variety of organs. It
    is characterized by the triad of chronic bronchopulmonary disease
    (with recurrent respiratory infections), pancreatic insufficiency
    (which leads to malabsorption and growth retardation) and elevated
    sweat electrolytes.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in CFTR are the cause of congenital bilateral
    absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) [MIM:277180]. CBAVD is an
    important cause of sterility in men and could represent an
    incomplete form of cystic fibrosis, as the majority of men
    suffering from cystic fibrosis lack the vas deferens.

    transporter (TC 3.A.1.202) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transmembrane type-1 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
