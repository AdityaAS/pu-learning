-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for glutamate. L-glutamate acts as an
    excitatory neurotransmitter at many synapses in the central
    nervous system. The postsynaptic actions of Glu are mediated by a
    variety of receptors that are named according to their selective
    agonists. This receptor binds AMPA(quisqualate) > glutamate >
    kainate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Isoform 3 interacts with PRKCABP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.

    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
    Name=1; Synonyms=Flop;
      IsoId=P19493-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2; Synonyms=Flip;
      IsoId=P19493-2; Sequence=VSP_000123, VSP_000124, VSP_000125;
    Name=3; Synonyms=4C flop;
      IsoId=P19493-3; Sequence=VSP_000126;
-!- PTM: Palmitoylated. Depalmitoylated upon glutamate stimulation.
    Cys-611 palmitoylation leads to Golgi retention and decreased cell
    surface expression. In contrast, Cys-837 palmitoylation does not
    affect cell surface expression but regulates stimulation-dependent
    endocytosis (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glutamate-gated ion channel (TC 1.A.10)
    family.
