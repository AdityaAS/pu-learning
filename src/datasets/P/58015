AC   P05316;
Uracil permease.
"Primary structure of the uracil transport protein of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae.";
"The complete sequence of a 33 kb fragment on the right arm of
chromosome II from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals 16 open reading
frames, including ten new open reading frames, five previously
identified genes and a homologue of the SCO1 gene.";
"Complete DNA sequence of yeast chromosome II.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transport of uracil.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated (possible); but there is not yet direct
    biochemical evidence for it.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the purine-cytosine permease family.
