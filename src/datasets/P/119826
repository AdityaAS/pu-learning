-!- FUNCTION: Required for the insertion of integral membrane proteins
    into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Essential for the activity
    and assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. Plays a central role in the
    translocation and export of the N-terminal part of the COX2
    protein into the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with the large ribosome subunit of
    mitochondrial ribosome. Interacts directly with MRP20.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 6550 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the OXA1/oxaA family.
