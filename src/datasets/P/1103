Neutral amino acid transporter B (Insulin-activated amino acid
transporter) (ASC-like Na(+)-dependent neutral amino acid transporter
ASCT2).
"Expression of a novel insulin-activated amino acid transporter gene
during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes.";
"Cloning and functional characterization of a system ASC-like Na+-
dependent neutral amino acid transporter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Insulin-dependent transporter for L-serine and, to a
    lesser extent, uptake of L-alanine and L-glutamate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in adipose tissue, lower
    levels seen in lung. Not expressed in brain, kidney, liver or
    heart and only traces are detected in spleen, thymus and skeletal
    muscle.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed is induced during differentiation
    of preadipocytes into adipocytes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:dicarboxylate (SDF) symporter
    (TC 2.A.23) family.
