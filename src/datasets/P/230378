AC   O34315;
Probable amino-acid ABC transporter permease protein ytmL.
"Sequencing and functional annotation of the Bacillus subtilis genes
in the 200 kb rrnB-dnaB region.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably part of the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system ytmKLMN for an amino acid. Probably responsible for the
    translocation of the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. HisMQ subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
