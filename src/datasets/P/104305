-!- FUNCTION: Mechanosensitive channel that participates in the
    regulation of osmotic pressure changes within the cell. Forms an
    ion channel of 1.0 nanosiemens conductance with a slight
    preference for anions. The channel is sensitive to voltage (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homoheptamer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mscS (TC 1.A.23) family.
