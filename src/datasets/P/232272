AC   P32804;
Zinc-regulated transporter 1 (High-affinity zinc transport protein
ZRT1).
"Identification of a gene encoding a novel zinc finger protein in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"Sequence of a 39,411 bp DNA fragment covering the left end of
chromosome VII of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII.";
"The ZRT2 gene encodes the low affinity zinc transporter in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity zinc transport protein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Induced in activity >100-fold in response to zinc-
    limiting growth conditions. Not expressed in zinc-replete cells.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibited by Cu(2+) and Fe(3+) ions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ZIP transporter (TC 2.A.5) family.
