-!- FUNCTION: This is the non-catalytic component of the active
    enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the
    exchange of Na(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane. The
    beta subunit regulates, through assembly of alpha/beta
    heterodimers, the number of sodium pumps transported to the plasma
    membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of three subunits: alpha (catalytic), beta and
    gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=P05026-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=P05026-2; Sequence=VSP_000349;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found in most tissues.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Na+/K+ and H+/K+ ATPases subunit beta
    family.
