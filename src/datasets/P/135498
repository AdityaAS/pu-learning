Fructose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIB component
(EC 2.7.1.69) (PTS system fructose-specific EIIB component) (EIIB-Fru)
(p18).
"Levanase operon of Bacillus subtilis includes a fructose-specific
phosphotransferase system regulating the expression of the operon.";
"A 23911 bp region of the Bacillus subtilis genome comprising genes
located upstream and downstream of the lev operon.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Crystal structure of the IIB subunit of a fructose permease (IIBLev)
from Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in fructose transport.
-!- FUNCTION: LevD and levE act as negative regulators of the levanase
    operon. They may be involved in a PTS-mediated phosphorylation of
    a regulator.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine + sugar = protein EIIB + sugar phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIB domain is phosphorylated by phospho-EIIA on a
    cysteinyl or histidyl residue, depending on the transported sugar.
    Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the sugar substrate
    concomitantly with the sugar uptake processed by the EIIC domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIB type-4 domain.
