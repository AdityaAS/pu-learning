AC   P42054;
Outer plastidial membrane protein porin (Voltage-dependent anion-
selective channel protein) (VDAC).
"Porins from plants. Molecular cloning and functional characterization
of two new members of the porin family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Forms a channel through the cell membrane that allows
    diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules. The channel adopts an
    open conformation at low or zero membrane potential and a closed
    conformation at potentials above 30-40 mV. The open state has a
    weak anion selectivity whereas the closed state is cation-
    selective (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; plastid outer membrane. Note=Found
    in non-photosynthetic root plastids only.
-!- DOMAIN: Consists mainly of membrane-spanning sided beta-sheets.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eukaryotic mitochondrial porin family.
