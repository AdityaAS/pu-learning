AC   Q9ZAA6;
Glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase subunit beta (EC 4.1.1.70)
(Carboxylyase).
"The sodium ion translocating glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase from
Acidaminococcus fermentans: cloning and function of the genes forming
a second operon.";
-!- FUNCTION: Tunnel subunit of the primary sodium pump glutaconyl-CoA
    decarboxylase (GCD).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4-carboxybut-2-enoyl-CoA = but-2-enoyl-CoA +
    CO(2).
-!- PATHWAY: Anaerobic glutamate metabolism; fifth step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooctamer consisting of two alpha, two beta, two
    gamma and two delta subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gcdB/mmdB/oadB family.
