Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (Sodium-dependent
glutamate/aspartate transporter 1) (Glial glutamate transporter)
(GLAST) (GLAST-1).
"Structure, expression, and functional analysis of a Na(+)-dependent
glutamate/aspartate transporter from rat brain.";

transporter. Copurification, separation and characterization of the
two glycoproteins.";

cochlea.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transports L-glutamate and also L- and D-aspartate.
    Essential for terminating the postsynaptic action of glutamate by
    rapidly removing released glutamate from the synaptic cleft. Acts
    as a symport by cotransporting sodium.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=GLAST-1;
      IsoId=P24942-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=GLAST-1A;
      IsoId=P24942-2; Sequence=VSP_006263;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Both isoforms are expressed in bone and brain.
    In brain isoform GLAST-1 is highly enriched in the Purkinje cell
    layer in cerebellum.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:dicarboxylate (SDF) symporter
    (TC 2.A.23) family.
