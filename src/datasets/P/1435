Bile salt export pump (ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 11).
"A gene encoding a liver-specific ABC transporter is mutated in
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis.";
"Cellular localization and functional characterization of the human
bile salt export pump (BSEP).";
"Three hundred twenty-six genetic variations in genes encoding nine
members of ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B (ABCB/MDR/TAP), in the
Japanese population.";
"FIC1 and BSEP defects in Taiwanese patients with chronic intrahepatic
cholestasis with low gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase levels.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the ATP-dependent secretion of bile salts
    into the canaliculus of hepatocytes.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed predominantly, if not exclusively in
    the liver, where it was further localized to the canalicular
    microvilli and to subcanalicular vesicles of the hepatocytes by in
    situ (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Multifunctional polypeptide with two homologous halves,
    each containing an hydrophobic membrane-anchoring domain and an
    ATP binding cassette (ABC) domain.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in ABCB11 are the cause of progressive familial
    intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC2) [MIM:601847]. PFIC2 is an
    inherited liver disease of childhood which is characterized by
    cholestasis and normal serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity.
    Defects in ABCB11 are also found in cases of chronic intrahepatic
    cholestasis without obvious familial history of chronic liver
    disease.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transmembrane type-1 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
