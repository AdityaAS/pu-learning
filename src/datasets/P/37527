permease II and a putative human tumour suppressor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Uptake of sulfate into the cell.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Mainly found in mycelia.
-!- INDUCTION: Highly expressed, but only in cells subject to sulfur
    limitation, and it is turned on by the positive-acting 'Cys-3'
    sulfur regulatory protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC26A/SulP transporter (TC 2.A.53)
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 STAS domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to several
    frameshifts.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
