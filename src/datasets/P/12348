AC   Q29449;
Probable phospholipid-transporting ATPase IA (EC 3.6.3.1) (Chromaffin
granule ATPase II) (ATPase class I type 8A member 1).
"A subfamily of P-type ATPases with aminophospholipid transporting
activity.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play a role in the transport of aminophospholipids
    from the outer to the inner leaflet of various membranes and the
    maintenance of asymmetric distribution of phospholipids, mainly in
    secretory vesicles.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O = ADP + phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic vesicle; secretory vesicle;
    chromaffin granule; chromaffin granule membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Kidney.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IV subfamily.
