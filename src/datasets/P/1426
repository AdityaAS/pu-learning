-!- FUNCTION: Could be involved in the transport of heme from the
    mitochondria to the cytosol. Plays a central role in the
    maturation of cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster-containing
    proteins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer or heterodimer (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:

      IsoId=O75027-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O75027-2; Sequence=VSP_014635;
-!- DISEASE: Defects in ABCB7 are the cause of X-linked sideroblastic
    anemia with ataxia (ASAT) [MIM:301310]. ASAT is a recessive
    disorder characterized by an infantile to early childhood onset of
    nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia and mild anemia with hypochromia
    and microcytosis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. MDR subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
