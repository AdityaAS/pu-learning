-!- FUNCTION: This is the heme A-containing chain of cytochrome c
    oxidase, the terminal oxidase in mitochondrial electron transport.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Cytochrome c oxidase is composed of 11 subunits: one copy
    each of COX1, COX2, COX3, COX4, COX5A or COX5B, COX6, COX7, COX9,
    COX12, COX13 and two copies of COX8.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 12500 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase Va family.
