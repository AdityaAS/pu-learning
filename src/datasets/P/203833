AC   P0A3W5; P09780;
Outer membrane lipoprotein virB7 precursor.
"Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence of the Agrobacterium
tumefaciens virB operon.";
"Octopine-type Ti plasmid sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Is essential for the biogenesis of the T-pilus, which is
    required for virulence and T-DNA transfer to plant cells. When is
    associated with virB9, might function as a nucleation center for
    recruitment of virB proteins during assembly of the T-DNA transfer
    machine (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer and heterodimer of virB7 and virB9; disulfide-
    linked (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; lipid-anchor. Note=Also
    associated with the T-pilus when is a homodimer, possibly at the
    pilus base (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Is protease-resistant (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Both virB7 lipid modification and disulfide cross-
    linking are important for T-pilus assembly.
