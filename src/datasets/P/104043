AC   Q01926;
Magnesium transporter MRS2, mitochondrial precursor (RNA-splicing
protein MRS2).
"The nuclear gene MRS2 is essential for the excision of group II
introns from yeast mitochondrial transcripts in vivo.";
"A multitude of suppressors of group II intron-splicing defects in
yeast.";
"Sequence of 29 kb around the PDR10 locus on the right arm of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XV: similarity to part of

mitochondria involves an export step from the matrix.";
"Mrs2p is an essential component of the major electrophoretic Mg2+
influx system in mitochondria.";

-!- FUNCTION: Magnesium transporter that mediates the influx of
    magnesium into the mitochondiral matrix. MRS2 is essential for the
    splicing of mRNA group II introns and its absence may disturb the
    assembly of mitochondrial membrane complexes. It also suppresses a
    variety of mitochondrial intron mutations.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 768 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the corA metal ion transporter (MIT)
    (TC 1.A.35) family.
