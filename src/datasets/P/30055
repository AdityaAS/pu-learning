AC   P39695;
ComE operon protein 3.
"Characterization of comE, a late competence operon of Bacillus
subtilis required for the binding and uptake of transforming DNA.";
"Systematic sequencing of the 283 kb 210 degrees-232 degrees region of
the Bacillus subtilis genome containing the skin element and many
sporulation genes.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The comE operon is required for the binding and uptake
    of transforming DNA. ComEC is required for internalization but is
    dispensable for DNA binding.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: To H.influenzae REC2, N.gonorrhoeae comA and E.coli
    ycaI.
