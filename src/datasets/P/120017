-!- FUNCTION: Anion transporter that carries out the exchange of
    divalent oxalate with monovalent formate, the product of oxalate
    decarboxylation, at the plasma membrane, and in doing so catalyzes
    the vectorial portion of a proton-motive metabolic cycle that
    drives ATP synthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The protein has a two-fold symmetry axis, with a central
    cavity which may be associated with substrate transport. Residues
    contributed from seven transmembrane helices probably line the
    substrate transport pathway.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Its velocity of transport is the highest one known
    so far among transporters of organic molecules.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. OFA
    (TC 2.A.1.11) family.
