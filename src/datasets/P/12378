AC   P22189;
Calcium-transporting ATPase 3 (EC 3.6.3.8).
"Calcium homeostasis and transport are affected by disruption of cta3,
a novel gene encoding Ca2(+)-ATPase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: This magnesium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis
    of ATP coupled with the transport of the calcium.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Ca(2+)(Cis) = ADP + phosphate +
    Ca(2+)(Trans).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IID subfamily.
