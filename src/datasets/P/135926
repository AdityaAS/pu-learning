PTS system lactose-specific EIICB component (EIICB-Lac) (EII-Lac)
[Includes: Lactose permease IIC component (PTS system lactose-specific
EIIC component); Lactose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIB
component (EC 2.7.1.69) (PTS system lactose-specific EIIB component)].
"Identification of the genes for the lactose-specific components of
the phosphotransferase system in the lac operon of Staphylococcus
aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in lactose transport.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine + sugar = protein EIIB + sugar phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIC domain forms the PTS system translocation channel
    and contains the specific substrate-binding site.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIB domain is phosphorylated by phospho-EIIA on a
    cysteinyl or histidyl residue, depending on the transported sugar.
    Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the sugar substrate
    concomitantly with the sugar uptake processed by the EIIC domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIB type-3 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIC type-3 domain.
