AC   P0AG97; P16920;
Preprotein translocase secE subunit.
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential for protein export (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus
    which comprise secA, secB, secD, secE, secF, secG and secY. The
    translocation channel seems to be composed of a secA homodimer and
    four copies of a secYEG complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secE/SEC61-gamma family.
