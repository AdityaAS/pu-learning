AC   O54701; O54706;
Sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 2 precursor (Na(+)/K(+)/Ca(2+)-
exchange protein 2) (Retinal cone Na-Ca+K exchanger).
"Molecular cloning of a novel potassium-dependent sodium-calcium
exchanger from rat brain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Critical component of the visual transduction cascade,
    controlling the calcium concentration of outer segments during
    light and darkness. Light causes a rapid lowering of cytosolic
    free calcium in the outer segment of both retinal rod and cone
    photoreceptors and the light-induced lowering of calcium is caused
    by extrusion via this protein which plays a key role in the
    process of light adaptation. Transports 1 Ca(2+) and 1 K(+) in
    exchange for 4 Na(+).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed abundantly in all regions of the
    brain and weakly in the eye, large intestine and adrenal tissue.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger
    family. SLC24A subfamily.
