AC   P0A3W6; P05358; P09782;
Protein virB9 precursor.
"Characterization of the virB operon from an Agrobacterium tumefaciens
Ti plasmid.";
"Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB7 and VirB9 form a disulfide-linked
protein complex.";
-!- FUNCTION: Is essential for the biogenesis of the T-pilus, which is
    required for virulence and T-DNA transfer to plant cells. When is
    associated with virB7, might function as a nucleation center for
    recruitment of virB proteins during assembly of the T-DNA transfer
    machine.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of virB7 and virB9; disulfide-linked.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein.
Crown gall tumor; Membrane; Plasmid; Signal; Virulence.
