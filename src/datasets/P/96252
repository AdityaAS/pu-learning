-!- FUNCTION: Permease that is involved in the transport across the
    cytoplasmic membrane of lysine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: High, in anaerobic media of low pH, containing lysine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. Amino acid transporter (AAT) (TC 2.A.3.1) family.
