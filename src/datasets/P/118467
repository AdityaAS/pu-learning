typhimurium.";
"Nucleotide binding by membrane components of bacterial periplasmic
binding protein-dependent transport systems.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for oligopeptides. Probably responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
