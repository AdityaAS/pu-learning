AC   Q54957;
Lantibiotic streptococcin A-M49 precursor (Antibacterial peptide A-
M49).
"Duplication of the lantibiotic structural gene in M-type 49 group A
streptococcus strains producing streptococcin A-M49.";
-!- FUNCTION: Lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic)
    active on certain Gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal
    activity of lantibiotics is based on depolarization of energized
    bacterial cytoplasmic membranes, initiated by the formation of
    aqueous transmembrane pores (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein; extracellular space (By
    similarity). Cell surface (By similarity). Note=Either cell
    associated or in a released extracellular form (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of
    Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether
    bonds with cysteine. This is followed by membrane translocation
    and cleavage of the modified precursor (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: There are two genes coding for lantibiotic
    streptococcin A-M49, their coding sequences only differ in the
    propeptide region.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type A lantibiotic family.
Antibiotic; Antimicrobial; Bacteriocin; Lantibiotic; Thioether bond.
