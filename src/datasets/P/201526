-!- FUNCTION: Subunit of the peripheral V1 complex of vacuolar ATPase
    essential for assembly or catalytic function. V-ATPase is
    responsible for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments
    in eukaryotic cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (components A to H) attached to an
    integral membrane V0 proton pore complex (components: a, c, c',
    c'', d and e). VMA4 forms a homodimer within this complex and
    interacts directly with VMA5 and VMA10. Interacts with RAV1 and
    RAV2 components of the RAVE complex, which are essential for the
    stability and assembly of V-ATPase.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P47104:RAV1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-20268, EBI-25471;
    P32366:VMA6; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-20268, EBI-20201;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; peripheral
    membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 16134 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase E subunit family.
