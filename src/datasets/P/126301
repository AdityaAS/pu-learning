AC   P25297;
Inorganic phosphate transporter PHO84.
"The PHO84 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an inorganic
phosphate transporter.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
XIII.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
"A proteomics approach to understanding protein ubiquitination.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity transporter for external inorganic
    phosphate. Is not an essential protein, since a constitutive, low
    affinity pI transporter exists in yeast.
-!- SUBUNIT: May function as a monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Under the control of phosphate. It is derepressed by
    phosphate starvation.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 335000 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
