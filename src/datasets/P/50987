-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + a
    [protein]-L-tyrosine phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- PTM: Autophosphorylated. Dephosphorylated by etp.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the etk/wzc family.
-!- CAUTION: Seems to be expressed only in enteropathogenic E.coli
    strains.
