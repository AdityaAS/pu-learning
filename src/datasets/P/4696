AC   Q9Z3R7;
Alpha-glucoside transport system permease protein aglG.
"A novel Sinorhizobium meliloti operon encodes an alpha-glucosidase
and a periplasmic-binding-protein-dependent transport system for
alpha-glucosides.";
"Analysis of the chromosome sequence of the legume symbiont
Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for alpha-glucosides such as sucrose, maltose and trehalose.
    Probably responsible for the translocation of the substrate across
    the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. MalFG subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
