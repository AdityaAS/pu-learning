AC   P0AAJ2; P77313;
Probable anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase chain ynfG (DMSO
reductase iron-sulfur subunit ynfG).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Electron transfer subunit of the terminal reductase
    during anaerobic growth on various sulfoxide and N-oxide compounds
    (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 4 4Fe-4S clusters (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex consist of three subunits: ynfF, the
    reductase; ynfG, an electron transfer protein, and ynfH, a
    membrane anchor protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
