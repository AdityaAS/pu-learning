-!- FUNCTION: H(+)-stimulated, highly selective, manganese uptake
    system. Can also transport cadmium, cobalt, iron, zinc and to a
    lesser extent nickel and copper. Involved in response to reactive
    oxygen.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NRAMP family.
