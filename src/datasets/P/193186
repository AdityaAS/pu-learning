AC   Q9WVC5;
Short transient receptor potential channel 7 (TrpC7) (mTRP7).
"Molecular and functional characterization of a novel mouse transient
receptor potential protein homologue TRP7. Ca(2+)-permeable cation
channel that is constitutively activated and enhanced by stimulation
of G protein-coupled receptor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Thought to form a receptor-activated non-selective
    calcium permeant cation channel. Probably is operated by a
    phosphatidylinositol second messenger system activated by receptor
    tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors. Activated by
    diacylglycerol (DAG). May also be activated by intracellular
    calcium store depletion.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. STrpC
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 ANK repeats.
