AC   P0A0D6; P02909;
Lactose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA component (EC 2.7.1.-)
(PTS system lactose-specific EIIA component) (EIIA-Lac) (EIII-Lac).
"Identification of the genes for the lactose-specific components of
the phosphotransferase system in the lac operon of Staphylococcus
aureus.";
"Amino acid sequence of the amphiphilic phosphocarrier protein factor
IIILac of the lactose-specific phosphotransferase system of
Staphylococcus.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in lactose transport (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIA N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine +
    protein EIIB = protein EIIA + protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium or manganese ion per trimer (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIA domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr on a
    histidyl residue. Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the
    EIIB domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIA type-3 domain.
