-!- FUNCTION: Phospholamban has been postulated to regulate the
    activity of the calcium pump of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homopentamer.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q09013:DMPK; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-692836, EBI-692774;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Heart.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PLN are the cause of dilated cardiomyopathy 1P
    (CMD1P) [MIM:609909]. Cardiomyopathy is a disorder characterized
    by cardiac dilation and reduced systolic function.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phospholamban family.
