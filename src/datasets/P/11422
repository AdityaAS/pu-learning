Arsenite resistance protein arsB.
"Complete nucleotide sequence of a skin element excised by DNA
rearrangement during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.";
"Systematic sequencing of the 283 kb 210 degrees-232 degrees region of
the Bacillus subtilis genome containing the skin element and many
sporulation genes.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Analysis of a Bacillus subtilis genome fragment using a co-operative
computer system prototype.";
"The ars operon in the skin element of Bacillus subtilis confers
resistance to arsenate and arsenite.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to confer resistance to arsenite by allowing cells
    to extrude this compound. Could be part of an arsenite extrusion
    pump.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Deletion of the arsB gene results in both an
    aresenite- and arsenate-sensitive phenotype in the absence of
    IPTG.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ACR3 family.
Arsenical resistance; Complete proteome; Membrane; Transmembrane.
