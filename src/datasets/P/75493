AC   Q59465;
Cadmium, zinc and cobalt-transporting ATPase (EC 3.6.3.3)
(EC 3.6.3.5).
"Cloning and membrane topology of a P type ATPase from Helicobacter
pylori.";
"The complete genome sequence of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter
pylori.";
"Helicobacter pylori cadA encodes an essential Cd(II)-Zn(II)-Co(II)
resistance factor influencing urease activity.";
"Membrane topology of CadA homologous P-type ATPase of Helicobacter
pylori as determined by expression of phoA fusions in Escherichia coli
and the positive inside rule.";
-!- FUNCTION: Couples the hydrolysis of ATP with the transport of
    cadmium, zinc and cobalt out of the cell. This ion efflux may
    influence the activity of urease, which is essential for the
    survival of the bacterium in the gastric environment.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Cd(2+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    Cd(2+)(Out).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Zn(2+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    Zn(2+)(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HMA domain.
