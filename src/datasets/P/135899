Galactitol-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA component
(EC 2.7.1.-) (PTS system galactitol-specific EIIA component) (EIIA-
Gat).
"Sequence of the gat operon for galactitol utilization from a wild-
type strain EC3132 of Escherichia coli.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in galactitol transport.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIA N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine +
    protein EIIB = protein EIIA + protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIA domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr on a
    histidyl residue. Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the
    EIIB domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIA type-2 domain.
-!- CAUTION: In strain W3110, the sequence is interrupted by the
    insertion of an IS5 element between positions 69 and 70.
