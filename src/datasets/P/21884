AC   P45706;
Cytochrome c-type biogenesis protein ccdA.
"New genes in the 170 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis genome
encode DNA gyrase subunits, a thioredoxin, a xylanase and an amino
acid transporter.";
"Identification and characterization of the ccdA gene, required for
cytochrome c synthesis in Bacillus subtilis.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Efficient spore synthesis in Bacillus subtilis depends on the CcdA
protein.";
"Mutations in the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases BdbC and BdbD can
suppress cytochrome c deficiency of CcdA-defective Bacillus subtilis
cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for cytochrome c synthesis and stage V of
    sporulation. Might transfer reducing equivalents across the
    cytoplasmic membrane, promoting efficient disulfide bond
    isomerization of proteins localized on the outer surface of the
    membrane or in the spore coat.
-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome c oxidase activity is partially restored by
    mutations in bdbC or bdbD that are defective in the synthesis of
    disulfide bond containing proteins. The same mutations abrogate
    the need for ccdA in sporulation.
-!- PATHWAY: Cytochrome c synthesis system II.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dsbD family.
