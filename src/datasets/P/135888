Lichenan-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIB component
(EC 2.7.1.69) (PTS system lichenan-specific EIIB component) (EIIB-
Lic).
"Identification and characterization of a new beta-glucoside
utilization system in Bacillus subtilis.";
"Sequencing of a 65 kb region of the Bacillus subtilis genome
containing the lic and cel loci, and creation of a 177 kb contig

subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in lichenan transport.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine + sugar = protein EIIB + sugar phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by lichenan, lichenan hydrolysate and
    cellobiose. Subject to carbon catabolite repression.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIB domain is phosphorylated by phospho-EIIA on a
    cysteinyl or histidyl residue, depending on the transported sugar.
    Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the sugar substrate
    concomitantly with the sugar uptake processed by the EIIC domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIB type-3 domain.
