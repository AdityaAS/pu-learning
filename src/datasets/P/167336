AC   P15377;
RTX-II toxin determinant A (APX-IIA) (Hemolysin IIA) (HLY-IIA)
(Cytolysin IIA) (CLY-IIA).
"Cloning and characterization of a hemolysin gene from Actinobacillus
(Haemophilus) pleuropneumoniae.";
"Cytolysins of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 9.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the virulence factors of A.pleuropneumoniae,
    which shows a weak hemolytic activity and is moderately cytotoxic
    for alveolar macrophages and neutrophils.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The Gly-rich region is probably involved in binding
    calcium, which is required for target cell-binding or cytolytic
    activity (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The three transmembrane domains are believed to be
    involved in pore formation by the cytotoxin (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Palmitoylated by apxIIC. The toxin only becomes active when
    modified (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RTX prokaryotic toxin (TC 1.C.11)
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 hemolysin-type calcium-binding repeats.
