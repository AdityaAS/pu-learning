AC   P22522;
Colicin-V precursor (Microcin-V bacteriocin).
"Genetic analysis of an MDR-like export system: the secretion of
colicin V.";
"Characterization of a hemoglobin protease secreted by the pathogenic
Escherichia coli strain EB1.";
"The leader peptide of colicin V shares consensus sequences with
leader peptides that are common among peptide bacteriocins produced by
Gram-positive bacteria.";
"Purification and characterization of colicin V from Escherichia coli
culture supernatants.";
-!- FUNCTION: Colicin V kills sensitive cells by disrupting the
    membrane potential.
-!- FUNCTION: Colicins are polypeptide toxins produced by, and active
    against, Escherichia coli and closely related bacteria.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein. Note=Secreted by the
    cvaAB/tolC export system.
