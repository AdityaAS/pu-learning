AC   P49653; O54868;
P2X purinoceptor 2 (ATP receptor) (P2X2) (Purinergic receptor).
"New structural motif for ligand-gated ion channels defined by an
ionotropic ATP receptor.";
"Desensitization of the P2X(2) receptor controlled by alternative
splicing.";
"Identification of a short form of the P2xR1-purinoceptor subunit
produced by alternative splicing in the pituitary and cochlea.";
"Intracellular disulfide bond that affects ATP responsiveness of
P2X(2) receptor/channel.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binding of this ligand gated ion channel to ATP mediates
    synaptic transmission between neurons and from neurons to smooth
    muscle.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homo- or heteropolymers.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
