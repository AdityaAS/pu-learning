AC   P39851;
Putative tyrosine-protein kinase capB (EC 2.7.10.2).
"Sequence analysis and molecular characterization of genes required
for the biosynthesis of type 1 capsular polysaccharide in
Staphylococcus aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the biosynthesis of type 1 capsular
    polysaccharide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + a
    [protein]-L-tyrosine phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cpsD/capB family.
