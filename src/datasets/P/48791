Multidrug resistance protein A.
"Emr, an Escherichia coli locus for multidrug resistance.";
"Construction of a contiguous 874-kb sequence of the Escherichia coli-
K12 genome corresponding to 50.0-68.8 min on the linkage map and
analysis of its sequence features.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Multidrug resistance pumps in bacteria: variations on a theme.";
-!- FUNCTION: The emr locus confers resistance to substances of high
    hydrophobicity. EmrA probably participate in a transport system to
    extrude toxins and drugs from the cell.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the membrane fusion protein (MFP)
    (TC 8.A.1) family.
