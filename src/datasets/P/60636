AC   P15431;
Gamma-aminobutyric-acid receptor subunit beta-1 precursor (GABA(A)
receptor subunit beta-1).
"GABAA receptor beta subunit heterogeneity: functional expression of
cloned cDNAs.";
"GABAA-receptor expressed from rat brain alpha- and beta-subunit cDNAs
displays potentiation by benzodiazepine receptor ligands.";
-!- FUNCTION: GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
    vertebrate brain, mediates neuronal inhibition by binding to the
    GABA/benzodiazepine receptor and opening an integral chloride
    channel.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds UBQLN1 (By similarity). Generally pentameric. There
    are five types of GABA(A) receptor chains: alpha, beta, gamma,
    delta, and rho.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ligand-gated ionic channel (TC 1.A.9)
    family.
