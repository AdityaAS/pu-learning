Sensory rhodopsin-1 (Sensory rhodopsin I) (SR-I).
"Primary structure of sensory rhodopsin I, a prokaryotic
photoreceptor.";
"Primary structure of an archaebacterial transducer, a methyl-
accepting protein associated with sensory rhodopsin I.";
"Genome sequence of Halobacterium species NRC-1.";
"Conformational changes in sensory rhodopsin I: similarities and
differences with bacteriorhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and rhodopsin.";
"Three-dimensional model of sensory rhodopsin I reveals important
restraints between the protein and the chromophore.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the control of phototaxis. Mediates both
    photoattractant (in the red) and photophobic (in the near UV)
    responses. Seems to activate a methyl-accepting protein (HTR-I).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the archaeal/bacterial/fungal opsin family.
