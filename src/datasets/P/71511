-!- FUNCTION: Probable permease involved in the uptake of 3-
    phenylpropionic acid.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lacY/rafB permease family. HcaT
    subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (CAA86021) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 208.
