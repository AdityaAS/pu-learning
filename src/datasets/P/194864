Toluene efflux pump membrane transporter ttgB.
"Efflux pumps involved in toluene tolerance in Pseudomonas putida DOT-
T1E.";
"Three efflux pumps are required to provide efficient tolerance to
toluene in Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E.";
"Antibiotic-dependent induction of Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E TtgABC
efflux pump is mediated by the drug binding repressor TtgR.";
-!- FUNCTION: The inner membrane transporter component of a
    constitutive organic solvent efflux system. Involved in export of
    toluene, styrene, m-xylene, propylbenzene and ethylbenzene. Also
    exports AMP and the antibiotics carbenicillin, nalidixic acid,
    chloramphenicol and tetracycline.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: The ttgABC operon is repressed by toluene; this is
    mediated by ttgR. The ttgABC operon is induced in response to
    chloramphenicol and tetracycline.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acrB/acrD/acrF (TC 2.A.6) family.
-!- CAUTION: There are 4 nearly identical operons in various strains
    of P.putida. This one and the mepABC operon of strain KT2442-TOL
    function in solvent and antibiotic efflux; however the arpABC
    operon of strain S12 functions only in antibiotic efflux. This may
    be due to different protein expression levels. In strain KT2440
    the equivalent operon does not seem to function in toluene efflux.
