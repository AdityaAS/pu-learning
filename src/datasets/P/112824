AC   P25197; P25198; P25199;
Nodulation protein nolG precursor.
"Six nodulation genes of nod box locus 4 in Rhizobium meliloti are
involved in nodulation signal production: nodM codes for D-glucosamine
synthetase.";
"Nucleotide sequence and predicted functions of the entire
Sinorhizobium meliloti pSymA megaplasmid.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the production of Medicago-specific
    nodulation signal molecule.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (CAA41489) sequence differs from that shown due to
    several frameshifts. Therefore, it was thought to be three
    separate ORFs named nolG, nolH and nolI.
