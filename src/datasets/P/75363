Hemolysin, chromosomal.
"Nucleotide sequence of an Escherichia coli chromosomal hemolysin.";
"Characterisation of HlyC and mechanism of activation and secretion of
haemolysin from E. coli 2001.";
"Fatty acylation of two internal lysine residues required for the
toxic activity of Escherichia coli hemolysin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Bacterial hemolysins are exotoxins that attack blood
    cell membranes and cause cell rupture by mechanisms not clearly
    defined.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The Gly-rich region is probably involved in binding
    calcium, which is required for target cell-binding or cytolytic
    activity.
-!- DOMAIN: The three transmembrane domains are believed to be
    involved in pore formation by the cytotoxin.
-!- PTM: Palmitoylated by hlyC. The toxin only becomes active when
    modified.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The hemolysin of E.coli is produced predominantly
    by strains causing extraintestinal infections, such as those of
    the urinary tract.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RTX prokaryotic toxin (TC 1.C.11)
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 hemolysin-type calcium-binding repeats.
