-!- FUNCTION: Required for proper expression of outer membrane protein
    genes such as ompF, nmpC, protein 2, hemolysin, colicin V, or
    colicin E1. May be specialized for signal sequence independent,
    extracellular secretion in Gram-negative bacteria.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer that assembles to form a continuous, solvent-
    accessible conduit: a 'channel-tunnel' over 140 Angstroms long
    that spans both the outer membrane and periplasmic space. The
    periplasmic or proximal end of the tunnel is sealed by sets of
    coiled helices.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the outer membrane factor (OMF) (TC 1.B.17)
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence was extensively corrected by Ref.1.
