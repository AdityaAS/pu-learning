G protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel 4 (GIRK4)
(Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying subfamily J member 5) (Inward
rectifier K(+) channel Kir3.4) (Heart KATP channel) (KATP-1) (Cardiac
inward rectifier) (CIR).

-!- FUNCTION: This potassium channel is controlled by G proteins.
    Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater
    tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out
    of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration
    of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the
    voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive
    voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage
    of outward current by internal magnesium. Can be blocked by
    external barium.
-!- SUBUNIT: May associate with GIRK1 and GIRK2 to form a G-protein-
    activated heteromultimer pore-forming unit. The resulting inward
    current is much larger (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Islets, exocrine pancreas and heart.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the inward rectifier-type potassium channel
    family.
