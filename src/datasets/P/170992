AC   P0AGA3; P03844;
Preprotein translocase secY subunit.
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export. Interacts with secA and secE
    to allow the translocation of proteins across the plasma membrane,
    by forming part of a channel (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: One of seven secretory proteins (secA-F and secY) that
    comprise the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secY/SEC61-alpha family.
