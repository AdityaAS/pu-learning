Formate dehydrogenase, nitrate-inducible, cytochrome b556(fdn) subunit
(Formate dehydrogenase-N subunit gamma) (FDH-N subunit gamma)
(Anaerobic formate dehydrogenase cytochrome b556 subunit).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";

O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Formate dehydrogenase allows E.coli to use formate as
    major electron donor during anaerobic respiration, when nitrate is
    used as electron acceptor. Subunit gamma is the cytochrome
    b556(FDN) component of the formate dehydrogenase (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 heme groups per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Anaerobic nitrate respiration.
-!- SUBUNIT: Trimer of heterotrimers, consisting of subunits alpha,
    beta and gamma (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the formate dehydrogenase gamma subunit
    family.
