AC   P23900;
Glycerol uptake/efflux facilitator protein.
"A yeast homologue of the bovine lens fibre MIP gene family
complements the growth defect of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant on
fermentable sugars but not its defect in glucose-induced RAS-mediated
cAMP signalling.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XII.";
"Fps1, a yeast member of the MIP family of channel proteins, is a
facilitator for glycerol uptake and efflux and is inactive under
osmotic stress.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
"A global topology map of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Channel protein for glycerol. Has a role in both
    glycerol influx and efflux. Plays a role in osmoregulation: under
    osmotic stress the channel is apparently closed to allow
    accumulation of glycerol in the cell under hyperosmotic
    conditions.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro/Leu-Ala/Ser (NPA).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 907 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
