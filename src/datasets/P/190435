Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM6 (Mitochondrial import-site
protein ISP6) (Translocase of outer membrane 6 kDa subunit).
"Genetic and biochemical characterization of ISP6, a small
mitochondrial outer membrane protein associated with the protein
translocation complex.";

"Multistep assembly of the protein import channel of the mitochondrial
outer membrane.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the TOM (translocase of outer membrane)
    receptor complex responsible for the recognition and translocation
    of cytosolically synthesized mitochondrial preproteins. TOM6 is
    involved in assembly and stability of the TOM complex.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms part of the TOM (translocase of outer membrane)
    complex that consists of at least 7 different proteins (TOM5,
    TOM6, TOM7, TOM20, TOM22, TOM40 and TOM70).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tom6 family.
