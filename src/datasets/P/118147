Outer membrane protein A precursor (Outer membrane protein II*).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the action of colicins K and L and for the
    stabilization of mating aggregates in conjugation. Serves as a
    receptor for a number of T-even like phages. Also acts as a porin
    with low permeability that allows slow penetration of small
    solutes (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ompA family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 OmpA-like domain.
