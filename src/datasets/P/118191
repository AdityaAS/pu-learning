-!- FUNCTION: OmpF is a porin that forms passive diffusion pores which
    allow small molecular weight hydrophilic materials across the
    outer membrane. It is also a receptor for the bacteriophage T2.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Gram-negative porin family.
