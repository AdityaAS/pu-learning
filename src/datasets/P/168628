AC   P55013;
Solute carrier family 12 member 2 (Bumetanide-sensitive sodium-
(potassium)-chloride cotransporter 1) (NA-K-CL symporter) (NKCC).
"Molecular cloning and functional expression of the bumetanide-
sensitive Na-K-Cl cotransporter.";
-!- FUNCTION: Electrically silent transporter system. Mediates sodium
    and chloride reabsorption. Plays a vital role in the regulation of
    ionic balance and cell volume.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in many tissues.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC12A transporter family.
