Calcium-transporting ATPase 8, plasma membrane-type (EC 3.6.3.8)
(Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform 8).
"At-ACA8 encodes a plasma membrane-localized Ca2+-ATPase of
Arabidopsis with a calmodulin-binding domain at the N-terminus.";
"Structural analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 5. X. Sequence

-!- FUNCTION: This magnesium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis
    of ATP coupled with the translocation of calcium from the cytosol
    out of the cell.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Ca(2+)(Cis) = ADP + phosphate +
    Ca(2+)(Trans).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by calmodulin (By similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P62157:CALM (xeno); NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-980643, EBI-397403;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminus contains an autoinhibitory calmodulin-
    binding domain, which binds calmodulin in a calcium-dependent
    fashion.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IIB subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
