AC   P01546;
M1-1 protoxin precursor (Killer toxin K1) [Contains: M1-1 delta chain;
M1-1 alpha chain; M1-1 gamma immunity chain; M1-1 beta chain].
"Sequence of the preprotoxin dsRNA gene of type I killer yeast:
multiple processing events produce a two-component toxin.";
"Cloning and sequencing of the preprotoxin-coding region of the yeast
M1 double-stranded RNA.";
"Cloning, sequencing and expression of a full-length cDNA copy of the
M1 double-stranded RNA virus from the yeast, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae.";
-!- FUNCTION: K1 toxin binds to a cell wall (1->6)-beta-D-glucan and
    then disrupts the cell by creating a pore across the membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: The secreted toxin contains alpha and beta chains that
    are linked by three disulfide bonds. The fates of the gamma and
    delta chains are unknown.
