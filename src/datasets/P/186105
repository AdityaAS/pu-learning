AC   P02982;
Tetracycline resistance protein, class A (TetA(A)).
"Complete nucleotide sequence of Tn1721: gene organization and a novel
gene product with features of a chemotaxis protein.";
"The tetracycline resistance determinants of RP1 and Tn1721:
nucleotide sequence analysis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Resistance to tetracycline by an active tetracycline
    efflux. This is an energy-dependent process that decreases the
    accumulation of the antibiotic in whole cells. This protein
    functions as a metal-tetracycline/H(+) antiporter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. TCR/tet
    family.
