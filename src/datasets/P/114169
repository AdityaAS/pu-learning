Nitrate transport protein nrtA.
"Cloning and characterization of the nrtA gene that encodes a 45-kDa
protein involved in nitrate transport in the cyanobacterium
Synechococcus PCC 7942.";
"Complete sequence of chromosome 1 of Synechococcus elongatus PCC
7942.";
"Identification and characterization of a gene cluster involved in
nitrate transport in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC7942.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential component of the nitrate-transporting system.
    May be the substrate-binding protein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrate, when present in the medium as source of
    nitrogen. Expression is suppressed by ammonium.
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked.
-!- SIMILARITY: To carotenoid-binding protein A (cbpA).
