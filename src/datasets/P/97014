Maltose/maltodextrin import ATP-binding protein malK (EC 3.6.3.19).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex malEFGK involved in
    maltose/maltodextrin import. Responsible for energy coupling to
    the transport system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + maltose(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    maltose(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (malK), two transmembrane proteins (malG and malK) and a solute-
    binding protein (malE) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
    Maltooligosaccharide importer (TC 3.A.1.1.1) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
