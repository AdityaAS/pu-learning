"Characterization of a chimeric proU operon in a subtilin-producing
mutant of Bacillus subtilis 168.";
"Two evolutionarily closely related ABC transporters mediate the
uptake of choline for synthesis of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine
in Bacillus subtilis.";

-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a high affinity multicomponent binding-
    protein-dependent transport system for choline; probably
    responsible for the translocation of the substrate across the
    membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. CysTW subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
