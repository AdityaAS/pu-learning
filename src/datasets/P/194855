-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the uptake of tartrate in exchange to
    the efflux of succinate (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by tartrate, via ttdR.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC13A transporter (TC 2.A.47) family.
    SODIT1 subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (M16194) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 35, 51, 132, 245, 268 and 443.
