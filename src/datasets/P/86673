Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit beta-1 (K(+) channel subunit
beta-1) (Kv-beta-1).
"Inactivation properties of voltage-gated K+ channels altered by
presence of beta-subunit.";
"Differential stimulation of PKC phosphorylation of potassium channels
by ZIP1 and ZIP2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Accessory potassium channel protein which modulates the
    activity of the pore-forming alpha subunit. Alter the functional
    properties of Kv1.1 and Kv1.4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms heteromultimeric complex with alpha subunits.
    Interacts with SQSTM1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Specifically expressed in the nervous system.
-!- DOMAIN: Alteration of functional properties of alpha subunit is
    mediated through N-terminal domain of beta subunit (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the shaker potassium channel beta subunit
    family.
