Multidrug resistance protein ebrA.
"A two-component multidrug efflux pump, EbrAB, in Bacillus subtilis.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a multidrug efflux pump. Confers resistance to
    cationic lipophilic dyes such as ethidium bromide, acriflavine,
    pyronine Y and safranin O. The efflux is probably coupled to an
    influx of protons.
-!- SUBUNIT: The efflux pump is composed of ebrA and ebrB (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small multidrug resistance (SMR)
    protein family. EbrA/ebrB (TC 2.A.7.1.6) subfamily.
Complete proteome; Membrane; Transmembrane; Transport.
