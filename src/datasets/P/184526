AC   P0A4L0; P21131;
Streptolysin O precursor (Thiol-activated cytolysin).
"Nucleotide sequence of the streptolysin O (SLO) gene: structural
homologies between SLO and other membrane-damaging, thiol-activated
toxins.";
"Genome sequence of a serotype M3 strain of group A Streptococcus:
phage-encoded toxins, the high-virulence phenotype, and clone
emergence.";
"Genome sequence of an M3 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes reveals a
large-scale genomic rearrangement in invasive strains and new insights
into phage evolution.";
"The thiol-activated toxin streptolysin O does not require a thiol
group for cytolytic activity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sulfhydryl-activated toxin. Is able to lyse cholesterol
    containing membranes. Can be reversibly inactivated by oxidation.
    Cholesterol is the receptor for the binding of these toxins to
    eukaryotic cell membranes.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the thiol-activated cytolysin family.
