AC   P16869; P77292;
FhuE receptor precursor (Outer-membrane receptor for Fe(III)-coprogen,
Fe(III)-ferrioxamine B and Fe(III)-rhodotrulic acid).
"Sequence of the fhuE outer-membrane receptor gene of Escherichia coli
K12 and properties of mutants.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Ferric-coprogen receptor FhuE of Escherichia coli: processing and
sequence common to all TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor
proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the uptake of Fe(3+) via coprogen,
    ferrioxamine B, and rhodotorulic acid.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane.
-!- INDUCTION: For induction, the tonB and the exbB proteins have to
    be active.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tonB-dependent receptor family.
