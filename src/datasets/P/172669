S-layer protein precursor (Surface layer protein).
"Sequence analysis of the sbsA gene encoding the 130-kDa surface-layer
protein of Bacillus stearothermophilus strain PV72.";
-!- FUNCTION: The S-layer is a paracrystalline mono-layered assembly
    of proteins which coat the surface of bacteria.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell wall. Note=This bacterium is covered by
    a S-layer with hexagonal symmetry.
