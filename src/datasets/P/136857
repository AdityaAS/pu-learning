AC   P42670;
Puromycin resistance protein pur8.
"The pur8 gene from the pur cluster of Streptomyces alboniger encodes
a highly hydrophobic polypeptide which confers resistance to
puromycin.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in active puromycin efflux energized by
    a proton-dependent electrochemical gradient. In addition, it could
    be implicated in secreting N-acetylpuromycin, the last
    intermediate of the puromycin biosynthesis pathway, to the
    environment.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. EmrB
    family.
