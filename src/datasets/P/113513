NADH-quinone oxidoreductase subunit 9 (EC 1.6.99.5) (NADH
dehydrogenase I subunit 9) (NDH-1 subunit 9).
"DNA sequencing of the seven remaining structural genes of the gene
cluster encoding the energy-transducing NADH-quinone oxidoreductase of
Paracoccus denitrificans.";
-!- FUNCTION: NDH-1 shuttles electrons from NADH, via FMN and iron-
    sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the respiratory chain. The
    immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this species is
    believed to be ubiquinone. Couples the redox reaction to proton
    translocation (for every two electrons transferred, four hydrogen
    ions are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus
    conserves the redox energy in a proton gradient.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + quinone = NAD(+) + quinol.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 4Fe-4S clusters per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: NDH-1 is composed of 15 different subunits, nqo1 to
    nqo15. The complex has a L-shaped structure, with the hydrophobic
    arm (subunits nqo7, nqo8 and nqo10 to nqo14) embedded in the
    membrane and the hydrophilic peripheral arm (subunits nqo1 to
    nqo6, nqo9 and nqo15) protruding into the bacterial cytoplasm. The
    hydrophilic domain contains all the redox centers.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I 23 kDa subunit family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
