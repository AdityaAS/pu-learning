AC   P07921;
Lactose permease.
"Primary structure of the lactose permease gene from the yeast
Kluyveromyces lactis. Presence of an unusual transcript structure.";
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: LAC12 mediates the transport of lactose and it would
    appear that the permease works in part by a proton symport
    mechanism.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily. Sugar
    transporter (TC 2.A.1.1) family.
