"The excC gene of Escherichia coli K-12 required for cell envelope
integrity encodes the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL).";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";

-!- SIMILARITY: To P.putida hypothetical protein PP1224 precursor
    (ORF2) (AC P43037).
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (X65796) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 24 and 41.
