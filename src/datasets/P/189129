-!- FUNCTION: Mitochondrial intermembrane chaperone that participates
    in the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins
    into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Also required for the
    transfer of beta-barrel precursors from the TOM complex to the
    sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer
    membrane. Acts as a chaperone-like protein that protects the
    hydrophobic precursors from aggregation and guide them through the
    mitochondrial intermembrane space. Compared to TIM10, it may have
    a strong structural role.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterohexamer; composed of 3 copies of TIM9 and 3 copies
    of TIM10, named soluble 70 kDa complex. Associates with the TIM12
    component of the TIM22 complex, whose core is composed of TIM18,
    TIM22 and TIM54. Interacts with the transmembrane regions of
    multi-pass transmembrane proteins in transit.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    peripheral membrane protein; intermembrane side.
-!- DOMAIN: The twin CX3C motif contains 4 conserved Cys residues that
    form 2 disulfide bonds in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
    However, during the transit of TIM9 from cytoplasm into
    mitochondrion, the Cys residues probably coordinate zinc, thereby
    preventing folding and allowing its transfer across mitochondrial
    outer membrane (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small Tim family.
