AC   Q56992;
Hemin transport system permease protein hmuU.
"The hmu locus of Yersinia pestis is essential for utilization of free
haemin and haem-protein complexes as iron sources.";
"hmuRSTUV of Yersinia pestis encodes an ABC transport system necessary
for hemin utilization.";
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague.";
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis KIM.";
"Complete genome sequence of Yersinia pestis strain 91001, an isolate
avirulent to humans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for hemin; probably responsible for the translocation of the
    substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. FecCD subfamily.
