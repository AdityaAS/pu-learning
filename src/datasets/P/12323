AC   O75185;
Probable calcium-transporting ATPase KIAA0703 (EC 3.6.3.8).
"Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes. X.
The complete sequences of 100 new cDNA clones from brain which can
code for large proteins in vitro.";
-!- FUNCTION: This magnesium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis
    of ATP coupled with the transport of calcium (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Ca(2+)(Cis) = ADP + phosphate +
    Ca(2+)(Trans).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IIA subfamily.
