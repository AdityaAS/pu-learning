AC   P28573;
Sodium-dependent proline transporter (Solute carrier family 6 member
7).
"Molecular cloning and expression of a high affinity L-proline
transporter expressed in putative glutamatergic pathways of rat
brain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Terminates the action of proline by its high affinity
    sodium-dependent reuptake into presynaptic terminals.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in subpopulations of putative
    glutamatergic pathways of rat brain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
