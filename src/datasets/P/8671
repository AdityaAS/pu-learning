"High-affinity L-arabinose transport operon. Nucleotide sequence and
analysis of gene products.";
"A 460-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 40.1-50.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains

-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex araFGH involved in
    arabinose import. Responsible for energy coupling to the transport
    system (Probable).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + monosaccharide(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + monosaccharide(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (araG), two transmembrane proteins (araH) and a solute-binding
    protein (araF) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Arabinose
    importer (TC 3.A.1.2.2) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
