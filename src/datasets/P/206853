O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably involved in the export of the extracellular
    polysaccharide colanic acid from the cell to medium (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bexD/ctrA/vexA family.
