-!- FUNCTION: Probably involved in connections of major cytoskeletal
    structures to the plasma membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with SLC9A3R1 and PACE1. Interacts with MPP5
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane (By similarity). Note=Localization
    to the apical membrane of parietal cells depends on the
    interaction with MPP5. Microvillar peripheral membrane protein
    (cytoplasmic side). Localizes to cell extensions and peripheral
    processes of astrocytes (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in cerebrum and cerebellum (at
    protein level). Component of the microvilli of intestinal
    epithelial cells.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Detected in whole embryo from E5 with highest
    expression at E8, E11, E12, and E18. Expressed at E18 in brain, a
    clear reduction occurs after birth followed by a transient
    increase around 2 weeks to 1 month. Hardly detected in adult
    brain.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by tyrosine-protein kinases.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 FERM domain.
