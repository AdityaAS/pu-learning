AC   P39570;
Spore germination protein B2.
"The gerB region of the Bacillus subtilis 168 chromosome encodes a
homologue of the gerA spore germination operon.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the response to the germinative mixture of
    L-asparagine, glucose, fructose and potassium ions (AGFK). Could
    be an amino acid transporter. Cannot stimulate germination in the
    absence of gerD and gerK gene products (fructose and glucose
    receptors, respectively).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed in the forespore compartment of the
    developing sporangium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
    superfamily. Spore germination protein (SGP) (TC 2.A.3.9) family.
