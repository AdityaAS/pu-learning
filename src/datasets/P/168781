AC   O54699;
Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (Equilibrative
nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside-insensitive nucleoside transporter)
(Equilibrative NBMPR-insensitive nucleoside transporter) (Nucleoside
transporter, ei-type) (Solute carrier family 29 member 2).
"Molecular cloning and functional characterization of
nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-sensitive (es) and NBMPR-insensitive
(ei) equilibrative nucleoside transporter proteins (rENT1 and rENT2)
from rat tissues.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates both influx and efflux of nucleosides across
    the membrane (equilibrative transporter). It is insensitive (EI)
    to low concentrations of the inhibitor nitrobenzylmercaptopurine
    riboside (NBMPR) and is sodium-independent. Specific for
    nucleosides, but may also transport hypoxanthine. May also play a
    role in the efflux of inosine and hypoxanthine from muscle cells
    during the net degradation of purine nucleotides that occurs
    during strenuous exercise and/or in the reuptake of these purines
    during the recovery process (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Resistant to dipyridamole and dilazep inhibition
    (anticancer chemotherapeutics drugs).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC29A transporter family.
