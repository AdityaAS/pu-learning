AC   O16137;
Defensin-2 precursor.
"Midgut-specific immune molecules are produced by the blood-sucking
insect Stomoxys calcitrans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Antibacterial peptide active mostly against Gram-
    negative bacteria. Its activity is enhanced by lipopolysaccharide.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Constitutively expressed in the anterior
    midgut and is up-regulated by blood feeding. Not expressed in the
    fat body or hemocytes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the invertebrate defensin family. Type 1
    subfamily.
