AC   Q4P9R2;
UDP-galactose transporter homolog 1.
"Insights from the genome of the biotrophic fungal plant pathogen
Ustilago maydis.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in specific transport of UDP-Gal from
    the cytosol to the Golgi lumen. Involved in the maintenance of
    optimal conditions for the folding of secretory pathway proteins
    in the endoplasmic reticulum (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nucleotide-sugar transporter family.
    SLC35B subfamily.
