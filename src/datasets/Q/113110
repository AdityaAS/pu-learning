AC   Q9WV87;
NADPH oxidase homolog 1 (NOX-1) (NOH-1) (NADH/NADPH mitogenic oxidase
subunit P65-MOX) (Mitogenic oxidase 1) (MOX1).
"Cell transformation by the superoxide-generating oxidase Mox1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Pyridine nucleotide-dependent oxidoreductase that
    generates superoxide and might conduct H(+) ions as part of its
    electron transport mechanism.
-!- COFACTOR: NADP (Potential).
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (Potential).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: The oxidase activity is potentiated by NOXO1
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with NOXO1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ferric oxidoreductase domain.
