AC   Q83RN5;
Respiratory nitrate reductase 1 beta chain (EC 1.7.99.4).

through comparison with genomes of Escherichia coli K12 and O157.";

flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: The nitrate reductase enzyme complex allows S.flexneri
    to use nitrate as an electron acceptor during anaerobic growth.
    The beta chain is an electron transfer unit containing four
    cysteine clusters involved in the formation of iron-sulfur
    centers. Electrons are transferred from the gamma chain to the
    molybdenum cofactor of the alpha subunit (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nitrite + acceptor = nitrate + reduced
    acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 3 4Fe-4S clusters per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 3Fe-4S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer of heterotrimers each composed of an alpha, a beta
    and a gamma chain. Alpha and beta are catalytic chains; gamma
    chains are involved in binding the enzyme complex to the
    cytoplasmic membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
