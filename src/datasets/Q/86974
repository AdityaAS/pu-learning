AC   Q8QFV0;
Potassium channel subfamily T member 1 (Sequence-like a calcium-
activated potassium channel subunit).
"Cloning and characterization of potassium channel subunit (slack)
from chick brain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Generates outwardly rectifying currents that are
    suppressed by elevation of intracellular calcium (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family. Calcium-
    activated subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RCK N-terminal domain.
