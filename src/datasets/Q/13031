AC   Q8PPC8;
Potassium-transporting ATPase C chain (EC 3.6.3.12) (Potassium-
translocating ATPase C chain) (ATP phosphohydrolase [potassium-
transporting] C chain) (Potassium-binding and translocating subunit
C).
"Comparison of the genomes of two Xanthomonas pathogens with differing
host specificities.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the components of the high-affinity ATP-driven
    potassium transport (or KDP) system, which catalyzes the
    hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of hydrogen and
    potassium ions. The C subunit may be involved in assembly of the
    KDP complex (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + K(+)(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    K(+)(In).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the kdpC family.
