AC   Q54337; Q9S3T8;
Accessory gene regulator protein B (EC 3.4.-.-).
"Agr-related sequences in Staphylococcus lugdunensis.";
"Full agr-sl sequence of Staphylococcus lugdunensis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential for the production of a quorum sensing system
    signal molecule, the autoinducing peptide (AIP). This quorum
    sensing system is responsible for the regulation of the expression
    of virulence factor genes. Involved in the proteolytic processing
    of agrD, the precursor of AIP (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the agrB family.
