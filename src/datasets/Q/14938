AC   P15015;
ATP synthase B' chain (EC 3.6.3.14) (Subunit II).
"DNA sequence of a gene cluster coding for subunits of the F0 membrane
sector of ATP synthase in Rhodospirillum rubrum. Support for modular
evolution of the F1 and F0 sectors.";
-!- FUNCTION: The b'-subunit is a diverged and duplicated form of b
    found in plants and photosynthetic bacteria.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: This is one of the chains of the nonenzymatic component
    (CF(0) subunit) of the ATPase complex.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase B chain family.
