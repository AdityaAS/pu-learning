AC   Q8DLG7;
ATP synthase epsilon chain (EC 3.6.3.14) (ATP synthase F1 sector
epsilon subunit).
"Complete genome structure of the thermophilic cyanobacterium
Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton
    gradient across the membrane.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cellular thylakoid membrane; peripheral
    membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase epsilon chain family.
