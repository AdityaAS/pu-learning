AC   Q56983; Q66CR6;
Outer membrane usher protein psaC precursor.
"The psa locus is responsible for thermoinducible binding of Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis to cultured cells.";
"Insights into the evolution of Yersinia pestis through whole-genome
comparison with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the export and assembly of psaA (pH 6)
    fimbrial subunits across the outer membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fimbrial export usher family.
