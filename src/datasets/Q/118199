AC   O54340;
Major outer membrane protein precursor (MOMP) (Outer membrane protein
H).
-!- FUNCTION: Structural rigidity of the outer membrane of elementary
    bodies and porin forming, permitting diffusion of solutes through
    the intracellular reticulate body membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Disulfide bond interactions within and between MOMP
    molecules and other components form high molecular-weight
    oligomers (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
