AC   Q9M1K3;
Probable aquaporin SIP2.1 (Small basic intrinsic protein 2.1).
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 3 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
"Full-length cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana.";
"From genome to function: the Arabidopsis aquaporins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Aquaporins facilitate the transport of water and small
    neutral solutes across cell membranes (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in roots.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala/Leu (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family. SIP
    subfamily.
