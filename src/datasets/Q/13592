AC   P69420; P05717;
ATP synthase protein 9, mitochondrial (EC 3.6.3.14) (Lipid-binding
protein).
"The pea mitochondrial ATPase subunit 9 gene is located upstream of
the ATPase alpha-subunit gene.";
"Transcript map of oppositely oriented pea mitochondrial genes
encoding the alpha-subunit and the subunit 9 of F1F0-ATPase complex.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is one of the chains of the nonenzymatic
    membrane component (F0) of mitochondrial ATPase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase C chain family.
