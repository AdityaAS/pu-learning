Phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.3.9)
(Phosphotransferase system, enzyme I).
"Complete genome sequence of a multiple drug resistant Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi CT18.";
"Comparative genomics of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi strains Ty2
and CT18.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent
    sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system. Enzyme I transfers the phosphoryl group from
    phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the phosphoryl carrier protein (HPr).
    Enzyme I is common to all PTS (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphoenolpyruvate + protein L-histidine =
    pyruvate + protein N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PEP-utilizing enzyme family.
-!- CAUTION: In strain CT18 it seems to be a pseudogene. It is
    interrupted by a frameshift in position 353. The sequence has been
    verified by the authors and is believed to be correct.
