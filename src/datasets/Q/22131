AC   Q9ZCF9;
Cytochrome c biogenesis ATP-binding export protein ccmA (EC 3.6.3.41)
(Heme exporter protein A).
"The genome sequence of Rickettsia prowazekii and the origin of
mitochondria.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex ccmAB involved in
    the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes; once thought to export heme,
    this seems not to be the case, but its exact role is uncertain.
    Responsible for energy coupling to the transport system (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + heme(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    heme(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (ccmA) and two transmembrane proteins (ccmB) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. CcmA exporter
    (TC 3.A.1.107) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
