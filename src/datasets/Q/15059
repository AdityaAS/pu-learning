AC   P37385; Q31KS2;
Probable copper-transporting ATPase synA (EC 3.6.3.4).
"P-type ATPase from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus 7942 related to
the human Menkes and Wilson disease gene products.";
"Complete sequence of chromosome 1 of Synechococcus elongatus PCC
7942.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in copper transport.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Cu(2+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    Cu(2+)(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HMA domain.
