AC   O22588;
Probable aquaporin TIP3.2 (Tonoplast intrinsic protein 3.2) (Beta-
tonoplast intrinsic protein) (Beta-TIP).
"Regulation of Arabidopsis Beta-TIP in etiolated seedlings.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"From genome to function: the Arabidopsis aquaporins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Aquaporins facilitate the transport of water and small
    neutral solutes across cell membranes (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein (By similarity). Note=Tonoplast.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=1;
      Comment=A number of isoforms are produced. According to EST
      sequences;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=O22588-1; Sequence=Displayed;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominantly expressed in developing seeds.
    Also expressed in rosette leaves.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family. TIP
    subfamily.
