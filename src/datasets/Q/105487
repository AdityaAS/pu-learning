AC   Q9M2P2;
Putative metal tolerance protein C3 (AtMTPc3).
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 3 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Phylogenetic relationships within cation transporter families of
Arabidopsis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in sequestration of excess metal in the
    cytoplasm into vacuoles to maintain metal homeostasis (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein (By similarity). Note=Tonoplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)
    transporter (TC 2.A.4) family.
