AC   P0C197; Q4P8S3;
Probable chloride channel protein UM03490-D.
"Insights from the genome of the biotrophic fungal plant pathogen
Ustilago maydis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Voltage-gated chloride channel (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chloride channel (TC 1.A.11) family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CBS domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction. The predicted gene UM03490 has been split
    into 4 genes: UM03490-A, UM03490-B, UM03490-C and UM03490-D.
Membrane; Transmembrane.
