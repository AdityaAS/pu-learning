Annexin A4 (Annexin IV) (Lipocortin IV) (Endonexin I) (Chromobindin-4)
(Protein II) (P32.5) (Placental anticoagulant protein I) (PAP-II)
(PP4-X) (35-beta calcimedin).
"The amino acid sequence of protein II and its phosphorylation site
for protein kinase C; the domain structure Ca2+-modulated lipid
binding proteins.";
"Evaluation and characterization of a porcine small intestine cDNA
library: analysis of 839 clones.";
-!- FUNCTION: Calcium/phospholipid-binding protein which promotes
    membrane fusion and is involved in exocytosis (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- DOMAIN: A pair of annexin repeats may form one binding site for
    calcium and phospholipid.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Seems to bind one calcium ion with high affinity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the annexin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 annexin repeats.
