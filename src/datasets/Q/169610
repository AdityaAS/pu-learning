"Proteomics of the venom from the Amazonian scorpion Tityus cambridgei
and the role of prolines on mass spectrometry analysis of toxins.";
"Scorpion toxins from Tityus cambridgei that affect Na(+)-channels.";
-!- FUNCTION: Affects the tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium current
    permeability of F-11 rat neuroblastoma cells. Produces a dose
    dependent increase in amplitude and duration of the current.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=7310; METHOD=Electrospray; RANGE=1-65;
    NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=7318.3; METHOD=Electrospray; RANGE=1-65;
    NOTE=Ref.2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the long (4 C-C) scorpion toxin
    superfamily. Sodium channel inhibitor family.
