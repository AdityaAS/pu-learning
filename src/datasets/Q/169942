AC   Q95165;
Amiloride-sensitive sodium channel subunit beta (Epithelial Na+
channel subunit beta) (Beta ENaC) (Nonvoltage-gated sodium channel 1
subunit beta) (SCNEB) (Beta NaCH) (Fragment).
"An AvaII PCR/RFLP in an exon of the canine gene for the beta subunit
of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (SCNN1B).";
-!- FUNCTION: Sodium permeable non-voltage-sensitive ion channel
    inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Mediates the electrodiffusion
    of the luminal sodium (and water, which follows osmotically)
    through the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Controls the
    reabsorption of sodium in kidney, colon, lung and sweat glands.
    Also plays a role in taste perception (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer of two alpha, one beta and one gamma
    subunit. A delta subunit can replace the alpha subunit. Interacts
    with the WW domains of NEDD4, NEDD4L, WWP1 and WWP2 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; apical cell membrane; multi-
    pass membrane protein (By similarity). Note=Apical membrane of
    epithelial cells (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel
    family.
