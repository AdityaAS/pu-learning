-!- FUNCTION: Putative hyperpolarization-activated ion channel
    exhibiting weak selectivity for potassium over sodium ions (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The potassium channel is probably composed of a homo- or
    heterotetrameric complex of pore-forming subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The segment S4 is probably the voltage-sensor and is
    characterized by a series of positively charged amino acids at
    every third position.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family. HCN
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 cyclic nucleotide-binding domain.
