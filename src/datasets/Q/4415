AC   Q6QRN9;
ADP/ATP translocase 3 (Adenine nucleotide translocator 2) (ANT 3)
(ADP,ATP carrier protein 3) (Solute carrier family 25 member 6).
"Identification of differentially expressed genes in porcine
embryos.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the exchange of ADP and ATP across the
    mitochondrial inner membrane. May participate in the formation of
    the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) responsible for
    the release of mitochondrial products that triggers apoptosis (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The transmembrane helices are not perpendicular to
    the plane of the membrane, but cross the membrane at an angle.
    Odd-numbered transmembrane helices exhibit a sharp kink, due to
    the presence of a conserved proline residue (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
