"Purification and characterisation of proteins with cardiac
stimulatory and haemolytic activity from the anemone Actinia
tenebrosa.";
-!- FUNCTION: This cardiac stimulatory and hemolytic pore-forming
    protein forms cations-selective hydrophilic pores of around 1 nm.
    Pore formation proceeds by membrane binding via a surface rich in
    aromatic residues, followed by translocation of the N-terminal
    region to the membrane and, finally, across the bilayer to form a
    functional pore.
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer in the presence of a lipidic interface. Monomer,
    in soluble state (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein. Note=Found in nematocyst.
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal region, before the pore is formed, is bound
    to the lipid membrane. It partitions into the lipid-water
    interface and stabilizes the monomeric molecule on the membrane.
    Finally, it traverses the bilayer, thus forming the transmembrane
    pore (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The Trp-rich region is important for the binding to lipid
    membrane (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sea anemone actinoporin family.
