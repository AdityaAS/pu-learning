Dipeptide transport system permease protein dppC.
"The dipeptide permease of Escherichia coli closely resembles other
bacterial transport systems and shows growth-phase-dependent
expression.";
"Analysis of the Escherichia coli genome. V. DNA sequence of the
region from 76.0 to 81.5 minutes.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane
proteome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for dipeptides; probably responsible for the translocation of the
    substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. OppBC subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
