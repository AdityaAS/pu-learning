Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel protein 3 (SK3).
"Small-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels from
mammalian brain.";
"SK3 is an important component of K(+) channels mediating the
afterhyperpolarization in cultured rat SCG neurones.";
"Cloning and functional expression of a liver isoform of the small
conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel SK3.";
-!- FUNCTION: Forms a voltage-independent potassium channel activated
    by intracellular calcium. Activation is followed by membrane
    hyperpolarization. Thought to regulate neuronal excitability by
    contributing to the slow component of synaptic
    afterhyperpolarization. The channel is blocked by apamin.
-!- SUBUNIT: Hetero-oligomer. The complex is composed of 4 channel
    subunits each of which binds to a calmodulin subunit which
    regulates the channel activity through calcium-binding (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel KCNN family.
