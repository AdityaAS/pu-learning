AC   Q9C8E7;
Glutamate receptor 3.3 precursor (Ligand-gated ion channel 3.3).
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Phylogenetic and expression analysis of the glutamate-receptor-like
gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana.";
-!- FUNCTION: Glutamate-gated receptor that probably acts as non-
    selective cation channel. May be involved in light-signal
    transduction and calcium homeostasis via the regulation of calcium
    influx into cells.
-!- SUBUNIT: May form heteromers (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed predominantly in roots and siliques.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glutamate-gated ion channel (TC 1.A.10)
    family.
