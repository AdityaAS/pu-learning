AC   Q6CZZ8;
Large-conductance mechanosensitive channel.
"Genome sequence of the enterobacterial phytopathogen Erwinia
carotovora subsp. atroseptica and characterization of virulence
factors.";
-!- FUNCTION: Channel that opens in response to stretch forces in the
    membrane lipid bilayer. May participate in the regulation of
    osmotic pressure changes within the cell (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homopentamer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mscL family.
