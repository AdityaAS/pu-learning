AC   P52591;
Nuclear envelope pore membrane protein POM 121 (Pore membrane protein
of 121 kDa) (P145).
"An integral membrane protein of the pore membrane domain of the
nuclear envelope contains a nucleoporin-like region.";
"Nuclear pore complexes form immobile networks and have a very low
turnover in live mammalian cells.";
"Correlation between nucleocytoplasmic transport and caspase-3-
dependent dismantling of nuclear pores during apoptosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC).
    The repeat-containing domain may be involved in anchoring
    components of the pore complex to the pore membrane. When
    overexpressed in cells induces the formation of cytoplasmic
    annulate lamellae (AL).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nuclear pore complex; single-pass
    type II membrane protein. Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic
    reticulum membrane; single-pass type II membrane protein.
    Note=Stably associated with the NPC throughout interphase and the
    endoplasmic reticulum during metaphase.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains F-X-F-G repeats.
-!- PTM: Proteolytically cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis.
