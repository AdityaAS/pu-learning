-!- FUNCTION: Crucial in the assembly, expression, and functional
    modulation of the heterotrimeric complex of the sodium channel.
    The subunit beta-2 causes an increase in the plasma membrane
    surface area and in its folding into microvilli. Interacts with
    TNR may play a crucial role in clustering and regulation of
    activity of sodium channels at nodes of Ranvier (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The sodium channel consists of a pore-forming alpha
    subunit, beta-1 and beta-2 subunits. Beta-1 is non-covalently
    associated with alpha, while beta-2 is covalently linked by
    disulfide bonds. Interaction with SCN10A and TNR (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain specific.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
