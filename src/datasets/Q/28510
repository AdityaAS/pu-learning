AC   P06683; Q91XA7;
Complement component C9 precursor.
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Topological mapping of complement component C9 by recombinant DNA
techniques suggests a novel mechanism for its insertion into target
membranes.";
"Proteome-wide characterization of N-glycosylation events by diagonal
chromatography.";
-!- FUNCTION: C9 is the final component of the complement system to be
    added in the assembly of the membrane attack complex. It is able
    to enter lipid bilayers, forming transmembrane channels.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complement C6/C7/C8/C9 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 EGF-like domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 LDL-receptor class A domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 MACPF domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 TSP type-1 domain.
