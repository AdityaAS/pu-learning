AC   P38377;
Protein transport protein Sec61 subunit alpha isoform 1 (Sec61 alpha-
1).
"A mammalian homolog of SEC61p and SECYp is associated with ribosomes
and nascent polypeptides during translocation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a crucial role in the insertion of secretory and
    membrane polypeptides into the ER. Required for assembly of
    membrane and secretory proteins. Tightly associated with membrane-
    bound ribosomes, either directly or through adaptor proteins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimeric complex composed of SEC61-alpha, SEC61-
    beta and SEC61-gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secY/SEC61-alpha family.
