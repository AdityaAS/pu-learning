AC   Q37601;
ATP synthase a chain (EC 3.6.3.14) (ATPase protein 6).
"Characterisation of the cox3, nad7 and atp6 genes from the
mitochondrial genome of the brown alga Pylaiella littoralis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Key component of the proton channel; it may play a
    direct role in the translocation of protons across the membrane.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase A chain family.
