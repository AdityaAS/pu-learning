AC   Q89AA3;
Ubiquinol oxidase subunit 2 precursor (EC 1.10.3.-) (Ubiquinol oxidase
polypeptide II) (Cytochrome o subunit 2) (Oxidase BO(3) subunit 2)
(Cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit 2).
"Reductive genome evolution in Buchnera aphidicola.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex is the component
    of the aerobic respiratory chain that predominates when cells are
    grown at high aeration (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Ubiquinol-8 + O(2) = Ubiquinone-8 + H(2)O.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 family.
