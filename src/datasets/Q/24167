regulator anion-transporting activities by Shank2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the transport of chloride ions. May regulate
    bicarbonate secretion and salvage in epithelial cells by
    regulating the SLC4A7 transporter.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with MYO6, SLC9A3R1 and GOPC. Interacts with
    SLC4A7 through SLC9A3R1 (By similarity). Interacts with SHANK2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. CFTR
    transporter (TC 3.A.1.202) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
