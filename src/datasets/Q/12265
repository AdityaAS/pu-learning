AC   P14415; O60444;
Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-2 (Sodium/potassium-
dependent ATPase beta-2 subunit).
"Identification of a putative isoform of the Na,K-ATPase beta subunit.
Primary structure and tissue-specific expression.";
"Nucleotide sequence of a cDNA for the beta 2 subunit isoform of
Na+,K(+)-ATPase from human retina.";
"Expression and synthesis of the Na,K-ATPase beta 2 subunit in human
retinal pigment epithelium.";
"Structure and expression of the human Na,K-ATPase beta 2-subunit
gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is the non-catalytic component of the active
    enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the
    exchange of Na(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane. The
    exact function of the beta-2 subunit is not known.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of three subunits: alpha (catalytic), beta and
    gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Na+/K+ and H+/K+ ATPases subunit beta
    family.
