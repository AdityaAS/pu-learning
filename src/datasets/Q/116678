AC   Q9ZCG3;
NADH-quinone oxidoreductase chain J (EC 1.6.99.5) (NADH dehydrogenase
I, chain J) (NDH-1, chain J).
"The genome sequence of Rickettsia prowazekii and the origin of
mitochondria.";
-!- FUNCTION: NDH-1 shuttles electrons from NADH, via FMN and iron-
    sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the respiratory chain.
    Couples the redox reaction to proton translocation (for every two
    electrons transferred, four hydrogen ions are translocated across
    the cytoplasmic membrane), and thus conserves the redox energy in
    a proton gradient (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + quinone = NAD(+) + quinol.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I subunit 6 family.
