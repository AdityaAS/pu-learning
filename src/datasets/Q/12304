Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 3 (EC 3.6.3.8)
(Calcium pump 3) (SERCA3) (SR Ca(2+)-ATPase 3) (Fragment).
"SERCA pump isoform expression in endothelium of veins and arteries:
every endothelium is not the same.";
-!- FUNCTION: This magnesium-dependent enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis
    of ATP coupled with the transport of the calcium. Transports
    calcium ions from the cytosol into the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic
    reticulum lumen. Contributes to calcium sequestration involved in
    muscular excitation/contraction.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + Ca(2+)(Cis) = ADP + phosphate +
    Ca(2+)(Trans).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity). Nucleus;
    nuclear membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in endothelial tissues.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IIA subfamily.
