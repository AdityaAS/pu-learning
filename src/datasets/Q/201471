AC   O97755;
Vacuolar ATP synthase subunit D (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-ATPase D subunit)
(Vacuolar proton pump D subunit) (V-ATPase 28 kDa accessory protein).
"The rabbit vacuolar proton-ATPase Subunit D: alternative splicing and
high expression in osteoclasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Subunit of the peripheral V1 complex of vacuolar ATPase.
    Vacuolar ATPase is responsible for acidifying a variety of
    intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells, thus providing
    most of the energy required for transport processes in the
    vacuolar system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (components A to H) attached to an
    integral membrane V0 proton pore complex (components: a, c, c',
    c'' and d).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase D subunit family.
