AC   P82271;
Rhesus theta defensin-1/2, subunit B precursor (RTD-1b) (RTD-1 subunit
B) (RTD-2) (Demidefensin-1).
"A cyclic antimicrobial peptide produced in primate leukocytes by the
ligation of two truncated alpha-defensins.";
"Circular minidefensins and posttranslational generation of molecular
diversity.";
"Homodimeric theta-defensins from rhesus macaque leukocytes:
isolation, synthesis, antimicrobial activities, and bacterial binding
properties of the cyclic peptides.";
-!- FUNCTION: RTD-1 and RTD-2 have similar antimicrobial activities
    against the Gram-positive bacteria S.aureus 502A and
    L.monocytogenes, the Gram-negative bacterium S.typhimurium, and
    the fungi C.albicans 16820 and C.neoformans 271A. RTD-2 is 2-3-
    fold less active than RTD-1 against E.coli ML35.
-!- SUBUNIT: RTD-1 is a cyclic heterodimer composed of subunits A and
    B; disulfide-linked. RTD-2 is a cyclic homodimer composed of two
    subunits B; disulfide-linked.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: RTD-1 is expressed in bone marrow. Detected in
    promyelocytes, myelocytes and mature neutrophils and monocytes.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: RTD-1 expression begins early during
    granulocyte myelopoiesis.
-!- PTM: Forms a cyclic peptide with 1 subunit B (RTD-2) or with 1
    subunit A (RTD-1). An additional intersubunit disulfide bond is
    formed.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2083.0; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=65-73; NOTE=RTD-
    1, heterodimer, cyclized and oxidized (Ref.3).
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2087.9; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=65-73; NOTE=RTD-
    2, homodimer, cyclized and oxidized (Ref.3).
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2087.70; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=65-73;
    NOTE=RTD-1, heterodimer and reduced (Ref.2).
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2094.89; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=65-73;
    NOTE=RTD-2, homodimer and reduced (Ref.2).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: RTD-1 is 10-fold more present in cells than RTD-2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the alpha-defensin family. Theta subfamily.
