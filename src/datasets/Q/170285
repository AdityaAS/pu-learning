-!- FUNCTION: Binds to sodium channels and inhibits the inactivation
    of the activated channels, thereby blocking neuronal transmission.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the long (4 C-C) scorpion toxin
    superfamily. Sodium channel inhibitor family. Beta subfamily.
