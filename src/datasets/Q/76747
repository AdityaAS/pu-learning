Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1B (HSP70.2).
"Partial and complete sequences of bovine HSP70-1 and HSP70-2 genes.";
"Deletion of one of the duplicated Hsp70 genes causes hereditary
myopathy of diaphragmatic muscles in Holstein-Friesian cattle.";
"Heat-shock promoter-driven synthesis of secreted bovine herpesvirus
glycoproteins in transfected cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: In cooperation with other chaperones, Hsp70s stabilize
    preexistent proteins against aggregation and mediate the folding
    of newly translated polypeptides in the cytosol as well as within
    organelles. These chaperones participate in all these processes
    through their ability to recognize nonnative conformations of
    other proteins. They bind extended peptide segments with a net
    hydrophobic character exposed by polypeptides during translation
    and membrane translocation, or following stress-induced damage (By
    similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By heat shock.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family.
ATP-binding; Chaperone; Heat shock; Nucleotide-binding.
