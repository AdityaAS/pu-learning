-!- FUNCTION: Electroneutral sodium- and bicarbonate-dependent
    cotransporter with a Na(+):HCO3(-) 1:1 stoichiometry. Regulates
    intracellular pH and may play a role in bicarbonate salvage in
    secretory epithelia. May also have an associated sodium channel
    activity.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Transporter activity is regulated by
    CA2/carbonic anhydrase 2, cAMP and PKA. Insensitive to stilbene
    derivatives. May be inhibited by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride
    (EIPA) (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a complex with ATP6V1B1 and SLC9A3R1/EBP50.
    Interacts in a pH dependent-manner with CA2/carbonic anhydrase 2
    (By similarity). Interacts with CFTR through SLC9A3R1/EBP50.
    Interacts with USH1C.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; basolateral cell membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein. Note=Also described at the apical
    cell membrane. Localizes to the stereocilia of cochlear outer hair
    cells and to the lateral membrane of cochlear inner hair cells (By
    similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q8BTY2-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q8BTY2-2; Sequence=VSP_017166, VSP_017167, VSP_017168;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the spiral ligament throughout
    the cochlea and in photoreceptors of the outer plexiform layer of
    the retina (at protein level).
-!- DOMAIN: The PDZ-binding motif mediates interaction with the CFTR,
    SLC9A3R1/EBP50 complex and probably with USH1C (By similarity).
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Mice lacking Slc4a7 display deafness and blindness
    due to degeneration of sensory receptors in internal ear and
    retina.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the anion exchanger (TC 2.A.31) family.
