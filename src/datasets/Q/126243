AC   Q74LQ3;
Phosphonates import ATP-binding protein phnC (EC 3.6.3.28).
"The genome sequence of the probiotic intestinal bacterium
Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex phnCDE involved in
    phosphonates import. Responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + phosphonate(Out) = ADP +
    phosphate + phosphonate(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (phnC), two transmembrane proteins (phnE) and a solute-binding
    protein (phnD) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Phosphonates
    importer (TC 3.A.1.9.1) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
