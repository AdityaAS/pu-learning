AC   Q5HHR7;
Preprotein translocase secA subunit.
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export. Interacts with the secY/secE
    subunits. SecA has a central role in coupling the hydrolysis of
    ATP to the transfer of pre-secretory proteins across the membrane
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus
    which comprise secA, secB, secD, secE, secF, secG and secY (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein;
    cytoplasmic side (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secA family.
ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Membrane; Nucleotide-binding;
