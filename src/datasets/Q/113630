Na(+)-translocating NADH-quinone reductase subunit F (EC 1.6.5.-)
(Na(+)-translocating NQR subunit F) (Na(+)-NQR subunit F) (NQR complex
subunit F) (NQR-1 subunit F).
"Effects of changes in membrane sodium flux on virulence gene
expression in Vibrio cholerae.";
"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
-!- FUNCTION: NQR complex catalyzes the reduction of ubiquinone-1 to
    ubiquinol by two successive reactions, coupled with the transport
    of Na(+) ions from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. The first step
    is catalyzed by nqrF, which accepts electrons from NADH and
    reduces ubiquinone-1 to ubisemiquinone by a one-electron transfer
    pathway.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone + Na(+)(In) = NAD(+) +
    ubiquinol + Na(+)(Out).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of six subunits; nqrA, nqrB, nqrC, nqrD, nqrE
    and nqrF (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nqrF family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain.
