Manganese ABC transporter substrate-binding lipoprotein precursor
(Pneumococcal surface adhesin A).
"Identification of a psaA gene in viridans streptococcal strains.";
"Genome of the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae strain R6.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of an ATP-driven transport system for manganese.
    Also act as an adhesin which is involved on adherence to
    extracellular matrix. It is an important factor in pathogenesis
    and infection (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 9
    family. Lipoprotein receptor antigen (Lrai) subfamily.
