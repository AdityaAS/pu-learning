AC   Q6CZB5;
Vitamin B12 transporter btuB precursor (Cobalamin receptor) (Outer
membrane cobalamin translocator).
"Genome sequence of the enterobacterial phytopathogen Erwinia
carotovora subsp. atroseptica and characterization of virulence
factors.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the active translocation of vitamin B12
    (cyanocobalamin) across the outer membrane to the periplasmic
    space. It derives its energy for transport by interacting with the
    trans-periplasmic membrane protein tonB (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tonB-dependent receptor family. BtuB
    (TC 1.B.14.3.1) subfamily.
