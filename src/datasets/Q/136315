PTS system N-acetylmuramic acid-specific EIIBC component (EIIBC-
MurNAc) [Includes: N-acetylmuramic acid-specific phosphotransferase
enzyme IIB component (EC 2.7.1.69) (PTS system N-acetylmuramic acid-
specific EIIB component); N-acetylmuramic acid permease IIC component
(PTS system N-acetylmuramic acid-specific EIIC component)].

agents of bacillary dysentery.";
-!- FUNCTION: The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar
    phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system, catalyzes the phosphorylation of incoming sugar
    substrates concomitant with their translocation across the cell
    membrane. This system is involved in N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc)
    transport, yielding cytoplasmic MurNAc-6-P. Is also able to take
    up anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (anhMurNAc), but cannot
    phosphorylate the carbon 6, probably because of the 1,6-anhydro
    ring (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein EIIB N(pi)-phospho-L-
    histidine/cysteine + sugar = protein EIIB + sugar phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIB domain is phosphorylated by phospho-EIIA on a
    cysteinyl or histidyl residue, depending on the transported sugar.
    Then, it transfers the phosphoryl group to the sugar substrate
    concomitantly with the sugar uptake processed by the EIIC domain.
-!- DOMAIN: The EIIC domain forms the PTS system translocation channel
    and contains the specific substrate-binding site.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIB type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PTS EIIC type-1 domain.
