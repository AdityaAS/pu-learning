Potassium channel toxin kappa-KTx 1.1 (Kappa-hefutoxin-1) (Kappa-
HfTx1).
"Kappa-hefutoxin1, a novel toxin from the scorpion Heterometrus
fulvipes with unique structure and function. Importance of the
functional diad in potassium channel selectivity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Slows the activation kinetics of Kv1.3 currents, and
    blocks Kv1.3 and Kv1.2 potassium channels. This block is dose-
    dependent, voltage-independent, and reversible. Has no effect on
    Kv1.1 currents.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=2655.4; MW_ERR=0.2; METHOD=Electrospray;
    RANGE=1-22; NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the short scorpion toxin superfamily.
    Potassium channel inhibitor kappa-KTx family. Kappa-KTx 1
    subfamily.
