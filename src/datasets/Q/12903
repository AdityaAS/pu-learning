AC   Q74AB0;
Potassium-transporting ATPase A chain (EC 3.6.3.12) (Potassium-
translocating ATPase A chain) (ATP phosphohydrolase [potassium-
transporting] A chain) (Potassium-binding and translocating subunit
A).
"Genome of Geobacter sulfurreducens: metal reduction in subsurface
environments.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the components of the high-affinity ATP-driven
    potassium transport (or KDP) system, which catalyzes the
    hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of hydrogen and
    potassium ions (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + K(+)(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    K(+)(In).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the kdpA family.
