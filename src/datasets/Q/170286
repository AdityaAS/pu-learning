Neurotoxin III (Lqq III) (LqqIII) (Lqq3).
"Characterization of toxin III of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus
quinquestriatus: a new type of alpha-toxin highly toxic both to
mammals and insects.";
"Scorpion neurotoxins: a family of homologous proteins.";
"1H-NMR-derived secondary structure and the overall fold of the potent
anti-mammal and anti-insect toxin III from the scorpion Leiurus
quinquestriatus quinquestriatus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to sodium channels and inhibits the inactivation
    of the activated channels, thereby blocking neuronal transmission.
    This contractive toxin is highly toxic both to mammals and
    insects.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- TOXIC DOSE: LD(50) is 50 ug/kg by subcutaneous injection in mouse,
    60 ng/g in Blatella germanica and 120 ng/g in Musca domestica.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the long (4 C-C) scorpion toxin
    superfamily. Sodium channel inhibitor family. Alpha subfamily.
3D-structure; Direct protein sequencing; Ionic channel inhibitor;
Neurotoxin; Sodium channel inhibitor; Toxin.
