"Identification and characterization of a Chlamydia trachomatis early
operon encoding four novel inclusion membrane proteins.";
"Genome sequence of an obligate intracellular pathogen of humans:
Chlamydia trachomatis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inclusion membrane protein probably involved in early
    modification events of the chlamydial inclusion.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein. Note=Secreted, probably
    via type III secretion system. Localized to the inclusion
    membrane.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Co-transcribed with incD, incF and incG within 2
    hours after internalization.
