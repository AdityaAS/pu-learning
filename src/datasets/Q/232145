AC   Q576K1;
High-affinity zinc uptake system protein znuA precursor.
"Completion of the genome sequence of Brucella abortus and comparison
to the highly similar genomes of Brucella melitensis and Brucella
suis.";
"Zinc uptake system (znuA locus) of Brucella abortus is essential for
intracellular survival and virulence in mice.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the high-affinity zinc uptake transport
    system. Required for survival and normal growth under low Zn (2+)
    concentrations. Also required for virulence and intracellular
    growth in macrophages.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 9
    family.
