AC   P79100;
Short transient receptor potential channel 4 (TrpC4) (Capacitative
calcium entry channel 1) (CCE1).
"A mammalian capacitative calcium entry channel homologous to
Drosophila TRP and TRPL.";
"Alternative splicing and tissue specific expression of the 5'
truncated bCCE 1 variant bCCE 1delta514.";
-!- FUNCTION: Thought to form a receptor-activated non-selective
    calcium permeant cation channel. Probably is operated by a
    phosphatidylinositol second messenger system activated by receptor
    tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors. Has also been
    shown to be calcium-selective. May also be activated by
    intracellular calcium store depletion.
-!- SUBUNIT: Isoform alpha associates with inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate
    receptor (ITPR). Interacts with NHERF (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Alpha;
      IsoId=P79100-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Beta; Synonyms=Delta 514;
      IsoId=P79100-2; Sequence=VSP_006566;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in adrenal gland. Lower expression
    in heart and retina. Also expressed in testis. The short isoform
    is specifically expressed in the adrenal gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transient receptor family. STrpC
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ANK repeats.
