      IsoId=Q67UC7-2; Sequence=VSP_016304, VSP_016305;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HAK/KUP transporter (TC 2.A.72) family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (CAD20996) sequence differs from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (AK066194) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 490.
