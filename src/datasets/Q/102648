Monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT 4) (Solute carrier family 16 member
3).
"Characterization of the chicken and mouse MCT4 genes: tissue
distribution and relationship to other monocarboxylate transporters.";
-!- FUNCTION: Proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter. Catalyzes the
    rapid transport across the plasma membrane of many
    monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate, branched-chain oxo
    acids derived from leucine, valine and isoleucine, and the ketone
    bodies acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetate (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the major facilitator superfamily.
    Monocarboxylate porter (TC 2.A.1.13) family.
