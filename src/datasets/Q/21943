AC   Q9JJV3; Q543K0;
Voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma-like subunit (Neuronal
voltage-gated calcium channel gamma-like subunit) (Transmembrane
protein 37).
"A family of gamma-like calcium channel subunits.";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Thought to stabilize the calcium channel in an
    inactivated (closed) state (By similarity). Modulates calcium
    current when coexpressed with CACNA1G.
-!- SUBUNIT: The L-type calcium channel is composed of five subunits:
    alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta and gamma (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family. CACNG
    subfamily.
