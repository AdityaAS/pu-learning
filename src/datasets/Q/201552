AC   P50408;
Vacuolar ATP synthase subunit F (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-ATPase F subunit)
(Vacuolar proton pump F subunit) (V-ATPase 14 kDa subunit).
"Identification of a 14-kDa subunit associated with the catalytic
sector of clathrin-coated vesicle H+-ATPase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Subunit of the peripheral V1 complex of vacuolar ATPase
    essential for assembly or catalytic function. V-ATPase is
    responsible for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments
    in eukaryotic cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (components A to H) attached to an
    integral membrane V0 proton pore complex (components: a, c, c',
    c'' and d).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase F subunit family.
