Lantibiotic nisin-Z precursor.
"Identification and characterization of the lantibiotic nisin Z, a
natural nisin variant.";
"Genetic evidence that Lactococcus lactis JCM7638 produces a mutated
form of nisin.";
"The codon usage of the nisZ operon in Lactococcus lactis N8 suggests
a non-lactococcal origin of the conjugative nisin-sucrose
transposon.";
-!- FUNCTION: Lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic)
    active on Gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal activity of
    lantibiotics is based on depolarization of energized bacterial
    cytoplasmic membranes, initiated by the formation of aqueous
    transmembrane pores.
-!- PTM: Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of
    Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether
    bonds with cysteine. This is followed by membrane translocation
    and cleavage of the modified precursor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type A lantibiotic family.
