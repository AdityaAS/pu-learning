gamma subunit homolog).
"Complete genome sequence of the hyperthermophilic archaeon
Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 and comparison with Pyrococcus
genomes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the protein translocase complex.
    Heterotrimer consisting of alpha (secY), beta (secG) and gamma
