AC   O57728;
V-type ATP synthase alpha chain (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-type ATPase subunit
A) [Contains: Endonuclease PI-Pho2 (EC 3.1.-.-) (Pho atpA intein) (Pho
VMA intein)].
"Complete sequence and gene organization of the genome of a hyper-
thermophilic archaebacterium, Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton
    gradient across the membrane. The archaeal alpha chain is a
    catalytic subunit.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- PTM: This protein undergoes a protein self splicing that involves
    a post-translational excision of the VDE intervening region
    (intein) followed by peptide ligation (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The intein interrupts the ATP-binding site.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DOD-type homing endonuclease domain.
