Dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type calcium channel subunits alpha-
2/delta precursor [Contains: L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-2;
L-type calcium channel subunit delta].
"Tissue-specific expression of splice variants of the mouse voltage-
gated calcium channel alpha2/delta subunit.";
-!- FUNCTION: Calcium channel protein which plays an important role in
    excitation-contraction coupling.
-!- SUBUNIT: The L-type calcium channel is composed of four subunits:
    alpha-1, alpha-2, beta and gamma. Alpha-2 and delta forms
    heterodimers that are disulfide-linked (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:

      IsoId=O08532-5; Sequence=VSP_050444, VSP_050446;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Isoform 2A is expressed in skeletal muscle and
    aorta. Isoform 2B is expressed in brain. Isoform 2C is expressed
    in heart. Isoform 2D is expressed in heart and smooth muscle.
    Isoform 2E is expressed in smooth muscle. All five isoforms are
    expressed in the cardiovascular system.
-!- PTM: Alpha-2 and delta subunits are proteolytically processed from
    a precursor form.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 VWFA domain.
