AC   P23702;
Leukotoxin translocation ATP-binding protein lktB (EC 3.6.3.43).
"Sequence of the lktB gene from Actinobacillus
actinomycetemcomitans.";
"Structure and function of the B and D genes of the Actinobacillus
actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin complex.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex lktBD involved in
    leukotoxin export. Transmembrane domains (TMD) form a pore in the
    inner membrane and the ATP-binding domain (NBD) is responsible for
    energy generation (Probable).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + peptide(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    peptide(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- DOMAIN: In lktB the peptidase C39 domain, the ATP-binding domain
    (NBD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) are fused.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Protein-1
    exporter (TC 3.A.1.109) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase C39 domain.
-!- CAUTION: Leu-9 is present instead of the conserved Cys which is
    expected to be the active site residue of peptidase C39. Thus they
    are presumed to be without peptidase activity.
