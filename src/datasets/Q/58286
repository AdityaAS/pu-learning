AC   P59645;
FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 3 precursor.
"The FXYD gene family of small ion transport regulators or channels:
cDNA sequence, protein signature sequence, and expression.";
-!- FUNCTION: Induces a hyperpolarization-activated chloride current
    when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. May be a modulator capable of
    activating endogenous oocyte channels.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FXYD family.
