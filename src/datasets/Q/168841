Zinc transporter ZIP1 (Zinc-iron-regulated transporter-like) (Solute
carrier family 39 member 1).
"Isolation and characterization of human and mouse ZIRTL, a member of
the IRT1 family of transporters, mapping within the epidermal
differentiation complex.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates zinc uptake. May function as a major endogenous
    zinc uptake transporter in many cells of the body (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous. Highest levels seen in kidney,
    salivary gland and placenta.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Found to be developmentally regulated in the
    skin where it is expressed in the epidermal layer, excluding the
    dermis, at embryonic day E17.5 but not in E10.5 and E15.5. In the
    small intestine found toward the base of the intestinal villi from
    E17.5. In the pancreas, expression was detected from E17.5 and no
    expression was found in the liver. Also expressed in osteoblats of
    developing bone from E15.5.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ZIP transporter (TC 2.A.5) family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (CAB59982) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 4 and 291.
