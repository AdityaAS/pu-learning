AC   P53517;
Outer membrane usher protein afaC precursor.
"Nucleotide sequence of the afimbrial-adhesin-encoding afa-3 gene
cluster and its translocation via flanking IS1 insertion sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the export and assembly of AFA-III afimbrial
    adhesin subunits across the outer membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fimbrial export usher family.
-!- CAUTION: It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-9 is the initiator.
