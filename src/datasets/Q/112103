AC   P38681; Q7RVB5;
Nitrite reductase [NAD(P)H] (EC 1.7.1.4).
"Molecular cloning, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of nit-
6, the structural gene for nitrite reductase in Neurospora crassa.";
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Ammonium hydroxide + 3 NAD(P)(+) + H(2)O =
    nitrite + 3 NAD(P)H.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 siroheme per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: FAD.
-!- PATHWAY: Nitrate assimilation (denitrification); second step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nitrite and sulfite reductase 4Fe-4S
    domain family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Rieske domain.
