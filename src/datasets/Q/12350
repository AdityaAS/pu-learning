AC   P70704;
Probable phospholipid-transporting ATPase IA (EC 3.6.3.1) (Chromaffin
granule ATPase II) (ATPase class I type 8A member 1).
"Multiple members of a third subfamily of P-type ATPases identified by
genomic sequences and ESTs.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play a role in the transport of aminophospholipids
    from the outer to the inner leaflet of various membranes and the
    maintenance of asymmetric distribution of phospholipids, mainly in
    secretory vesicles.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O = ADP + phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic vesicle; secretory vesicle;
    chromaffin granule; chromaffin granule membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found in most tissues except liver and testis.
    Most abundant in brain and lung. Also detected in fetal tissues.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IV subfamily.
