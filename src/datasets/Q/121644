AC   Q96RD6; Q96RD5; Q9UGX8;
Pannexin-2.
"The mammalian pannexin family is homologous to the invertebrate
innexin gap junction proteins.";
"The DNA sequence of human chromosome 22.";
-!- FUNCTION: Structural component of the gap junctions.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms heteromeric channels with PANX1. Does not form
    homomeric channels (By similarity).
