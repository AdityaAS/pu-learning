AC   Q93AR8;
Pyrophosphate-energized proton pump 1 (EC 3.6.1.1) (Pyrophosphate-
energized inorganic pyrophosphatase 1) (H+-PPase 1) (Membrane-bound
proton-translocating pyrophosphatase 1) (Fragment).
"High prevalence of the H+-proton-pumping inorganic pyrophosphatase
gene in alpha proteobacteria and evidence of lateral transfer in its
phylogeny.";
-!- FUNCTION: Generates a proton motive force; it probably catalyzes a
    fully reversible reaction, thus being able to synthesize
    pyrophosphate when the proton motive force is sufficient (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Diphosphate + H(2)O = 2 phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase
    (TC 3.A.10) family. Type 2 subfamily.
