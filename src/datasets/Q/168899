AC   Q90ZM2; Q7ZU31;
Protein transport protein Sec61 subunit alpha isoform A.
-!- FUNCTION: Appears to play a crucial role in the insertion of
    secretory and membrane polypeptides into the ER. It is required
    for assembly of membrane and secretory proteins. Found to be
    tightly associated with membrane-bound ribosomes, either directly
    or through adaptor proteins (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimeric complex composed of SEC61-alpha, SEC61-
    beta and SEC61-gamma (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secY/SEC61-alpha family.
