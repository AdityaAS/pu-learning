AC   Q5R6I1;
Vacuolar ATP synthase subunit d (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-ATPase d subunit)
(Vacuolar proton pump subunit d).
-!- FUNCTION: Subunit of the integral membrane V0 complex of vacuolar
    ATPase. Vacuolar ATPase is responsible for acidifying a variety of
    intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells, thus providing
    most of the energy required for transport processes in the
    vacuolar system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (components A to H) attached to an
    integral membrane V0 proton pore complex (components: a, c, c',
    c'' and d) (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase V0D/AC39 subunit family.
