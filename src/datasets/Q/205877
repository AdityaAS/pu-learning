AC   P60980;
Voltage sensor toxin 1 (VSTX1).
"Functional analysis of an archaebacterial voltage-dependent K+
channel.";
"A membrane-access mechanism of ion channel inhibition by voltage
sensor toxins from spider venom.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits the potassium channel KvAP from A.pernix
    (APE0955) with very slow apparent binding kinetics. Inhibits
    through lipid membrane access by partitioning into the lipd
    membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- PTM: Contains three disulfide bonds.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the huwentoxin-1 family.
Direct protein sequencing; Ionic channel inhibitor; Neurotoxin;
Potassium channel inhibitor; Toxin.
