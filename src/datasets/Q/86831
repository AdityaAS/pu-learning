-!- FUNCTION: Pore-forming (alpha) subunit of voltage-gated rapidly
    inactivating A-type potassium channels. May contribute to I(To)
    current in heart and I(Sa) current in neurons. Channel properties
    are modulated by interactions with other alpha subunits and with
    regulatory subunits.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer or heterotetramer with KCND2 and/or KCND3.
    Associates with the regulatory subunits KCNIP1, KCNIP2, KCNIP3 and
    KCNIP4 (By similarity). Interacts with DPP10 (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Highly expressed in brain,
    in particular in cerebellum and thalamus; detected at lower levels
    in the other parts of the brain.
-!- DOMAIN: The segment S4 is probably the voltage-sensor and is
    characterized by a series of positively charged amino acids at
    every third position.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family. D (Shal)
    subfamily.
