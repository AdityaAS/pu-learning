Aquaporin Z (Aquaporin X).
"A functional water channel protein in the pathogenic bacterium
Brucella abortus.";
"Whole-genome analyses of speciation events in pathogenic Brucellae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transport of water across the membrane. Possibly
    involved in the adaptation to variation in intravacuolar pH or
    osmolarity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- DOMAIN: Aquaporins contain two tandem repeats each containing
    three membrane-spanning domains and a pore-forming loop with the
    signature motif Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MIP/aquaporin (TC 1.A.8) family.
