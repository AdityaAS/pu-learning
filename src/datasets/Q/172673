S-layer protein (Paracrystalline surface layer protein).
"Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gene encoding the Caulobacter
crescentus paracrystalline surface layer protein.";
"The secretion signal of C. crescentus S-layer protein is located in
the C-terminal 82 amino acids of the molecule.";
"Complete genome sequence of Caulobacter crescentus.";
"Transcriptional analysis of the major surface array gene of
Caulobacter crescentus.";
"The Caulobacter crescentus paracrystalline S-layer protein is
secreted by an ABC transporter (type I) secretion apparatus.";
-!- FUNCTION: The S-layer is a paracrystalline mono-layered assembly
    of proteins which coats the surface of bacteria. Probably acts as
    a physical barrier to parasites and lytic enzymes.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell wall. Note=This bacterium is covered by
    a S-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Secreted by an ABC transporter
    (type I) secretion apparatus.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The calcium binding of this protein may mediate
    surface attachment by ionic bridging between the S-layer and a
    specific membrane-associated oligosaccharide.
