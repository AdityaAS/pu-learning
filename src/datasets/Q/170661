AC   Q9PLM5;
Preprotein translocase secA subunit.
"Genome sequences of Chlamydia trachomatis MoPn and Chlamydia
pneumoniae AR39.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export. Interacts with the secY/secE
    subunits. SecA has a central role in coupling the hydrolysis of
    ATP to the transfer of pre-secretory periplasmic and outer
    membrane proteins across the membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus
    which comprise secA, secB, secD, secE, secF, secG and secY (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein; cytoplasmic side (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secA family.
