3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) (HMG-CoA
reductase).
"3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase of the sea urchin
embryo. Deduced structure and regulatory properties.";
"3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in the sea urchin
embryo is developmentally regulated.";
-!- FUNCTION: This transmembrane glycoprotein is involved in the
    control of cholesterol biosynthesis. It is the rate-limiting
    enzyme of sterol biosynthesis.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (R)-mevalonate + CoA + 2 NADP(+) = (S)-3-
    hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA + 2 NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; mevalonate
    biosynthesis; R-mevalonate from acetyl-CoA: step 3 [final step].
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Cholesterol biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HMG-CoA reductase family.
