AC   P13345;
Lysis protein for colicin E6 precursor.
"Nucleotide sequences from the colicin E5, E6 and E9 operons: presence
of a degenerate transposon-like structure in the ColE9-J plasmid.";
"Molecular structure and immunity specificity of colicin E6, an
evolutionary intermediate between E-group colicins and cloacin DF13.";
-!- FUNCTION: Lysis proteins are required for both colicin release and
    partial cell lysis.
