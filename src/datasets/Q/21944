AC   Q8VHW1;
Voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma-like subunit (Neuronal
voltage-gated calcium channel gamma-like subunit) (Transmembrane
protein 37).
"Calcium channel gamma subunits provide insights into the evolution of
this gene family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Thought to stabilize the calcium channel in an
    inactivated (closed) state. Modulates calcium current when
    coexpressed with CACNA1G (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The L-type calcium channel is composed of five subunits:
    alpha-1, alpha-2/delta, beta and gamma (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PMP-22/EMP/MP20 family. CACNG
    subfamily.
