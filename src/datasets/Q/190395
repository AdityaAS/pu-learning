"Nucleotide sequence of a gene cluster involved in entry of E colicins
and single-stranded DNA of infecting filamentous bacteriophages into
Escherichia coli.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains

first transmembrane segment.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the tonB-independent uptake of group A
    colicins (colicins A, E1, E2, E3, and K).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass type II
    membrane protein.
