AC   Q80XF7;
Gap junction alpha-12 protein (Connexin-47) (Cx47).
"Genome sequence of the Brown Norway rat yields insights into
mammalian evolution.";
"The detection of hamster connexins: a comparison of expression
profiles with wild-type mouse and the cancer-prone min mouse.";
"Unique distributions of the gap junction proteins connexin29,
connexin32, and connexin47 in oligodendrocytes.";
-!- FUNCTION: One gap junction consists of a cluster of closely packed
    pairs of transmembrane channels, the connexons, through which
    materials of low MW diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell.
    May play a role in myelination in central and peripheral nervous
    systems (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: A connexon is composed of a hexamer of connexins.
    Interacts with TJP1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Mainly expressed by oligodendrocytes in the
    central nervous system. Expressed in optic nerve (at protein
    level).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the connexin family. Alpha-type (group II)
    subfamily.
