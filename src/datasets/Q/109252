AC   Q8U7P1; Q7CUV7;
Periplasmic nitrate reductase precursor (EC 1.7.99.4).
"The genome of the natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens
C58.";
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen and biotechnology agent
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalytic subunit of the periplasmic nitrate reductase
    (NAP). Only expressed at high levels during aerobic growth. NapAB
    complex receives electrons from the membrane-anchored tetraheme
    protein napC, thus allowing electron flow between membrane and
    periplasm. Essential function for nitrate assimilation and may
    have a role in anaerobic metabolism (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nitrite + acceptor = nitrate + reduced
    acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 molybdenum ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) groups
    per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with napB (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
    oxidoreductase family. NasA/napA/narB subfamily.
