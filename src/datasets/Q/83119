AC   Q9XYN0;
Innexin inx1 (Innexin-1) (G-Inx1).
"Developmental expression and molecular characterization of two gap
junction channel proteins expressed during embryogenesis in the
grasshopper Schistocerca americana.";
-!- FUNCTION: Structural components of the gap junctions.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in embryonic neural precursors
    including the dorsal median neuroblast, glial cells, neuropilar
    glial ring, developing myoblasts cells and in a circumferential
    band of epithelial cells at the trochanter/coxa boundary stripe in
    the developing limb.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Embryonic development.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pannexin family.
Gap junction; Membrane; Transmembrane.
