AC   P95784;
ATP synthase a chain (EC 3.6.3.14) (ATPase protein 6).
"Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of the Streptococcus mutans
membrane-bound, proton-translocating ATPase operon.";
"Genome sequence of Streptococcus mutans UA159, a cariogenic dental
pathogen.";
-!- FUNCTION: Key component of the proton channel; it may play a
    direct role in the translocation of protons across the membrane.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase A chain family.
