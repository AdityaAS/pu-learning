AC   Q9PTS8;
Neuronal acetylcholine receptor protein subunit alpha-9 precursor
(Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 9) (NACHR alpha 9).
"Cloning and expression of the alpha9 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
subunit in cochlear hair cells of the chick.";
-!- FUNCTION: Ionotropic receptor with a probable role in the
    modulation of auditory stimuli (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in hair cells of the cochlea.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ligand-gated ionic channel (TC 1.A.9)
    family.
