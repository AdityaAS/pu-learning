-!- FUNCTION: Transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory
    chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed
    to be ubiquinone.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone = NAD(+) + ubiquinol.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + acceptor = NAD(+) + reduced acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FMN (Potential).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster (Potential).
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex I is composed of 45 different subunits. This is a
    component of the flavoprotein-sulfur (FP) fragment of the enzyme.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    peripheral membrane protein; matrix side.

-!- DISEASE: Defects in NDUFV1 are a cause of Alexander disease
    [MIM:203450]. Alexander disease is characterized clinically by
    development of megalencephaly in infancy accompanied by
    progressive spasticity and dementia.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in NDUFV1 are a cause of Leigh syndrome (LS)
    [MIM:256000]. LS is a severe neurological disorder characterized
    by bilaterally symmetrical necrotic lesions in subcortical brain
    regions.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in NDUFV1 are a cause of complex I mitochondrial
    respiratory chain deficiency [MIM:252010]. Complex I (NADH-
    ubiquinone oxidoreductase), the largest complex of the
    mitochondrial respiratory chain, contains more than 40 subunits.
    It is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is partly
    protruding in the matrix. Complex I deficiency is the most common
    cause of mitochondrial disorders. It represents largely one-third
    of all cases of respiratory chain deficiency and is responsible
    for a variety of clinical symptoms, ranging from neurological
    disorders to cardiomyopathy, liver failure, and myopathy.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I 51 kDa subunit family.
