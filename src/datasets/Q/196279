AC   P25866;
Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-17 kDa (EC 6.3.2.19) (Ubiquitin-
protein ligase) (Ubiquitin carrier protein).
"Cloning of a 16-kDa ubiquitin carrier protein from wheat and
Arabidopsis thaliana. Identification of functional domains by in vitro
mutagenesis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other
    proteins.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + ubiquitin + protein lysine = AMP +
    diphosphate + protein N-ubiquityllysine.
-!- PATHWAY: Ubiquitin conjugation; second step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family.
Ligase; Ubl conjugation pathway.
