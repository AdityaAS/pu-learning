AC   Q9K0K9;
Iron-regulated protein frpA.
"Complete genome sequence of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain
MC58.";
-!- FUNCTION: May participate in the pathogenesis of meningococcal
    disease.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity). Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The Gly-rich region is probably involved in binding
    calcium, which is required for target cell-binding or cytolytic
    activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RTX prokaryotic toxin (TC 1.C.11)
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 12 hemolysin-type calcium-binding repeats.
