AC   Q05962;
ADP/ATP translocase 1 (Adenine nucleotide translocator 1) (ANT 1)
(ADP,ATP carrier protein 1) (Solute carrier family 25 member 4).
"Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones and a genomic clone
encoding rat mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the exchange of ADP and ATP across the
    mitochondrial inner membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: In heart, skeletal muscle and to a lesser
    extent, in brain and kidney.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The transmembrane helices are not perpendicular to
    the plane of the membrane, but cross the membrane at an angle.
    Odd-numbered transmembrane helices exhibit a sharp kink, due to
    the presence of a conserved proline residue (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Solcar repeats.
