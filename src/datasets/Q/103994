Na(+)/H(+) antiporter subunit B (Multiple resistance and pH
homeostasis protein B) (Mrp complex subunit B).

sequence of a 62 kb region between 275 degrees (rrnB) and 284 degrees
(pai).";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus

"mrp, a multigene, multifunctional locus in Bacillus subtilis with
roles in resistance to cholate and to Na+ and in pH homeostasis.";
"Mrp-dependent Na(+)/H(+) antiporters of Bacillus exhibit
characteristics that are unanticipated for completely secondary active
transporters.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mrp complex is a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter that is
    considered to be the major Na(+) excretion system in B.subtilis.
    Has a major role in Na(+) resistance and a minor role in Na(+)-
    and K(+)-dependent pH homeostasis as compared to tetB. MrpA may be
    the actual Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, although the six other mrp
    proteins are all required for Na(+)/H(+) antiport activity and
    Na(+) resistance.
-!- SUBUNIT: May form a hetero-oligomeric complex that consists of
    seven subunits: mrpA, mrpB, mrpC, mrpD, mrpE, mrpF and mrpG.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Mrp-dependent antiport apparently occurs by a
    secondary, proton motive force-dependent mechanism, but the
    similarity of several mrp proteins to membrane-embedded subunits
    of energy-coupled NADH dehydrogenase complexes raises the
    possibility that there is a capacity for electron transport that
    could provide a primary energy coupling option for mrp functions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CPA3 antiporters (TC 2.A.63) subunit B
    family.
