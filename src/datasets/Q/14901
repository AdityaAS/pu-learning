AC   Q05366;
ATP synthase C chain (EC 3.6.3.14) (Lipid-binding protein).
"Organization and sequences of genes for the subunits of ATP synthase
in the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus 6716.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the four chains of the nonenzymatic
    component (CF(0) subunit) of the ATPase complex.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase C chain family.
