Gap junction alpha-7 protein (Connexin-43.4) (Cx43.4).
"Expression of zebrafish connexin43.4 in the notochord and tail bud of
wild-type and mutant no tail embryos.";
-!- FUNCTION: One gap junction consists of a cluster of closely packed
    pairs of transmembrane channels, the connexons, through which
    materials of low MW diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell.
    Participates in a developmental pathway for formation of the
    notochord and tail.
-!- SUBUNIT: A connexon is composed of a hexamer of connexins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the connexin family. Alpha-type (group II)
    subfamily.
Gap junction; Membrane; Transmembrane.
