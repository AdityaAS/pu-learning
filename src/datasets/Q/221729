"Genomic organization of the Klebsiella pneumoniae cps region
responsible for serotype K2 capsular polysaccharide synthesis in the
virulent strain Chedid.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + a
    [protein]-L-tyrosine phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the etk/wzc family.
