AC   Q9JVQ0;
Na(+)-translocating NADH-quinone reductase subunit C (EC 1.6.5.-)
(Na(+)-translocating NQR subunit C) (Na(+)-NQR subunit C) (NQR complex
subunit C) (NQR-1 subunit C).
"Complete DNA sequence of a serogroup A strain of Neisseria
meningitidis Z2491.";
-!- FUNCTION: NQR complex catalyzes the reduction of ubiquinone-1 to
    ubiquinol by two successive reactions, coupled with the transport
    of Na(+) ions from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. NqrA to nqrE
    are probably involved in the second step, the conversion of
    ubisemiquinone to ubiquinol (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone + Na(+)(In) = NAD(+) +
    ubiquinol + Na(+)(Out).
-!- COFACTOR: FMN (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of six subunits; nqrA, nqrB, nqrC, nqrD, nqrE
    and nqrF (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nqrC family.
-!- CAUTION: The residue potentially involved in the covalent binding
    of FMN is a Ser instead of a Thr.
