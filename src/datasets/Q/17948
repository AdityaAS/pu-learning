Branched-chain amino acid transport system II carrier protein (LIV-
II).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the LIV-II transport system for branched-
    chain amino acids. This LIV-II transport system may be H(+)-
    coupled (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the braC/braZ/brnQ transporter family.
