AC   Q71S46;
ATP synthase lipid-binding protein, mitochondrial precursor
(EC 3.6.3.14) (ATP synthase proteolipid P3) (ATPase protein 9) (ATPase
subunit C).
"Rat mitochondrial ATP synthase ATP5G3: cloning and upregulation in
pancreas after chronic ethanol feeding.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is one of the chains of the nonenzymatic
    membrane component (F0) of mitochondrial ATPase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- DISEASE: This protein is the major protein stored in the storage
    bodies of animals or humans affected with ceroid lipofuscinosis
    (Batten disease).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: There are three genes which encode the
    mitochondrial ATP synthase proteolipid and they specify precursors
    with different import sequences but identical mature proteins
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase C chain family.
