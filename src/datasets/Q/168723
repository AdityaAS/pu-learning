-!- FUNCTION: Sodium/ascorbate cotransporter. Mediates electrogenic
    uptake of vitamin C, with a stoichiometry of 2 Na(+) for each
    ascorbate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
      Comment=Experimental confirmation may be lacking for some
      isoforms;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q9UHI7-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q9UHI7-2; Sequence=VSP_006814;
      Note=Inactive;
    Name=3;
      IsoId=Q9UHI7-3; Sequence=VSP_006813;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in adult small intestine,
    kidney, thymus, ovary, colon, prostate and liver, and in fetal
    kidney, liver and thymus.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (Probable).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Treatment with the protein kinase C stimulator PMA
    results in a 10-fold decrease in ascorbate accumulation in
    transfected cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the xanthine/uracil permease family. SLC23A
    subfamily.
