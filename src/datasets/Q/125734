AC   P37433;
Phosphoglycerate transport system sensor protein pgtB (EC 2.7.13.3).
"Identification of the products and nucleotide sequences of two
regulatory genes involved in the exogenous induction of
phosphoglycerate transport in Salmonella typhimurium.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Genetic evidence for modulation of the activator by two regulatory
proteins involved in the exogenous induction of phosphoglycerate
transport in Salmonella typhimurium.";
-!- FUNCTION: Member of the two-component regulatory system pgtB/pgtA
    that regulates the inducible phosphoglycerate transport system.
    Activates pgtA by phosphorylation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + protein L-histidine = ADP + protein N-
    phospho-L-histidine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HAMP domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 histidine kinase domain.
