"Podocin, a raft-associated component of the glomerular slit
diaphragm, interacts with CD2AP and nephrin.";

"NEPH1 defines a novel family of podocin interacting proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in the regulation of glomerular
    permeability, acting probably as a linker between the plasma
    membrane and the cytoskeleton (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with nephrin/NPHS1, KIRRL1 and CD2AP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the band 7/mec-2 family.
