AC   Q69BK5;
Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase iron-sulfur subunit, mitochondrial
precursor (EC 1.10.2.2) (Rieske iron-sulfur protein) (RISP).
"Molecular evolution of the iron sulfur protein and subunit 9 of
complex III of the electron transport chain in primates.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase
    complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), which is a
    respiratory chain that generates an electrochemical potential
    coupled to ATP synthesis (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: QH(2) + 2 ferricytochrome c = Q + 2
    ferrocytochrome c.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The bc1 complex contains 11 subunits; 3 respiratory
    subunits (cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, Rieske protein), 2 core
    proteins and 6 low-molecular weight proteins (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane
    (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The Rieske protein is a high potential 2Fe-2S
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Rieske domain.
