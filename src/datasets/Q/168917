AC   P31650;
Sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA transporter 4 (GAT4).
"Molecular characterization of four pharmacologically distinct gamma-
aminobutyric acid transporters in mouse brain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Terminates the action of GABA by its high affinity
    sodium-dependent reuptake into presynaptic terminals. Can also
    transport beta-alanine and taurine.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=0.8 uM for GABA;
      KM=99 uM for beta-alanine;
      KM=1.4 mM for taurine;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
