AC   Q73YL6;
Probable cytochrome c oxidase polypeptide 4 (EC 1.9.3.1) (Cytochrome c
oxidase polypeptide IV) (Cytochrome aa3 subunit 4).
"The complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium avium subspecies
paratuberculosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of cytochrome c oxidase, its function is unknown
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Associates with subunits I, II and III to form cytochrome
    c oxidase (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase bacterial subunit
    ctaF family.
