AC   O15821;
Signal recognition particle 54 kDa protein (SRP54).
"Entamoeba histolytica contains a gene encoding a homologue to the 54
kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to the signal sequence of presecretory protein
    when they emerge from the ribosomes and transfers them to TRAM
    (translocating chain-associating membrane protein).
-!- SUBUNIT: Signal recognition particle consists of a 7S RNA molecule
    of 300 nucleotides and six protein subunits: SRP72, SRP68, SRP54,
    SRP19, SRP14 and SRP9 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- DOMAIN: Has a two domain structure: the G-domain binds GTP; the M-
    domain binds the 7S RNA in presence of SRP19 and also binds the
    signal sequence.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GTP-binding SRP family.
