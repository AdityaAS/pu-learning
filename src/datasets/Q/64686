"Corynebacterium efficiens gluA, gluB, gluC and gluD genes, complete
CDS.";
"Comparative complete genome sequence analysis of the amino acid
replacements responsible for the thermostability of Corynebacterium
efficiens.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for glutamate; probably responsible for the translocation of the
    substrate across the membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. HisMQ subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
