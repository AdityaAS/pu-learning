AC   O29101;
V-type ATP synthase alpha chain (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-type ATPase subunit
A).
"The complete genome sequence of the hyperthermophilic, sulphate-
reducing archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton
    gradient across the membrane. The archaeal alpha chain is a
    catalytic subunit.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
