AC   Q8PSR0;
Putative cobalt import ATP-binding protein cbiO 7.
"The genome of Methanosarcina mazei: evidence for lateral gene
transfer between Bacteria and Archaea.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex cbiONQ involved in
    cobalt import. Responsible for energy coupling to the transport
    system (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (cbiO), fused or not, two transmembrane proteins (cbiQ) and a
    solute-binding protein (cbiN) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Cobalt importer
    (TC 3.A.1.18.1) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
