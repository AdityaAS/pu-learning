Pesticidal crystal protein cry1Ca (Insecticidal delta-endotoxin
CryIC(a)) (Crystaline entomocidal protoxin) (134 kDa crystal protein).
"Bacillus thuringiensis isolate active against lepidopteran pests, and
genes encoding novel lepidopteran-active toxins.";
"Nucleotide sequence and analysis of the N-terminal coding region of
the Spodoptera-active delta-endotoxin gene of Bacillus thuringiensis
aizawai 7.29.";
-!- FUNCTION: Promotes colloidosmotic lysis by binding to the midgut
    epithelial cells of many lepidopteran larvae including Spodoptera
    species.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: The crystal protein is produced during
    sporulation and is accumulated both as an inclusion and as part of
    the spore coat.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Toxic segment of the protein is located in the N-
    terminus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the delta endotoxin family.
Sporulation; Toxin.
