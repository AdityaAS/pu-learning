AC   O51507;
Phosphocarrier protein HPr (Histidine-containing protein).
"Genomic sequence of a Lyme disease spirochaete, Borrelia
burgdorferi.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent
    sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system. The phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate
    (PEP) is transferred to the phosphoryl carrier protein HPr by
    enzyme I. Phospho-HPr then transfers it to the permease (enzymes
    II/III). HPr is common to all PTS (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HPr family.
