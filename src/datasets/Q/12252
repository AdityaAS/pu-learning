AC   P51165;
Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1 (Sodium/potassium-
dependent ATPase beta subunit).
"Primary sequence, tissue specificity and expression of the Na+,K(+)-
ATPase alpha 1 subunit in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla).";
"Primary sequence, tissue specificity and expression of the Na+,K(+)-
ATPase beta 1 subunit in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla).";
-!- FUNCTION: This is the non-catalytic component of the active
    enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the
    exchange of Na(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane. The
    beta subunit regulates, through assembly of alpha/beta
    heterodimers, the number of sodium pumps transported to the plasma
    membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of three subunits: alpha (catalytic), beta and
    gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Detected in all tissues except liver and
    cardiac muscle. Highest levels found in intestine, ovary and
    kidney with marginally lower levels in brain, spleen, esophagus,
    eye and pancreas, intermediate levels in gill and low levels in
    white and red skeletal muscle.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Na+/K+ and H+/K+ ATPases subunit beta
    family.
