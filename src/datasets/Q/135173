Phosphate import ATP-binding protein pstB (EC 3.6.3.27) (Phosphate-
transporting ATPase) (ABC phosphate transporter).
"Comparative analysis of the genome sequences of Bordetella pertussis,
Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex pstSACB involved in
    phosphate import. Responsible for energy coupling to the transport
    system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + phosphate(Out) = ADP + phosphate
    + phosphate(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (pstB), two transmembrane proteins (pstC and pstA) and a solute-
    binding protein (pstS) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Phosphate
    importer (TC 3.A.1.7) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
