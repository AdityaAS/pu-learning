AC   Q9M7K4; Q9T0L3;
Potassium transporter 5 (AtPOT5) (AtHAK1) (AtHAK5).
"Cloning of Arabidopsis and barley cDNAs encoding HAK potassium
transporters in root and shoot cells.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 4 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Phylogenetic relationships within cation transporter families of
Arabidopsis.";
-!- FUNCTION: High-affinity potassium transporter. Could also
    transport rubidium and cesium.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominantly expressed in the roots.
-!- INDUCTION: In both roots and shoots by potassium starvation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HAK/KUP transporter (TC 2.A.72) family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequences differ from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
