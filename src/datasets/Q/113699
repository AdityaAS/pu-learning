Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP 1).
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Genomic cloning and genetic mapping of the rat Nramp1 (Bcg) gene on
chromosome 9.";
-!- FUNCTION: Divalent transition metal (iron and manganese)
    transporter involved in iron metabolism and host resistance to
    certain pathogens. Macrophage-specific membrane transport
    function. Controls natural resistance to infection with
    intracellular parasites. Pathogen resistance involves
    sequestration of Fe(2+) and Mn(2+), cofactors of both prokaryotic
    and eukaryotic catalases and superoxide dismutases, not only to
    protect the macrophage against its own generation of reactive
    oxygen species, but to deny the cations to the pathogen for
    synthesis of its protective enzymes (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NRAMP family.
