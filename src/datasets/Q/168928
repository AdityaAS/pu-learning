Sodium- and chloride-dependent neutral and basic amino acid
transporter B(0+) (Amino acid transporter ATB0+) (Colonic system B0+
amino acid transporter CATB0+) (Solute carrier family 6 member 14).
"Characterization of a mouse colonic system B(0+) amino acid
transporter related to amino acid absorption in colon.";
"Na(+)- and Cl(-)-coupled active transport of nitric oxide synthase
inhibitors via amino acid transport system B(0,+).";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the uptake of a broad range of neutral and
    cationic amino acids (with the exception of proline) in a
    (Na+/Cl-)-dependent manner.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the distal region of the
    intestinal tract: cecum and colon.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:neurotransmitter symporter (SNF)
    family.
