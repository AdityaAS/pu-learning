-!- FUNCTION: Transports L-glutamate and also L- and D-aspartate.
    Essential for terminating the postsynaptic action of glutamate by
    rapidly removing released glutamate from the synaptic cleft. Acts
    as a symport by cotransporting sodium. Negatively regulated by
    ARL6IP5.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with ARL6IP5/PRAF3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed to a high extent in brain and
    kidney, and to a lower extent in heart, lung and skeletal muscle.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sodium:dicarboxylate (SDF) symporter
    (TC 2.A.23) family.
