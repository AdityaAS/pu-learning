Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 precursor (LAMP-2).
"The family of LAMP-2 proteins arises by alternative splicing from a
single gene: characterization of the avian LAMP-2 gene and
identification of mammalian homologs of LAMP-2b and LAMP-2c.";
-!- FUNCTION: Implicated in tumor cell metastasis. May function in
    protection of the lysosomal membrane from autodigestion,
    maintenance of the acidic environment of the lysosome, adhesion
    when expressed on the cell surface (plasma membrane), and inter-
    and intracellular signal transduction (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (By similarity). Endosome; endosomal membrane; single-pass
    type I membrane protein (By similarity). Lysosome; lysosomal
    membrane; single-pass type I membrane protein (By similarity).
    Note=This protein shuttles between lysosomes, endosomes, and the
    plasma membrane (By similarity).
