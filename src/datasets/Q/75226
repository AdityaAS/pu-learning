AC   Q6H501; Q8L4V1;
Probable cation transporter HKT6 (OsHKT6).
"Sodium transport and HKT transporters: the rice model.";
"Oryza sativa nipponbare chromosome 2 genomic DNA sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable cation transporter. May be involved in
    regulation of K(+)/Na(+) homeostasis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Weakly expressed.
-!- DOMAIN: HKT transporters are proposed to contain 4 pore-forming
    regions enclosed by transmembrane segments with each containing a
    potassium channel-like selectivity filter motif.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the trkH potassium transport family. HKT
    subfamily.
