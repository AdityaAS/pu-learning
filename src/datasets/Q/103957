-!- FUNCTION: Pump for glutathione S-conjugates (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + xenobiotic(In) = ADP + phosphate
    + xenobiotic(Out).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).

-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Conjugate
    transporter (TC 3.A.1.208) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transmembrane type-1 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
