Vacuolar ATP synthase 16 kDa proteolipid subunit 2 (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-
ATPase 16 kDa proteolipid subunit 2).
"Several distinct genes encode nearly identical to 16 kDa proteolipids
of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase from Arabidopsis thaliana.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
-!- FUNCTION: Proton-conducting pore forming subunit of the membrane
    integral V0 complex of vacuolar ATPase. V-ATPase is responsible
    for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in
    eukaryotic cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (main components: subunits A, B,
    C, D, E, and F) attached to an integral membrane V0 proton pore
    complex (main component: the proteolipid protein; which is present
    as a hexamer that forms the proton-conducting pore).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein. Note=Tonoplast.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in leaf, root, flower and silique,
    with lower expression in roots.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the V-ATPase proteolipid subunit family.
