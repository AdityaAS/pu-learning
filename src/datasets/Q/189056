AC   Q6CDV7;
Import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM50, mitochondrial
precursor.
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential component of the TIM23 complex, a complex that
    mediates the translocation of transit peptide-containing proteins
    across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Required to direct
    preproteins in transit and direct them to the channel protein
    TIM23, and possibly facilitates transfer of the translocating
    proteins from the TOM complex to the TIM23 complex (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the TIM23 complex, at least composed of
    TIM23, TIM17, TIM50 and TIM21. Interacts with preproteins in
    transit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    single-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TIM50 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 FCP1 homology domain.
