AC   P26591;
Glutamate receptor precursor.
"Cloning of a cDNA that encodes an invertebrate glutamate receptor
subunit.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for glutamate. L-glutamate acts as an
    excitatory neurotransmitter at many synapses in the central
    nervous system. The postsynaptic actions of Glu are mediated by a
    variety of receptors.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glutamate-gated ion channel (TC 1.A.10)
    family.
