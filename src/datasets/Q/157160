AC   Q9ZLA0;
Rod shape-determining protein rodA.
"Genomic sequence comparison of two unrelated isolates of the human
gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the proteins responsible for the rod
    shape of the cell. It is required for the expression of the
    enzymatic activity of PBP2, which is thought to synthesize
    peptidoglycan in the step of initiation of cell elongation (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ftsW/rodA/spoVE family.
