AC   Q8R5I0; Q920G1;
Potassium channel subfamily K member 15 (Acid-sensitive potassium
channel protein TASK-5) (TWIK-related acid-sensitive K(+) channel 5)
(rTASK-5).
"Expression pattern in brain of TASK-1, TASK-3, and a tandem pore
domain K(+) channel subunit, TASK-5, associated with the central
auditory nervous system.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable potassium channel subunit. No channel activity
    observed in heterologous systems. May need to associate with
    another protein to form a functional channel.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain-specific. Highly expressed in auditory
    nuclei, in Purkinje cells and in olfactory bulb mitral cells.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the two pore domain potassium channel
    (TC 1.A.1.8) family.
