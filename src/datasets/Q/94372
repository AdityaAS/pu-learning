AC   Q8ZFR4;
Lipoprotein-releasing system ATP-binding protein lolD (EC 3.6.3.-).
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague.";
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis KIM.";
"Complete genome sequence of Yersinia pestis strain 91001, an isolate
avirulent to humans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex lolCDE involved in
    the translocation of mature outer membrane-directed lipoproteins,
    from the inner membrane to the periplasmic chaperone, lolA.
    Responsible for the formation of the lolA-lipoprotein complex in
    an ATP-dependent manner (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (lolD) and two transmembrane proteins (lolC and lolE) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. Lipoprotein
    translocase (TC 3.A.1.125) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
