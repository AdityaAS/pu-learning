AC   O52619;
Nodulation protein J.
"Nucleotide sequence of nodIJ region of Rhizobium meliloti pSymA.";
"Nucleotide sequence and predicted functions of the entire
Sinorhizobium meliloti pSymA megaplasmid.";
-!- FUNCTION: Forms, with nodI, a membrane transport complex involved
    in the nodulation process. It probably exports a modified beta-
    1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharide.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC-2 integral membrane protein family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-2 domain.
