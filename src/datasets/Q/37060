Cytochrome c2.
"Cytochrome c2 of Rhodospirillum rubrum. II. Complete amino acid
sequence and phylogenetic relationships.";
"The structure of oxidized cytochrome c2 of Rhodospirillum rubrum.";
"Atomic coordinates for ferricytochrome c2 of Rhodospirillum rubrum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome c2 is found mainly in purple, non-sulfur,
    photosynthetic bacteria where it functions as the electron donor
    to the oxidized bacteriochlorophyll in the photophosphorylation
    pathway. However, it may also have a role in the respiratory chain
    and is found in some non-photosynthetic bacteria.
-!- PTM: Binds 1 heme group per subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c family.
