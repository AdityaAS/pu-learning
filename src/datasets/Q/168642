Solute carrier family 12 member 7 (Electroneutral potassium-chloride
cotransporter 4) (K-Cl cotransporter 4).
"Cloning and characterization of KCC3 and KCC4, new members of the
cation-chloride cotransporter gene family.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Characterization of long cDNA clones from human adult spleen.";
"Functional comparison of the K+-Cl- cotransporters KCC1 and KCC4.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates electroneutral potassium-chloride cotransport
    when activated by cell swelling. May mediate K(+) uptake into
    Deiters' cells in the cochlea and contribute to K+ recycling in
    the inner ear. Important for the survival of cochlear outer and
    inner hair cells and the maintenance of the organ of Corti. May be
    required for basolateral Cl(-) extrusion in the kidney and
    contribute to renal acidification (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homomultimer and heteromultimer with other K-Cl
    cotransporters (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q9Y666-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q9Y666-2; Sequence=VSP_006119, VSP_006120;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Detected in muscle, brain, lung, heart and
    kidney.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Activated by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Inhibited by
    furosemide, DIDS and bumetanide. The inhibition is much stronger
    in the presence of 50 mM K+ in the uptake medium. Inhibited by
    DIOA.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLC12A transporter family.
