AC   P56318;
Photosystem Q(B) protein (32 kDa thylakoid membrane protein)
(Photosystem II protein D1).
"Complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genome from the green
alga Chlorella vulgaris: the existence of genes possibly involved in
chloroplast division.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the two reaction center proteins of the
    chloroplast photosystem II.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Herbicides such as atrazine, BNT, diuron or ioxynil
    bind to Q(B) and blocks the electron transport.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the reaction center pufL/M/psbA/D family.
