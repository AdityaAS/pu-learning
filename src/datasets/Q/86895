AC   Q96L42;
Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 8 (Voltage-gated
potassium channel subunit Kv12.1) (Ether-a-go-go-like potassium
channel 3) (ELK channel 3) (ELK3) (ELK1) (hElk1).
"A novel membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent dye improves cell-
based assays for ion channels.";
"Distribution and functional properties of human KCNH8 (Elk1)
potassium channels.";
-!- FUNCTION: Pore-forming (alpha) subunit of voltage-gated potassium
    channel. Elicits a slowly activating, outward rectifying current.
    Channel properties may be modulated by cAMP and subunit assembly.
-!- SUBUNIT: The potassium channel is probably composed of a homo- or
    heterotetrameric complex of pore-forming alpha subunits that can
    associate with modulating beta subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Primarily expressed in the nervous system.
-!- DOMAIN: The segment S4 is probably the voltage-sensor and is
    characterized by a series of positively charged amino acids at
    every third position.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potassium channel family. H (Eag)
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 cyclic nucleotide-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PAC (PAS-associated C-terminal) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domain.
