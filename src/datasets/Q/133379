AC   P24625;
Photosystem Q(B) protein (32 kDa thylakoid membrane protein)
(Photosystem II protein D1).
"Structural similarities between psbA genes from red and brown
algae.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the two reaction center proteins of the
    photosystem II.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Herbicides such as atrazine, BNT, diuron or ioxynil
    bind to Q(B) and blocks the electron transport.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the reaction center pufL/M/psbA/D family.
