AC   Q9LVK9;
Putative phospholipid-transporting ATPase 7 (EC 3.6.3.1)
(Aminophospholipid flippase 7).
"Structural analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 3. I. Sequence
features of the regions of 4,504,864 bp covered by sixty P1 and TAC
clones.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in transport of phospholipids (Potential).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O = ADP + phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cation transport ATPase (P-type)
    family. Type IV subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
