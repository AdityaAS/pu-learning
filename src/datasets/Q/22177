AC   P0C1F7; P52224;
Heme exporter protein D (Cytochrome c-type biogenesis protein ccmD).
"A chromosomal locus required for copper resistance, competitive
fitness, and cytochrome c biogenesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the export of heme to the periplasm for the
    biogenesis of c-type cytochromes (Potential).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ccmD/cycX/helD family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (AAC44225) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 26. This frameshift fuses together ccmD
    and ccmE.
