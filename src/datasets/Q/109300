Diheme cytochrome c napB precursor.
"Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae
Rd.";
"Overproduction, purification and novel redox properties of the dihaem
cytochrome c, NapB, from Haemophilus influenzae.";
"Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the recombinant
dihaem cytochrome c (NapB) from Haemophilus influenzae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Small subunit of the periplasmic nitrate reductase
    (NAP). Only expressed at high levels during aerobic growth. NapAB
    complex receives electrons from the membrane-anchored tetraheme
    napC protein, thus allowing electron flow between membrane and
    periplasm. Essential function for nitrate assimilation and may
    have a role in anaerobic metabolism (By similarity).
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Redox potential:
      E(0) are -25 mV and -175 mV;
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a catalytic subunit and a cytochrome c (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Binds 2 heme groups per subunit.
