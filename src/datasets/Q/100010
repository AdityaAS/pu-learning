AC   P46492;
Probable D-methionine transport system permease protein metI.
"Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae
Rd.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the binding-protein-dependent transport system
    for D-methionine. Probably responsible for the translocation of
    the substrate across the membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the binding-protein-dependent transport
    system permease family. CysTW subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transmembrane type-1 domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 179.
