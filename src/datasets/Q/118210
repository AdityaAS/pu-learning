AC   Q5PKD5;
Porin ompL precursor.
"Comparison of genome degradation in Paratyphi A and Typhi, human-
restricted serovars of Salmonella enterica that cause typhoid.";
-!- FUNCTION: Outer membrane channel protein that allows an efficient
    diffusion of low-molecular-weight solutes such as small sugars and
    tetraglycine. However, the specific substrate recognized by the
    ompL channel is unknown (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the oligogalacturonate-specific porin kdgM
    (TC 1.B.35) family. OmpL subfamily.
