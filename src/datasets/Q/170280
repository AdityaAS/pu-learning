AC   P60268;
Insectotoxin-I3 (BeI3).
"Purification and partial characterization of a 'short' insectotoxin-
like peptide from the venom of the scorpion Parabuthus schlechteri.";
-!- FUNCTION: Chloride channel ligand. Blocks small-conductance
    chloride channels (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The protein sequence was deduced by comparison to
    other short insectotoxin sequences.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the short scorpion toxin superfamily.
    Chloride channel inhibitor family.
Chloride channel inhibitor; Direct protein sequencing;
Ionic channel inhibitor; Neurotoxin; Toxin.
