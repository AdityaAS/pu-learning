-!- FUNCTION: NMDA receptor subtype of glutamate-gated ion channels
    possesses high calcium permeability and voltage-dependent
    sensitivity to magnesium. Mediated by glycine. Plays a key role in
    synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, excitotoxicity, memory
    acquisition and learning. It mediates neuronal functions in
    glutamate neurotransmission. Is involved in the cell surface
    targeting of NMDA receptors.
-!- SUBUNIT: Form heteromeric channel of a zeta subunit (GRIN1), a
    epsilon subunit (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C or GRIN2D) and a third
    subunit (GRIN3A or GRIN3B); disulfide-linked (By similarity).
    Found in a complex with GRIN2A or GRIN2B, GRIN3A and PPP2CB. Found
    in a complex with GRIN2A or GRIN2B and GRIN3B (By similarity).
    Interacts with DLG4 and MPDZ.

-!- PTM: NMDA is probably regulated by C-terminal phosphorylation of
    an isoform of NR1 by PKC. Dephosphorylated on Ser-897 probably by
    protein phosphatase 2A (PPP2CB). Its phosphorylated state is
    influenced by the formation of the NMDAR-PPP2CB complex and the
    NMDAR channel activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glutamate-gated ion channel (TC 1.A.10)
    family.
