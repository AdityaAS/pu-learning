AC   Q8XZP8;
Sulfate/thiosulfate import ATP-binding protein cysA (EC 3.6.3.25)
(Sulfate-transporting ATPase).
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the ABC transporter complex cysAWTP involved in
    sulfate/thiosulfate import. Responsible for energy coupling to the
    transport system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + sulfate(Out) = ADP + phosphate +
    sulfate(In).
-!- SUBUNIT: The complex is composed of two ATP-binding proteins
    (cysA), two transmembrane proteins (cysT and cysW) and a solute-
    binding protein (cysP) (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family.
    Sulfate/tungstate importer (TC 3.A.1.6) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ABC transporter domain.
