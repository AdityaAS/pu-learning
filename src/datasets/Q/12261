AC   P05028;
Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1 (Sodium/potassium-
dependent ATPase beta-1 subunit).
"Amino-acid sequence of the beta-subunit of the (Na+ + K+)ATPase
deduced from a cDNA.";
"Identification of antigenic sites on the Na+/K(+)-ATPase beta-
subunit: their sequences and the effects of thiol reduction upon their
structure.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is the non-catalytic component of the active
    enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the
    exchange of Na(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane. The
    beta subunit regulates, through assembly of alpha/beta
    heterodimers, the number of sodium pumps transported to the plasma
    membrane.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of three subunits: alpha (catalytic), beta and
    gamma.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Na+/K+ and H+/K+ ATPases subunit beta
    family.
