AC   P02911;
Lysine-arginine-ornithine-binding periplasmic protein precursor (LAO-
binding protein).
"Two periplasmic transport proteins which interact with a common
membrane receptor show extensive homology: complete nucleotide
sequences.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Crystal structure of the lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding
protein (LAO) from Salmonella typhimurium at 2.7-A resolution.";
"Three-dimensional structures of the periplasmic
lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding protein with and without a ligand.";
-!- FUNCTION: This periplasmic binding protein is involved in an
    arginine transport system. ArgT and histidine-binding protein J
    (hisJ) interact with a common membrane-bound receptor, hisP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial solute-binding protein 3
    family.
