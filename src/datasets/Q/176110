AC   Q5RBR1;
Signal recognition particle 19 kDa protein (SRP19).
-!- FUNCTION: Signal-recognition-particle assembly, binds directly to
    7S RNA and mediates binding of the 54 kDa subunit of the SRP (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Signal recognition particle consists of a 7S RNA molecule
    of 300 nucleotides and six protein subunits: SRP72, SRP68, SRP54,
    SRP19, SRP14 and SRP9 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SRP19 family.
Ribonucleoprotein; RNA-binding; Signal recognition particle.
