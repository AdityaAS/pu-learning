AC   Q7WL33;
30S ribosomal protein S18.
"Comparative analysis of the genome sequences of Bordetella pertussis,
Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds as a heterodimer with protein S6 to the central
    domain of the 16S rRNA, where it helps stabilize the platform of
    the 30S subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Forms a tight
    heterodimer with protein S6 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S18P family.
