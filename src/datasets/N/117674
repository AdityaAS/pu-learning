2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase E1 component (EC 1.2.4.2) (Alpha-
ketoglutarate dehydrogenase).
"Mechanisms of evolution in Rickettsia conorii and R. prowazekii.";
-!- FUNCTION: The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the
    overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA and CO(2). It
    contains multiple copies of three enzymatic components: 2-
    oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide
    succinyltransferase (E2) and lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-oxoglutarate + [dihydrolipoyllysine-residue
    succinyltransferase] lipoyllysine = [dihydrolipoyllysine-residue
    succinyltransferase] S-succinyldihydrolipoyllysine + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Thiamine pyrophosphate (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
