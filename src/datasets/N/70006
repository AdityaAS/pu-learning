Histone H3, embryonic.
"Histone genes in three sea star species: cluster arrangement,
transcriptional polarity, and analyses of the flanking regions of H3
and H4 genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and
    compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the
    cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones
    thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA
    repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA
    accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational
    modifications of histones, also called histone code, and
    nucleosome remodelling.
-!- SUBUNIT: The nucleosome is a histone octamer containing two
    molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 assembled in one H3-H4
    heterotetramer and two H2A-H2B heterodimers. The octamer wraps
    approximately 147 bp of DNA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: This histone is expressed during late
    embryonic development.
-!- PTM: Acetylation is generally linked to gene activation (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: Methylation at Lys-4 is linked to gene activation.
    Methylation at Lys-9 is linked to gene repression (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the histone H3 family.
