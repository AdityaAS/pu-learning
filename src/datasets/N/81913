Gastrotropin (GT) (Ileal lipid-binding protein) (ILBP) (Intestinal 15
kDa protein) (I-15P) (14 kDa bile acid-binding protein) (I-BABP).
"Cloning of a cDNA encoding rat intestinal 15 kDa protein and its
tissue distribution.";
"Molecular cloning, tissue distribution, and expression of a 14-kDa
bile acid-binding protein from rat ileal cytosol.";
"Primary structure of a 15-kDa protein from rat intestinal epithelium.

"Identification of the 14 kDa bile acid transport protein of rat ileal
cytosol as gastrotropin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Ileal protein which stimulates gastric acid and
    pepsinogen secretion. Seems to be able to bind to bile salts and
    bilirubins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fatty-acid binding protein (FABP)
    family.
