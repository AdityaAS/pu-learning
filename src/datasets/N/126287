AC   P61429;
Periplasmic [NiFe] hydrogenase small subunit 2 precursor (EC 1.12.2.1)
(NiFe hydrogenlyase small chain 2).
"The genome sequence of the anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacterium
Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 H(2) + ferricytochrome c3 = 4 H(+) +
    ferrocytochrome c3.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 3Fe-4S cluster (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 4Fe-4S clusters (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a large and a small subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Predicted to be exported by the Tat system. The position of
    the signal peptide cleavage has not been experimentally proven.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the [NiFe]/[NiFeSe] hydrogenase small
    subunit family.
