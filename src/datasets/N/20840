AC   Q2QL88;
F-actin capping protein alpha-2 subunit (CapZ alpha-2).
"NISC comparative sequencing initiative.";
-!- FUNCTION: F-actin capping proteins bind in a Ca(2+)-independent
    manner to the fast growing ends of actin filaments (barbed end)
    thereby blocking the exchange of subunits at these ends. Unlike
    other capping proteins (such as gelsolin and severin), these
    proteins do not sever actin filaments (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the F-actin capping protein alpha subunit
    family.
Actin capping; Actin-binding.
