AC   Q92J82;
Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.12) (Aspartate--tRNA ligase)
(AspRS).
"Mechanisms of evolution in Rickettsia conorii and R. prowazekii.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-aspartate + tRNA(Asp) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-aspartyl-tRNA(Asp).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
