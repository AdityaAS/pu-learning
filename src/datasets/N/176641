-!- FUNCTION: Protein phosphatase which regulates actin filament
    dynamics. Dephosphorylates and activates the actin
    binding/depolymerizing factor cofilin, which subsequently binds to
    actin filaments and stimulates their disassembly. Inhibitory
    phosphorylation of cofilin is mediated by LIMK1, which may also be
    dephosphorylated and inactivated by this protein.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein tyrosine phosphate + H(2)O = protein
    tyrosine + phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A phosphoprotein + H(2)O = a protein +
    phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with actin and this stimulates phosphatase
    activity. Also interacts with LIMK1 and with the 14-3-3 proteins
    YWHAB, YWHAG, YWHAQ, and YWHAZ. Interaction with 14-3-3 proteins
    inhibits phosphatase activity and also blocks recruitment to
    lamellipodia and stimulation by actin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Note=Also recruited to actin rich
    membrane protrusions such as lamellipodia, which may allow local
    control of actin dynamics at sites of cell locomotion. Also
    localized to the cleavage furrow and the midbody during
    cytokinesis.

-!- PTM: Phosphorylated. Inhibitory phosphorylation by PAK4 promotes
    binding to YWHAZ. Phosphorylation at Ser-978 is decreased by
    stimuli which promote actin reorganization and lamellipodia
    formation. Can be dephosphorylated and activated by
    PPP3CA/calcineurin A. Phosphorylation decreases immediately prior
    to telophase.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Tyrosine phosphatase activity has not been
    demonstrated for this protein to date.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 tyrosine-protein phosphatase domain.
