-!- FUNCTION: Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and
    compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the
    cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones
    thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA
    repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA
    accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational
    modifications of histones, also called histone code, and
    nucleosome remodelling.
-!- SUBUNIT: The nucleosome is a histone octamer containing two
    molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 assembled in one H3-H4
    heterotetramer and two H2A-H2B heterodimers. The octamer wraps
    approximately 147 bp of DNA.

-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- PTM: Acetylated on Lys-5 and Lys-12 during prophase I of meiosis.
    Phosphorylation of H2A 'Thr-119' is a prerequisite for H4 Lys-5
    acetylation but not for H4 Lys-12 acetylation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the histone H4 family.
