alpha) (ACCase subunit alpha).

-!- FUNCTION: Component of the acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC)
    complex. First, biotin carboxylase catalyzes the carboxylation of
    biotin on its carrier protein (BCCP) and then the CO(2) group is
    transferred by the carboxyltransferase to acetyl-CoA to form
    malonyl-CoA (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + acetyl-CoA + HCO(3)(-) = ADP + phosphate
    + malonyl-CoA.
-!- PATHWAY: Long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis; first step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is an heterohexamer composed of
    biotin carboxyl carrier protein (accB), biotin carboxylase (accC)
    and two subunits each of ACCase subunit alpha (accA) and ACCase
    subunit beta (accD) (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the accA family.
