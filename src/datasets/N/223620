"Genome sequence of Shigella flexneri 2a: insights into pathogenicity
through comparison with genomes of Escherichia coli K12 and O157.";
"Complete genome sequence and comparative genomics of Shigella
flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involves in the regulation of cellulose production (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Bacterial cellulose biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 GGDEF domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to a stop
    codon at position 61 which was translated as Gln to extend the
    sequence.
-!- CAUTION: Could be the product of a pseudogene.
