Serine/threonine-protein kinase plk-1 (EC 2.7.11.21) (Polo-like kinase
1).
"Caenorhabditis elegans contains structural homologs of human prk and
plk.";
"The polo-like kinase PLK-1 is required for nuclear envelope breakdown
and the completion of meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans.";
"2.2 Mb of contiguous nucleotide sequence from chromosome III of C.
elegans.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for oocyte nuclear envelope breakdown before
    entry of oocyte into spermatheca. In mitotic cells, plays a role
    in spindle organization and centrosome maturation. In meiotic
    cells, required for spindle dynamics and probably for spindle
    attachment to the chromosomes. Zygotic role in the development of
    the germline and nerve cord.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- INTERACTION:
    O61708:pqn-59; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-315211, EBI-315255;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Centrosome. Cytoplasm. Note=In mitosis,
    remains associated with centrosomes entering prophase through to
    anaphase. During metaphase, found at the chromosomes of the
    metaphase plate. In meiosis, detected at centrosomes after
    pronuclear meeting in post-meiotic 1-cell embryos. Associated with
    chromatin during chromosome segregation of anaphase and in the
    region between the dividing chromosomes. Cytoplasmic in mature,
    unfertilized oocytes.
