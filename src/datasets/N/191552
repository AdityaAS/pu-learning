AC   P33907;
Autoinducer synthesis protein traI.
"TraI, a LuxI homologue, is responsible for production of conjugation
factor, the Ti plasmid N-acylhomoserine lactone autoinducer.";
"Genetic and sequence analysis of the pTiC58 trb locus, encoding a
mating-pair formation system related to members of the type IV
secretion family.";
"The genome of the natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens
C58.";
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen and biotechnology agent
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the synthesis of OHHL (N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-
    homoserine lactone), an autoinducer molecule which binds to traR
    and thus acts in the control of conjugal transfer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the autoinducer synthetase family.
