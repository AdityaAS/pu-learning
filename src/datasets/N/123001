AC   Q9QXQ1;
cAMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase 7B (EC 3.1.4.17).
"Cloning and characterization of PDE7B, a cAMP-specific
phosphodiesterase.";
"Cloning and characterisation of the human and mouse PDE7B, a novel
cAMP-specific nucleotide phosphodiesterase.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in the control of cAMP-mediated neural
    activity and cAMP metabolism in the brain.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate + H(2)O =
    adenosine 5'-phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Divalent cations (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by dipyridamole, IBMX and SCH 51866.
    Insensitive to zaprinast, rolipram, and milrinone.
-!- PATHWAY: Cyclic nucleotide metabolism.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in brain.
-!- DOMAIN: Composed of a C-terminal catalytic domain containing two
    putative divalent metal sites and an N-terminal regulatory domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase
    family.
