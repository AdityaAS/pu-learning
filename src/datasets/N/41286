-!- FUNCTION: Production of cholesterol by reduction of C7-C8 double
    bond of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cholesterol + NADP(+) = cholesta-5,7-dien-3-
    beta-ol + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Cholesterol biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ERG4/ERG24 family.
