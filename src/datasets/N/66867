AC   Q9N2J2;
Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, mitochondrial
precursor (EC 1.11.1.12) (PHGPx) (Glutathione peroxidase 4) (GPx-4).
"Bovine phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Could play a major role in protecting mammals from the
    toxicity of ingested lipid hydroperoxides. Essential for embryonic
    development. Protects from radiation and oxidative damage (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 glutathione + a lipid hydroperoxide =
    glutathione disulfide + lipid + 2 H(2)O.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion (By similarity). Cytoplasm (By
    similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative initiation; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Mitochondrial;
      IsoId=Q9N2J2-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Cytoplasmic;
      IsoId=Q9N2J2-2; Sequence=VSP_018738;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glutathione peroxidase family.
