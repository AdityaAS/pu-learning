-!- FUNCTION: Cleaves Arg-Arg-beta-naphthylamide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Release of an N-terminal dipeptide from a
    peptide comprising four or more residues, with broad specificity.
    Also acts on dipeptidyl 2-naphthylamides.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 8.8;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q9NY33-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q9NY33-2; Sequence=VSP_005510;
      Note=May be produced at very low levels due to a premature stop
      codon in the mRNA, leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. No
      experimental confirmation available;
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=82500; MW_ERR=60; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=1-737
    (Q9NY33-1); NOTE=Ref.5.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M49 family.
