Chitinase 3-like protein 2 precursor (YKL-39) (Chondrocyte protein
39).
"Cloning of a novel lymphoid restricted human chitinase and
localization to 1p13.3.";
"Isolation and sequence of a novel human chondrocyte protein related
to mammalian members of the chitinase protein family.";
-!- FUNCTION: May bind glycan structure with high affinity, but not
    heparin. Has no chitotriosidase activity.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highest expression in chondrocytes, followed
    by synoviocytes, lung and heart. Not detected in spleen, pancreas,
    and liver. May also be expressed in developing brain and placenta.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 18 family.
