AC   Q86SD9;
Alpha-neurotoxin 3 precursor (AamH3).
"Isolation of scorpion (Androctonus amoreuxi) putative alpha
neurotoxins and parallel cloning of their respective cDNAs from a
single sample of venom.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to sodium channels and inhibits the inactivation
    of the activated channels, thereby blocking neuronal transmission.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- PTM: The C-terminal basic residue is removed by a
    carboxypeptidase.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the long (4 C-C) scorpion toxin
    superfamily. Sodium channel inhibitor family. Alpha subfamily.
Direct protein sequencing; Ionic channel inhibitor; Neurotoxin;
Signal; Sodium channel inhibitor; Toxin.
