AC   Q9LCQ4;
Chaperone protein dnaJ.
"Molecular cloning of the dnaK locus, and purification and
characterization of a DnaK protein from Bacillus brevis HPD31.";
-!- FUNCTION: Participates actively in the response to hyperosmotic
    and heat shock by preventing the aggregation of stress-denatured
    proteins and by disaggregating proteins, also in an autonomous,
    dnaK-independent fashion. Unfolded proteins bind initially to
    dnaJ; upon interaction with the dnaJ-bound protein, dnaK
    hydrolyzes its bound ATP, resulting in the formation of a stable
    complex. GrpE releases ADP from dnaK; ATP binding to dnaK triggers
    the release of the substrate protein, thus completing the reaction
    cycle. Several rounds of ATP-dependent interactions between dnaJ,
    dnaK and grpE are required for fully efficient folding. Also
    involved, together with dnaK and grpE, in the DNA replication of
    plasmids through activation of initiation proteins (By
    similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 zinc ions per monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- DOMAIN: The J domain is necessary and sufficient to stimulate dnaK
    ATPase activity. Zinc center 1 plays an important role in the
    autonomous, dnaK-independent chaperone activity of dnaJ. Zinc
    center 2 is essential for interaction with dnaK and for dnaJ
    activity (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dnaJ family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CR-type zinc finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 J domain.
