AC   Q6FKS8;
ATP-dependent rRNA helicase SPB4 (EC 3.6.1.-).
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: ATP-binding RNA helicase involved in the biogenesis of
    60S ribosomal subunits. Required for the normal formation of 18S
    rRNA through the processing of pre-rRNAs at sites A0, A1 and A2,
    and the normal formation of 25S and 5.8S rRNAs through the
    processing of pre-rRNAs at sites C1 and C2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nucleolus (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The Q motif is unique to and characteristic of the DEAD
    box family of RNA helicases and controls ATP binding and
    hydrolysis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DEAD box helicase family. DDX55/SPB4
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase C-terminal domain.
