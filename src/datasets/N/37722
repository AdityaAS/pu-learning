reductase, thioredoxin dependent) (PAdoPS reductase) (3'-
phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase) (PAPS sulfotransferase).
"Genome sequence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus: a pathogenic mechanism
distinct from that of V. cholerae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Reduction of activated sulfate into sulfite.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + sulfite +
    thioredoxin disulfide = 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + thioredoxin.
-!- PATHWAY: Sulfur metabolism; hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis; sulfite
    from sulfate: step 3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PAPS reductase family. CysH subfamily.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Complete proteome; Cysteine biosynthesis;
Oxidoreductase.
