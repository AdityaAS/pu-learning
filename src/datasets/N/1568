"DISTORTED3/SCAR2 is a putative Arabidopsis WAVE complex subunit that
activates the Arp2/3 complex and is required for epidermal
morphogenesis.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 3 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Functional annotation of a full-length Arabidopsis cDNA collection.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in regulation of actin and microtubule
    organization. Part of a WAVE complex that activates the Arp2/3
    complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds SCAR (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABI family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 sequence might be the product of an alternative
    splicing.
