AC   P42699; Q9LN26;
Plastocyanin major isoform, chloroplast precursor (DNA-damage-
repair/toleration protein DRT112).
"Two cDNAs from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana that partially restore
recombination proficiency and DNA-damage resistance to E. coli mutants
lacking recombination-intermediate-resolution activities.";
"A peroxidase homologue and novel plastocyanin located by proteomics
to the Arabidopsis chloroplast thylakoid lumen.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Participates in electron transfer between P700 and the
    cytochrome b6-f complex in photosystem I. Seems to be the major
    plastocyanin in Arabidopsis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    lumen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 plastocyanin-like domain.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) thought to be involved in the
    resistance to UV light and chemical DNA-damaging agents.
