-!- FUNCTION: This bifunctional enzyme catalyzes two consecutive
    reactions converting 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide to 3'-nucleotide and
    then 3'-nucleotide to nucleic acid and phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphate + H(2)O =
    nucleoside 3'-phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Divalent cations (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Two kinetically distinguishable active sites for
    two corresponding substrates can be identified.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 5'-nucleotidase family.
