AC   Q4L6M4;
Probable exodeoxyribonuclease VII large subunit (EC 3.1.11.6)
(Exonuclease VII large subunit).
"Whole-genome sequencing of Staphylococcus haemolyticus uncovers the
extreme plasticity of its genome and the evolution of human-colonizing
staphylococcal species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Bidirectionally degrades single-stranded DNA into large
    acid-insoluble oligonucleotides, which are then degraded further
    into small acid-soluble oligonucleotides (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Exonucleolytic cleavage in either 5'- to 3'-
    or 3'- to 5'-direction to yield nucleoside 5'-phosphates.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooligomer composed of large and small subunits (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the xseA family.
Complete proteome; Exonuclease; Hydrolase; Nuclease.
