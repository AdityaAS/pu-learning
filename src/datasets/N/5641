AC   Q6C3K2;
Chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol beta-mannosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.142)
(GDP-mannose-dolichol diphosphochitobiose mannosyltransferase) (GDP-
Man:GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol mannosyltransferase) (Beta-1,4-
mannosyltransferase) (Asparagine-linked glycosylation protein 1).
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Participates in the formation of the lipid-linked
    precursor oligosaccharide for N-glycosylation. Involved in
    assembling the dolichol-pyrophosphate-GlcNAc(2)-Man(5)
    intermediate on the cytoplasmic surface of the ER (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: GDP-mannose + chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol =
    GDP + beta-1,4-D-mannosylchitobiosyldiphosphodolichol.
-!- PATHWAY: N-glycosylation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 1 family.
