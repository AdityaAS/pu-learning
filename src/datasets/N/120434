Phospholipase A2 isozyme 1 precursor (EC 3.1.1.4) (Phospholipase A2
isozyme I) (Phosphatidylcholine 2-acylhydrolase) (GL5-1).
"A comparative analysis of invaded sequences from group IA
phospholipase A(2) genes provides evidence about the divergence period
of genes groups and snake families.";
"Amino acid sequences of three phospholipases A I, III and IV from the
venom of the sea snake Laticauda semifasciata.";
"Correction of amino acid sequence of phospholipase A2 I from the
venom of Laticauda semifasciata (Erabu sea snake).";
-!- FUNCTION: PA2 catalyzes the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of the 2-
    acyl groups in 3-sn-phosphoglycerides.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphatidylcholine + H(2)O = 1-
    acylglycerophosphocholine + a carboxylate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phospholipase A2 family.
