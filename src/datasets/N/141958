Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain 6, chloroplast precursor
(EC 4.1.1.39) (RuBisCO small subunit 6).
"The six genes of the Rubisco small subunit multigene family from
Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, a facultative CAM plant.";
-!- FUNCTION: RuBisCO catalyzes two reactions: the carboxylation of D-
    ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, the primary event in carbon dioxide
    fixation, as well as the oxidative fragmentation of the pentose
    substrate. Both reactions occur simultaneously and in competition
    at the same active site (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate + CO(2) + H(2)O =
    2 3-phospho-D-glycerate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate + O(2) = 3-
    phospho-D-glycerate + 2-phosphoglycolate.
-!- SUBUNIT: 8 large chains + 8 small chains.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RuBisCO small chain family.
