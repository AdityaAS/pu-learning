AC   Q729U6;
Chromosomal replication initiator protein dnaA.
"The genome sequence of the anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacterium
Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays an important role in the initiation and regulation
    of chromosomal replication. Binds to the origin of replication; it
    binds specifically double-stranded DNA at a 9 bp consensus (dnaA
    box): 5'-TTATC[CA]A[CA]A-3'. DnaA binds to ATP and to acidic
    phospholipids (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dnaA family.
ATP-binding; Complete proteome; DNA replication; DNA-binding;
Nucleotide-binding.
