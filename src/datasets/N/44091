"Cloning of the DNA polymerase gene of Bacillus caldotenax and
characterization of the gene product.";
-!- FUNCTION: In addition to polymerase activity, this DNA polymerase
    exhibits 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' exonuclease activity.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
