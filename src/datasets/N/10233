AC   P12421;
3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.19) (5-
enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) (EPSP synthase) (EPSPS).
"Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the aroA gene of Bordetella
pertussis.";
"Comparative analysis of the genome sequences of Bordetella pertussis,
Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphoenolpyruvate + 3-phosphoshikimate =
    phosphate + 5-O-(1-carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshikimate.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; chorismate
