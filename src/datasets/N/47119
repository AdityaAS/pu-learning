Elongation factor 1-delta 2 (EF-1-delta 2) (Elongation factor 1B-beta
2) (eEF-1B beta 2).
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 2 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
"Full-length cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana.";
-!- FUNCTION: EF-1-beta and EF-1-delta stimulate the exchange of GDP
    bound to EF-1-alpha to GTP (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: EF-1 is composed of 4 subunits: alpha, beta (1B-
    alpha=beta'), delta (1B-beta), and gamma (1B-gamma) (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the EF-1-beta/EF-1-delta family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 GST-like domain.
