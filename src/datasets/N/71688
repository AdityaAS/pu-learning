AC   P56823;
Hemocyanin, beta-C chain unit G (Fragment).
"Amino-acid sequence of the N-terminal part of the functional unit g
of beta-c-haemocyanin of the mollusc Helix pomatia.";
"Amino-acid sequence of functional unit g from the beta-c-haemocyanin
of Helix pomatia.";
"Evidence for a cysteine-histidine thioether bridge in functional
units of molluscan haemocyanins and location of the disulfide bridges
in functional units d and g of the beta-c-haemocyanin of Helix
pomatia.";
-!- FUNCTION: Hemocyanins are copper-containing oxygen carriers
    occurring freely dissolved in the hemolymph of many mollusks and
    arthropods.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 copper ions per heterodimer.
-!- SUBUNIT: Decamers of large identical subunits (450 kDa), each
    containing 8 globular oxygen-binding functional units.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tyrosinase family. Hemocyanin
    subfamily.
