AC   P35142;
Small, acid-soluble spore protein gamma-type (SASP).
"A gene encoding a small, acid-soluble spore protein from alkaliphilic
Bacillus firmus OF4.";
-!- FUNCTION: SASP are proteins degraded in the first minutes of spore
    germination and provide amino acids for both new protein synthesis
    and metabolism. These proteins may be involved in dormant spore's
    high resistance to UV light.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gamma-type SASP family.
Sporulation.
