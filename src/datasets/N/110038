AC   Q63689;
Neurogenic differentiation factor 2 (NeuroD2) (Brain bHLH protein
KW8).
"Molecular cloning of a novel basic helix-loop-helix protein from the
rat brain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Appears to mediate neuronal differentiation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Efficient DNA binding requires dimerization with another
    bHLH protein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Detected only in neural tissue.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to frameshifts
    in positions 225 and 250.
Developmental protein; Differentiation; DNA-binding; Nuclear protein;
