-!- FUNCTION: Acid protease active in intracellular protein breakdown.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Specificity similar to, but narrower than,
    that of pepsin A. Does not cleave the 4-Gln-|-His-5 bond in B
    chain of insulin.
-!- SUBUNIT: Consists of a light chain and a heavy chain.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Lysosome.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase A1 family.
