AC   Q9UZ61;
Cell division protein ftsZ homolog 2.
"An integrated analysis of the genome of the hyperthermophilic
archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is essential to the cell-division process.
    It seems to assemble into a dynamic ring on the inner surface of
    the cytoplasmic membrane at the place where division will occur,
    and the formation of the ring is the signal for septation to
    begin. Binds to and hydrolyzes GTP (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Aggregates to form a ring-like structure (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ftsZ family.
Cell cycle; Cell division; Complete proteome; GTP-binding;
