-!- FUNCTION: Binds the lower part of the 30S subunit head. Binds mRNA
    in the 70S ribosome, positioning it for translation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Forms a tight complex
    with proteins S10 and S14.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=26570; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=1-238;
    NOTE=Ref.3.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S3P family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 KH type-2 domain.
