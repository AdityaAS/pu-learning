-!- FUNCTION: CBF binds to the core site, 5'-PYGPYGGT-3', of a number
    of enhancers and promoters, including murine leukemia virus,
    polyomavirus enhancer, T-cell receptor enhancers, LCK, IL-3 and
    GM-CSF promoters. CBFB enhances DNA binding by RUNX1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer with RUNX1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Potential).

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in all tissues tested. Highest level
    in thymus, but also abundantly expressed in muscle, lung and
    brain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CBF-beta family.
