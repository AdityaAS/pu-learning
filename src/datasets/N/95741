AC   P05521; P11002;
Acyl transferase (EC 2.3.1.-) (ACT) (Myristoyl-ACP-specific
thioesterase) (C14ACP-TE).
"Organization of the lux structural genes of Vibrio harveyi.
Expression under the T7 bacteriophage promoter, mRNA analysis, and
nucleotide sequence of the luxD gene.";
"Nucleotide sequence of the luxA gene of Vibrio harveyi and the
complete amino acid sequence of the alpha subunit of bacterial
luciferase.";
"Structure of a myristoyl-ACP-specific thioesterase from Vibrio
harveyi.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acyl transferase is part of the fatty acid reductase
    system required for aldehyde biosynthesis; it produces fatty acids
    for the luminescent reaction.
-!- PATHWAY: Bioluminescent fatty acid reduction system; first step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the luxD family.
