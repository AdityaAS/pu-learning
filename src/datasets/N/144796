AC   O43566; O43565; Q8TD62;
Regulator of G-protein signaling 14 (RGS14).
"cDNA clones of human proteins involved in signal transduction
sequenced by the Guthrie cDNA resource center (www.cdna.org).";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase
    activity of G protein alpha subunits thereby driving them into
    their inactive GDP-bound form.
