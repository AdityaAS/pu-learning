N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase sle1 precursor (EC 3.5.1.28).
"The multifunctional Staphylococcus aureus autolysin aaa mediates
adherence to immobilized fibrinogen and fibronectin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Peptidoglycan hydrolase involved in the splitting of the
    septum during cell division. Binds to both alpha and beta-chains
    of human fibrinogen as well as fibronectin, which suggests a role
    in the colonization of host factor-coated material or host tissue.
    Also exhibits lytic activity against S.carnosus and S.aureus cells
    but not against M.luteus cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolyzes the link between N-acetylmuramoyl
    residues and L-amino acid residues in certain cell-wall
    glycopeptides.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell surface.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 LysM repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase C51 domain.
