Growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor precursor (GHRH receptor)
(GRF receptor) (GRFR).
"Structure and functional expression of a complementary DNA for
porcine growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for GRF, coupled to G proteins which activate
    adenylyl cyclase. Stimulates somatotroph cell growth, growth
    hormone gene transcription and growth hormone secretion.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Pituitary gland. Also detected in the
    lymphocytes and thymocytes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 2 family.
