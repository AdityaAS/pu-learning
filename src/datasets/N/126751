AC   Q51518;
Probable isochorismatase (EC 3.3.2.1) (2,3 dihydro-2,3
dihydroxybenzoate synthase).
"Molecular analysis of genes encoding phenazine biosynthesis in the
biological control bacterium. Pseudomonas aureofaciens 30-84.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic
    phenazine, a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic molecule having
    important roles in virulence, competition and biological control.
    This isochorismatase may remove pyruvate from chorismate during
    the formation of the phenazine ring structure and/or stabilize the
    phenazine biosynthetic complex.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Isochorismate + H(2)O = 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-
    dihydrobenzoate + pyruvate.
-!- PATHWAY: Phenazine biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the isochorismatase family.
Antibiotic biosynthesis; Hydrolase; Virulence.
