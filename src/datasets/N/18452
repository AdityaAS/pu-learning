AC   Q64658;
Cytochrome P450 11B2, mitochondrial precursor (EC 1.14.15.4)
(EC 1.14.15.5) (C450XIB2) (Aldosterone synthase) (P-450Aldo) (ALDOS)
(Aldosterone-synthesizing enzyme) (Steroid 18-hydroxylase) (P-450C18).
"The presence of two cytochrome P450 aldosterone synthase mRNAs in the
hamster adrenal.";
"Characterization of the hamster CYP11B2 gene encoding adrenal
cytochrome P450 aldosterone synthase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Converts 11-deoxycorticosterone into corticosterone, 18-
    hydroxycorticosterone, and aldosterone. Also can catalyze the
    conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, 18-hydroxycortisol and
    cortisone (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A steroid + reduced adrenal ferredoxin + O(2)
    = an 11-beta-hydroxysteroid + oxidized adrenal ferredoxin + H(2)O.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Corticosterone + reduced adrenal ferredoxin +
    O(2) = 18-hydroxycorticosterone + oxidized adrenal ferredoxin +
    H(2)O.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Adrenal gland.
-!- INDUCTION: By low sodium intake.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family.
