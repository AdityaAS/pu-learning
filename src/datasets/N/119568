AC   Q9N1U7;
Ornithine carbamoyltransferase, mitochondrial precursor (EC 2.1.3.3)
(OTCase) (Ornithine transcarbamylase).
"Ornithine transcarbamylase is expressed in uricotelic animals.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Carbamoyl phosphate + L-ornithine = phosphate
    + L-citrulline.
-!- PATHWAY: Nitrogen metabolism; urea cycle; L-citrulline from L-
    ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate: single step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial matrix (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATCase/OTCase family.
Acetylation; Amino-acid biosynthesis; Arginine biosynthesis;
Mitochondrion; Transferase; Transit peptide; Urea cycle.
