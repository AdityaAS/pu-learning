Actin, cytoplasmic 1 (Beta-actin).
-!- FUNCTION: Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved
    in various types of cell motility and are ubiquitously expressed
    in all eukaryotic cells.
-!- SUBUNIT: Polymerization of globular actin (G-actin) leads to a
    structural filament (F-actin) in the form of a two-stranded helix.
    Each actin can bind to 4 others. Found in a complex with XPO6,
    Ran, ACTB and PFN1. Interacts with XPO6 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: In vertebrates 3 main groups of actin isoforms,
    alpha, beta and gamma have been identified. The alpha actins are
    found in muscle tissues and are a major constituent of the
    contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins coexist in most
    cell types as components of the cytoskeleton and as mediators of
    internal cell motility.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the actin family.
