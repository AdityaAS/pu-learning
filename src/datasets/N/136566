AC   Q97J93;
Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine cyclo-ligase (EC 6.3.3.1) (AIRS)
(Phosphoribosyl-aminoimidazole synthetase) (AIR synthase).
"Genome sequence and comparative analysis of the solvent-producing
bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 2-(formamido)-1-N-(5-phospho-D-
    ribosyl)acetamidine = ADP + phosphate + 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-
    ribosyl)imidazole.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; IMP biosynthesis; 5-amino-1-(5-
    phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide from 2-N-formyl-1-N-(5-
    phospho-D-ribosyl)glycinamide: step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Purine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the AIR synthase family.
