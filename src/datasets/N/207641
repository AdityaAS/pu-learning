AC   P23101;
Toluate 1,2-dioxygenase electron transfer component [Includes:
Ferredoxin; Ferredoxin--NAD(+) reductase (EC 1.18.1.3)].
"Potential DNA slippage structures acquired during evolutionary
divergence of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus chromosomal benABC and
Pseudomonas putida TOL pWW0 plasmid xylXYZ, genes encoding benzoate
dioxygenases.";
-!- FUNCTION: Electron transfer component of toluate 1,2-dioxygenase
    system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Reduced ferredoxin + NAD(+) = oxidized
    ferredoxin + NADH.
-!- SUBUNIT: This dioxygenase system consists of three proteins: the
    two subunits of the hydroxylase component (xylX and xylY), and an
    electron transfer component (xylZ).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial ring-hydroxylating
    dioxygenase ferredoxin reductase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain.
