-!- DOMAIN: The elongin BC complex binding domain is also known as BC-
    box with the consensus [APST]-L-x(3)-C-x(3)-[AILV].
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 7 LRR (leucine-rich) repeats.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to frameshifts
    in positions 34 and 112.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (CAD97609) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 112 and 164.
-!- CAUTION: The N-terminus was determined according to experiments in
    the mouse.
