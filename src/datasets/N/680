AC   P28334;
5-hydroxytryptamine 1B receptor (5-HT-1B) (Serotonin receptor 1B) (5-
HT1B).
"Mouse 5HT1B serotonin receptor: cloning, functional expression, and
localization in motor control centers.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the several different receptors for 5-
    hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), a biogenic hormone that functions
    as a neurotransmitter, a hormone, and a mitogen. The activity of
    this receptor is mediated by G proteins that inhibit adenylate
    cyclase activity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominantly expressed in striatum and
    Purkinje cells.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Palmitoylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
