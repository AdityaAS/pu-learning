L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase ulaF (EC 5.1.3.4) (Phosphoribulose
isomerase) (L-ascorbate utilization protein F).
"Genome dynamics and diversity of Shigella species, the etiologic
agents of bacillary dysentery.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the isomerization of L-ribulose 5-phosphate to
    D-xylulose 5-phosphate. Is involved in the anaerobic L-ascorbate
    utilization (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-ribulose 5-phosphate = D-xylulose 5-
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (Potential).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; L-ascorbate degradation; D-
    xylulose 5-phosphate from L-ascorbate: step 4 [final step].
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by L-ascorbate. Repressed by ulaR (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aldolase class II family. AraD/fucA
    subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (CP000036) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a stop codon in position 172 which was translated as Trp to extend
    the sequence.
-!- CAUTION: Could be the product of a pseudogene.
