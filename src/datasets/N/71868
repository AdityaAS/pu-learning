AC   Q5T447; Q5T448; Q9H783;
Probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase HECTD3 (HECT domain-containing
protein 3).
"Complete sequencing and characterization of 21,243 full-length human
cDNAs.";
"The DNA sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which accepts
    ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a
    thioester and then directly transfers the ubiquitin to targeted
    substrates (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Ubiquitin conjugation; third step.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q5T447-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q5T447-2; Sequence=VSP_019439, VSP_019440;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
    Name=3;
      IsoId=Q5T447-3; Sequence=VSP_019438;
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 APC10 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HECT (E6AP-type E3 ubiquitin-protein
    ligase) domain.
