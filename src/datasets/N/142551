AC   P14167; Q3M3B4;
Protein recA (Recombinase A).
"Regulation of expression and nucleotide sequence of the Anabaena
variabilis recA gene.";
"Complete sequence of Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413.";
-!- FUNCTION: Can catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of
    single-stranded DNA, the ATP-dependent uptake of single-stranded
    DNA by duplex DNA, and the ATP-dependent hybridization of
    homologous single-stranded DNAs. It interacts with lexA causing
    its activation and leading to its autocatalytic cleavage.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the recA family.
