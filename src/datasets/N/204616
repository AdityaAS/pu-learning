AC   P83839;
Vodo peptide M.
"Primary and 3-D modelled structures of two cyclotides from Viola
odorata.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably participates in a plant defense mechanism.
-!- PTM: This is a cyclic peptide.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=3077; METHOD=Electrospray; RANGE=1-29;
    NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyclotide family. Moebius subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: This peptide is cyclic. The start position was chosen by
    similarity to Oak1 (kalata B1) for which the DNA sequence is
    known.
