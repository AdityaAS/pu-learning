Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 3 (Pre-mRNA-splicing factor
SRP20) (X16 protein).
"A differentially expressed murine RNA encoding a protein with
similarities to two types of nucleic acid binding motifs.";
"Regulated expression and RNA processing of transcripts from the Srp20
splicing factor gene during the cell cycle.";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in RNA processing in relation with
    cellular proliferation and/or maturation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with CPSF6 and SFRS12 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
