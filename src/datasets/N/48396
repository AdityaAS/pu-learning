AC   Q4JB01;
Glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase [NAD(P)] (EC 1.1.1.261) (sn-
glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase) (G-1-P dehydrogenase)
(Enantiomeric glycerophosphate synthase).
"The genome of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, a model organism of the
Crenarchaeota.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the formation of archaea-specific
    glycerophosphate backbone of phospholipids, G-1-P, from
    dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: sn-glycerol-1-phosphate + NAD(P)(+) =
    glycerone phosphate + NAD(P)H.
-!- PATHWAY: De novo phospholipid biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase
    family.
