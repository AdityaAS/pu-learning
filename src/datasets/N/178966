(CysRS 1).
"Complete genome sequence and comparative analysis of the industrial
microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis.";
"Genome sequence of an industrial microorganism Streptomyces
avermitilis: deducing the ability of producing secondary
metabolites.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-cysteine + tRNA(Cys) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-cysteinyl-tRNA(Cys).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
