Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (EC 6.2.1.1) (Acetate--CoA ligase) (Acyl-
activating enzyme).
"Complete genomic sequence of nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacterium
Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110.";
"Identification of active site residues in Bradyrhizobium japonicum
acetyl-CoA synthetase.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + acetate + CoA = AMP + diphosphate +
    acetyl-CoA.
-!- PTM: Acetylated. Deacetylation by the SIR2-homolog deacetylase
    activates the enzyme (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATP-dependent AMP-binding enzyme
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 479.
