30S ribosomal protein S14 type Z.
"Sequence analysis of a 32-kb region including the major ribosomal
protein gene clusters from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125.";
"Complete genome sequence of the alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus
halodurans and genomic sequence comparison with Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds 16S rRNA, required for the assembly of 30S
    particles and may also be responsible for determining the
    conformation of the 16S rRNA at the A site (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts proteins S3
    and S10 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S14P family. Zinc-
    binding S14P subfamily.
