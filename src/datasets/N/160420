AC   Q9KPK1;
Regulator of ribonuclease activity A protein 1.
"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Regulator of RNase E/rne, which inhibits the
    endonuclease activity and thereby leads to increase the half-life
    and abundance of RNAs. General modulator of RNA abundance. Does
    not have any methyltransferase activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer. Interacts with RNase E protein and probably
    inhibits its catalytic activity (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the rraA family.
3D-structure; Complete proteome.
