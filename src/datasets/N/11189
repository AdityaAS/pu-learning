AC   Q9KV60;
3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.10) (3-dehydroquinase) (Type II
DHQase).
"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes a trans-dehydration via an enolate
    intermediate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3-dehydroquinate = 3-dehydroshikimate + H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; chorismate
    biosynthesis; chorismate from D-erythrose 4-phosphate and PEP:
    step 3.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Aromatic amino acids biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homododecamer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type-II 3-dehydroquinase family.
