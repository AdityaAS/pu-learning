AC   P25180;
Hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (EC 3.2.1.18).
"Antigenic and structural properties of a paramyxovirus simian virus
41 (SV41) reveal a close relationship with human parainfluenza type 2
virus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Attaches the virus to sialic acid-containing cell
    receptors and thereby initiating infection. Binding of HN protein
    to the receptor induces a conformational change that allows the F
    protein to trigger virion/cell membranes fusion (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: Neuraminidase activity ensures the efficient spread of
    the virus by dissociating the mature virions from the neuraminic
    acid containing glycoproteins (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of alpha-(2->3)-, alpha-(2->6)-,
    alpha-(2->8)- glycosidic linkages of terminal sialic residues in
    oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, glycolipids, colominic acid and
    synthetic substrates.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the paramyxoviruses hemagglutinin-
    neuraminidase family.
