-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the presentation of foreign antigens to the
    immune system.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha chain and a beta chain (beta-2-
    microglobulin).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: TL antigens are only expressed on thymocytes,
    activated T-lymphocytes and on some thymic leukemias.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MHC class I family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like C1-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
