AC   Q8Y601;
3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.11)
(Ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase).
"Comparative genomics of Listeria species.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + 3-methyl-2-
    oxobutanoate + H(2)O = tetrahydrofolate + 2-dehydropantoate.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; pantothenate biosynthesis;
    pantoate from 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate: step 1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the panB family.
