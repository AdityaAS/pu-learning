-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the presentation of foreign antigens to the
    immune system.
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer of alpha chain and a beta chain (beta-2-
    microglobulin). Interacts with human herpesvirus 8 MIR1 protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- PTM: Sulfated. Polyubiquitinated in a post ER compartment through
    interaction with human herpesvirus 8 MIR1 protein. This targets
    the protein for rapid degradation via the ubiquitin system (By
    similarity).
-!- POLYMORPHISM: The following alleles of A-1 are known: A*0101,
    A*0102, A*0103, A*0106 and A*0107. The sequence shown is that of
    A*0101.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MHC class I family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like C1-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
