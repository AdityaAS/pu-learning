Tryptophan biosynthesis protein trpCF [Includes: Indole-3-glycerol
phosphate synthase (EC 4.1.1.48) (IGPS); N-(5'-phospho-
ribosyl)anthranilate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.24) (PRAI)].

-!- FUNCTION: Bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two sequential steps
    of tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. The first reaction is
    catalyzed by the isomerase, coded by the trpF domain; the second
    reaction is catalyzed by the synthase, coded by the trpC domain.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: N-(5-phospho-beta-D-ribosyl)anthranilate = 1-
    (2-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxy-D-ribulose 5-phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 1-(2-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxy-D-ribulose 5-
    phosphate = C(1)-(3-indolyl)-glycerol 3-phosphate + CO(2) + H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-tryptophan biosynthesis; L-
    tryptophan from chorismate: step 3.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-tryptophan biosynthesis; L-
    tryptophan from chorismate: step 4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the trpC family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the trpF family.
