-!- FUNCTION: A DNA fragment of approximately 900 base pairs, adjacent
    to the fljB (H2) gene, which specifies the synthesis of phase-2
    flagellin, can exist in either orientation with respect to fljB.
    The orientation of the inversion region controls expression of
    fljB. The hin gene occupies about two-thirds of the inversion
    region; it is required for the inversion of the fljB controlling
    region.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the site-specific recombinase resolvase
    family.
