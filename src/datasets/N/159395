AC   Q7NK60;
DNA-directed RNA polymerase omega chain (EC 2.7.7.6) (RNAP omega
subunit) (Transcriptase omega chain) (RNA polymerase omega subunit).
"Complete genome structure of Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, a
cyanobacterium that lacks thylakoids.";
-!- FUNCTION: Promotes RNA polymerase assembly. Latches the N- and C-
    terminal regions of the beta' subunit thereby facilitating its
    interaction with the beta and alpha subunits (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: In cyanobacteria the RNAP catalytic core is composed of 2
    alpha, 1 beta, 1 beta', 1 gamma and 1 omega subunit. When a sigma
    factor is associated with the core the holoenzyme is formed, which
    can initiate transcription (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA polymerase omega chain family.
