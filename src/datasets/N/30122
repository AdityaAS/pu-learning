Concanavalin BR (Con BR).
"The crystal structure of Canavalia brasiliensis lectin suggests a
correlation between its quaternary conformation and its distinct
biological properties from Concanavalin A.";
-!- FUNCTION: Glucose/D-mannose specific lectin.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Binds one manganese (or other transition metal) ion
    and one calcium ion. The metal ions are essential for the
    saccharide-binding and cell-agglutinating activities.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the leguminous lectin family.
