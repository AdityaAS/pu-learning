AC   P26532;
ATP synthase subunit beta (EC 3.6.3.14) (ATPase subunit beta) (ATP
synthase F1 sector subunit beta).
"Nucleotide sequences of the atpB and the atpE genes of the brown alga
Pylaiella littoralis (L.) Kjellm.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton
    gradient across the membrane. The catalytic sites are hosted
    primarily by the beta subunits (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has four main subunits: a(1), b(1), b'(1) and c(9-12) (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
