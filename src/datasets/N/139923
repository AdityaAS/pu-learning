-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the homologous recombination repair (HRR)
    pathway of double-stranded DNA breaks arising during DNA
    replication or induced by DNA-damaging agents. The RAD51B-RAD51C
    dimer exhibits single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity. The
    BCDX2 complex binds single-stranded DNA, single-stranded gaps in
    duplex DNA and specifically to nicks in duplex DNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with RAD51B and XRCC3. Part of a BCDX2 complex
    consisting of RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D and XRCC2. Part of a complex
    consisting of RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2 and XRCC3. Part of a
    complex with RAD51B and RAD51.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in a variety of tissues, with
    highest expression in testis, heart muscle, spleen and prostate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the recA family. RAD51 subfamily.
