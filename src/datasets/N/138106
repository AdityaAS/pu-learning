AC   Q6SZS6;
Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial precursor (EC 1.3.3.1)
(Dihydroorotate oxidase) (DHOdehase) (DHODase) (DHOD).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (S)-dihydroorotate + O(2) = orotate +
    H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; UMP biosynthesis; UMP from
    HCO(3)(-): step 4.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Pyrimidine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase family.
FAD; Flavoprotein; Mitochondrion; Oxidoreductase;
