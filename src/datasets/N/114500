AC   Q91009;
High affinity nerve growth factor receptor precursor (EC 2.7.10.1)
(Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1) (Trk-A) (Fragment).
"Molecular cloning of the chicken trkA and its expression in early
peripheral ganglia.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for high-affinity binding to nerve growth
    factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 and neurotrophin-4/5 but not brain-
    derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Known substrates for the Trk
    receptors are SHC1, PI 3-kinase, and PLC-gamma-1 (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + a
    [protein]-L-tyrosine phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Exists in a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric (low
    affinity) and dimeric (high affinity) structures (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=1;
      Comment=2 isoforms are produced;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q91009-1; Sequence=Displayed;
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed in the condensing dorsal root
    ganglia at embryonal day 3, and in the primary sympathetic chain
    ganglia at embryonal day 4.
-!- PTM: Ligand-mediated auto-phosphorylation (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tyr protein kinase family. Insulin
    receptor subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 LRR (leucine-rich) repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
