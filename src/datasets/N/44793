Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 1F (DREB1F protein).
"Molecular cloning, expression, phylogenetic and functional
characterization of the Arabidopsis AP2/EREBP transcription factor
family.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"DNA-binding specificity of the ERF/AP2 domain of Arabidopsis DREBs,
transcription factors involved in dehydration- and cold-inducible gene
expression.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator that binds specifically to the
    DNA sequence 5'-[AG]CCGAC-3'. Binding to the C-repeat/DRE element
    mediates cold or dehydration-inducible transcription. CBF/DREB1
    factors play a key role in freezing tolerance and cold
    acclimation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: By high-salt stress.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 AP2/ERF DNA-binding domain.
