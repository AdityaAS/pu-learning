Cysteine desulfurase (EC 2.8.1.7) (ThiI transpersulfidase) (NifS
protein homolog).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the removal of elemental sulfur and selenium
    atoms from cysteine and selenocysteine to produce alanine.
    Functions as a sulfur delivery protein for NAD, biotin and Fe-S
    cluster synthesis. Transfers sulfur on 'Cys-456' of thiI in a
    transpersulfidation reaction. Functions also as a selenium
    delivery protein in the pathway for the biosynthesis of
    selenophosphate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-cysteine + [enzyme]-cysteine = L-alanine +
    [enzyme]-S-sulfanylcysteine.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-V pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
    aminotransferase family. NifS/iscS subfamily.
Complete proteome; Pyridoxal phosphate; Transferase.
