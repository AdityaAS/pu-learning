AC   O75002;
Nuclear import protein mog1.
"Fission yeast Mog1p homologue, which interacts with the small GTPase
Ran, is required for mitosis-to-interphase transition and poly(A)(+)
RNA metabolism.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the Ran-GTPase system for nuclear protein
    import and poly(A)+ mRNA export. Required for mitosis-to-
    interphase transition.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MOG1 family.
