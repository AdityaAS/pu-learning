DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT-3) (Growth arrest and DNA-
damage-inducible protein GADD153) (C/EBP-homologous protein) (CHOP).
"CHOP, a novel developmentally regulated nuclear protein that
dimerizes with transcription factors C/EBP and LAP and functions as a
dominant-negative inhibitor of gene transcription.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits the DNA-binding activity of C/EBP and LAP by
    forming heterodimers that cannot bind DNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bZIP family.
