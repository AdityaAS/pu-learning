AC   Q58181;
Probable cobalt-precorrin-2 C(20)-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.151) (S-
adenosyl-L-methionine--cobalt-precorrin-2 methyltransferase).
"Complete genome sequence of the methanogenic archaeon, Methanococcus
jannaschii.";
-!- FUNCTION: Methylates cobalt-precorrin-2 at the C-20 position to
    produce cobalt-precorrin-3A in the anaerobic cobalamin
    biosynthesis pathway (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cobalt-factor II =
    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + cobalt-factor III.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis;
    cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide from sirohydrochlorin (anaerobic
    route): step 2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the precorrin methyltransferase family.
Cobalamin biosynthesis; Complete proteome; Methyltransferase;
S-adenosyl-L-methionine; Transferase.
