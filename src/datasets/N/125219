AC   Q8TMI8;
Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (EC 2.7.2.3).
"The genome of Methanosarcina acetivorans reveals extensive metabolic
and physiological diversity.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 3-phospho-D-glycerate = ADP + 3-phospho-
    D-glyceroyl phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; pyruvate from D-
    glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate: step 2.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphoglycerate kinase family.
ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Glycolysis; Kinase;
Nucleotide-binding; Transferase.
