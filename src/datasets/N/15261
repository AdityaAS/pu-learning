AC   P57094;
Axin-1 (Axis inhibition protein 1).
"Cooperative roles of Bozozok/Dharma and Nodal-related proteins in the
formation of the dorsal organizer in zebrafish.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway. Down-regulates
    beta-catenin. Probably facilitate the phosphorylation of beta-
    catenin and APC by GSK3B (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Probably phosphorylated by GSK3B and dephosphorylated by PP2A
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DIX domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RGS domain.
