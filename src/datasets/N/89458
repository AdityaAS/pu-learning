AC   Q932G1;
Dimethyladenosine transferase (EC 2.1.1.-) (S-adenosylmethionine-6-N',
N'-adenosyl(rRNA) dimethyltransferase) (16S rRNA dimethylase) (High
level kasugamycin resistance protein ksgA) (Kasugamycin
dimethyltransferase).
"Whole genome sequencing of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.";
"Nucleotide substitutions in Staphylococcus aureus strains, Mu50, Mu3,
and N315.";
-!- FUNCTION: Specifically dimethylates two adjacent adenosines in the
    loop of a conserved hairpin near the 3'-end of 16S rRNA in the 30S
    particle. Its inactivation leads to kasugamycin resistance (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the rRNA adenine N-6-methyltransferase
    family. KsgA subfamily.
