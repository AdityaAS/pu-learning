AC   O88479;
Proto-oncogene protein c-fos (Cellular oncogene fos).
"Differential regulation of c-fos expression in estrogen-induced
hamster renal tumors compared with kidney not due to creation of an
estrogen-response element by point mutation in the gene's flanking
sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Nuclear phosphoprotein which forms a tight but non-
    covalently linked complex with the JUN/AP-1 transcription factor.
    Has a critical function in regulating the development of cells
    destined to form and maintain the skeleton. It is thought to have
    an important role in signal transduction, cell proliferation and
    differentiation (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer. Interacts with DSIPI; this interaction
    inhibits the binding of active AP1 to its target DNA. Interacts
    with MAFB (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- INDUCTION: C-fos expression increases upon a variety of stimuli,
    including growth factors, cytokines, neurotransmitters,
    polypeptide hormones, stress and cell injury.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bZIP family. Fos subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 bZIP domain.
