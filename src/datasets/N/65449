AC   Q64422;
Glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase (EC 3.5.99.6) (Glucosamine-6-
phosphate deaminase) (GNPDA) (GlcN6P deaminase) (Oscillin).
"Calcium oscillations in mammalian eggs triggered by a soluble sperm
protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to trigger calcium oscillations in mammalian eggs.
    These oscillations serve as the essential trigger for egg
    activation and early development of the embryo.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-glucosamine 6-phosphate + H(2)O = D-fructose
    6-phosphate + NH(3).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: At the equatorial segment of the sperm head.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glucosamine/galactosamine-6-phosphate
    isomerase family.
Carbohydrate metabolism; Hydrolase.
