AC   Q1RGY9;
NADPH-dependent 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine reductase (EC 1.7.1.-) (NADPH-
dependent nitrile oxidoreductase).
"Genome sequence of Rickettsia bellii illuminates the role of amoebae
in gene exchanges between intracellular pathogens.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of 7-cyano-7-
    deazaguanine (preQ0) to 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ1) (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine + 2 NADP(+) = 7-
    cyano-7-deazaguanine + 2 NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleoside biosynthesis; queuosine biosynthesis;
    queuosine-tRNA from GTP; step 2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GTP cyclohydrolase I family. QueF type
    2 subfamily.
