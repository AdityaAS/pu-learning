AC   Q6ADB9;
Homoserine O-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.31) (Homoserine O-trans-
acetylase) (Homoserine transacetylase) (HTA).
"The genome sequence of the Gram-positive sugarcane pathogen Leifsonia
xyli subsp. xyli.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + L-homoserine = CoA + O-acetyl-L-
    homoserine.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-methionine biosynthesis; O-
    acetyl-L-homoserine from L-homoserine: single step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the AB hydrolase superfamily. HTA family.
Acyltransferase; Amino-acid biosynthesis; Complete proteome;
