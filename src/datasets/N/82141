strain 1.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate + NADP(+)
    = (S)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-oxobutanoate + NADPH.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (2R,3R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylpentanoate +
    NADP(+) = (S)-2-hydroxy-2-ethyl-3-oxobutanoate + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-isoleucine biosynthesis; L-
