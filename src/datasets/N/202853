AC   P08232;
Long tail fiber protein p37 (Protein Gp37) (Receptor recognizing
protein) (Fragment).
"Receptor-recognizing proteins of T-even type bacteriophages. Constant
and hypervariable regions and an unusual case of evolution.";
-!- FUNCTION: Structural component of the distal-half tail fiber. It
    constitutes the part of the long tail fibers that recognizes the
    bacterial receptor.
-!- SUBUNIT: The distal half-fiber contains two molecules each of Gp36
    and Gp37 and one molecule of Gp35.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The two Gp37 protein chains run in parallel, the
    length of the distal half-fiber, with the amino end near the
    center kink of the fiber and the carboxyl end at the distal tip.
    The other polypeptides are distributed uniformly along the length
    of the distal half-fiber.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tail fiber family.
Fiber protein.
