AC   Q6GHH7;
Uridylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.-) (UK) (Uridine monophosphate kinase) (UMP
kinase).
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the phosphorylation of UMP to UDP (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + UMP = ADP + UDP.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; CTP biosynthesis; UDP from UMP
    (UMPK route): single step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UMP kinase family.
Complete proteome; Kinase; Pyrimidine biosynthesis; Transferase.
