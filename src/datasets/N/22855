-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA). Mediates cell-cell
    and cell-matrix interactions through its affinity for HA, and
    possibly also through its affinity for other ligands such as
    osteopontin, collagens, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).
    Adhesion with HA plays an important role in cell migration, tumor
    growth and progression. Also involved in lymphocyte activation,
    recirculation and homing, and in hematopoiesis. Altered expression
    or dysfunction causes numerous pathogenic phenotypes. Great
    protein heterogeneity due to numerous alternative splicing and
    post-translational modification events.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with HA, as well as other glycosaminoglycans,
    collagen, laminin, and fibronectin via its N-terminal segment.
    Interacts with ANK, the ERM proteins (VIL2, RDX and MSN), and NF2
    via its C-terminal segment.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P18011:ipaB (xeno); NbExp=4; IntAct=EBI-490245, EBI-490239;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
      Comment=Additional isoforms seem to exist. Additional isoforms
      are produced by alternative splicing of 10 out of 19 exons
      within the extracellular domain. Additional diversity is
      generated through the utilization of internal splice donor and
      acceptor sites within 2 of the exons. A variation in the
      cytoplasmic domain was shown to result from the alternative
      splicing of 2 exons. Isoform CD44 is expected to be expressed in
      normal cells. Splice variants have been found in many tumor cell
      lines. Exons 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 19 are
      alternatively spliced;
    Name=CD44;
      IsoId=P16070-1; Sequence=Displayed;
      Note=Corresponds to the largest isoform;
    Name=CD44SP;
      IsoId=P16070-2; Sequence=VSP_005303, VSP_005304;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: An epithelial isoform (CD44E) is expressed by
    cells of epithelium and highly expressed by carcinomas. An
    hematopoietic isoform (CD44H) is expressed by cells of mesodermal
    origin. Expression is repressed in neuroblastoma cells.
-!- PTM: Proteolytically cleaved in the extracellular matrix by
    specific proteinases (possibly MMPs) in several cell lines and
    tumors.
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated.
-!- PTM: O-glycosylated; contains more-or-less-sulfated chondroitin
    sulfate glycans, whose number may affect the accessibility of
    specific proteinases to their cleavage site(s).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated; activation of PKC results in the
    dephosphorylation of Ser-706 (constitutive phosphorylation site),
    and the phosphorylation of Ser-672.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: CD44 is responsible for the Indian blood group
    system. The molecular basis of the In(A)=In1/In(B)=In2 blood group
    antigens is a single variation in position 46; In(B), the most
    frequent allele, has Arg-46.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Link domain.
