AC   Q9GK79;
Urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor precursor (uPAR) (U-
PAR) (CD87 antigen).
"Differential binding of urokinase and peptide antagonists to the
urokinase receptor: evidence from characterization of the receptor in
four primate species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts as a receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator.
    Plays a role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation.
    Mediates the proteolysis-independent signal transduction
    activation effects of U-PA. It is subject to negative-feedback
    regulation by U-PA which cleaves it into an inactive form (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; GPI-anchor (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 UPAR/Ly6 domains.
Glycoprotein; GPI-anchor; Lipoprotein; Membrane; Receptor; Repeat;
Signal.
