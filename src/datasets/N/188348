AC   O24735;
Thermosome subunit beta (Thermosome subunit 2) (Chaperonin beta
subunit).
"Purification and molecular cloning of the group II chaperonin from
the acidothermophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus sp. strain 7.";
"Complete genome sequence of an aerobic thermoacidophilic
Crenarchaeon, Sulfolobus tokodaii strain7.";
-!- FUNCTION: Molecular chaperone; binds unfolded polypeptides in
    vitro, and has a weak ATPase activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a hetero-oligomeric complex of two stacked nine-
    membered rings; one of alpha and the other of beta subunits (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TCP-1 chaperonin family.
ATP-binding; Chaperone; Complete proteome; Direct protein sequencing;
