AC   P24853; Q9XSC7;
Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 precursor (IGFBP-2) (IBP-
2) (IGF-binding protein 2).
"Complex mediation of uterine endometrial epithelial cell growth by
insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) and IGF-binding protein-2.";
"Identification and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of three insulin-
like growth factor-binding proteins in porcine serum.";
-!- FUNCTION: IGF-binding proteins prolong the half-life of the IGFs
    and have been shown to either inhibit or stimulate the growth
    promoting effects of the IGFs on cell culture. They alter the
    interaction of IGFs with their cell surface receptors.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds IGF2 more than IGF1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 IGFBP domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 thyroglobulin type-1 domain.
