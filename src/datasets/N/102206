AC   Q9RKA8;
Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein C.
"Complete genome sequence of the model actinomycete Streptomyces
coelicolor A3(2).";
-!- FUNCTION: Together with moaA, is involved in the conversion of a
    guanosine derivative (5'-GTP) into molybdopterin precursor Z (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; molybdopterin biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the moaC family.
Complete proteome; Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis.
