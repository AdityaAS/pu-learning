AC   Q9ZJX4;
Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.2) (Tryptophan--tRNA ligase)
(TrpRS).
"Genomic sequence comparison of two unrelated isolates of the human
gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-tryptophan + tRNA(Trp) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-tryptophyl-tRNA(Trp).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Ligase;
Nucleotide-binding; Protein biosynthesis.
