-!- FUNCTION: Cadherins are calcium dependent cell adhesion proteins.
    They preferentially interact with themselves in a homophilic
    manner in connecting cells; cadherins may thus contribute to the
    sorting of heterogeneous cell types.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=O75309-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O75309-2; Sequence=VSP_013354;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Kidney specific.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 cadherin domains.
