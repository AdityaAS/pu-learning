AC   Q01513;
Adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) (ATP pyrophosphate-lyase) (Adenylyl
cyclase).
"An additional copy of the adenylate cyclase-encoding gene relieves
developmental defects produced by a mutation in a vegetative
incompatibility-controlling gene in Podospora anserina.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays essential roles in regulation of cellular
    metabolism by catalyzing the synthesis of a second messenger,
    cAMP.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP = 3',5'-cyclic AMP + diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adenylyl cyclase class-3 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 guanylate cyclase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 21 LRR (leucine-rich) repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PP2C-like domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ras-associating domain.
