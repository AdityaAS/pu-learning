AC   Q9QAR8;
Nucleocapsid protein (N structural protein) (NC).
"Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of all genes encoded by
the 3' genomic portion (9.5 kb) of respiratory bovine coronaviruses
and comparisons among respiratory and enteric coronaviruses.";
-!- FUNCTION: Major structural component of virions that associates
    with genomic RNA to form a long, flexible, helical nucleocapsid.
    Interaction with the M protein leads to the formation of virus
    particles. Binds to cellular membranes and phospholipids. Elicits
    cell-mediated immunity. May play roles in viral transcription and
    translation, and/or replication.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer and oligomer. Both monomeric and oligomeric forms
    interact with RNA. Interacts with the M protein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Virion. Cell membrane. Note=Located inside
    the virion, complexed with the viral RNA. May be associated with
    cellular membranes where it participates in viral RNA synthesis
    and virus budding.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on serine residues (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the coronaviruses nucleocapsid protein
    family.
