-!- FUNCTION: Plays an essential role in the utilization of numerous
    aromatic and hydroaromatic compounds via the beta-ketoadipate
    pathway.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate + O(2) = 3-carboxy-
    cis,cis-muconate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds Fe(3+) ion per subunit.
-!- PATHWAY: Aromatic compound metabolism; beta-ketoadipate pathway;
    3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate from 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate: single
    step.
-!- SUBUNIT: The enzyme is an oligomer of 12 copies of the alpha and
    beta chains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the intradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenase
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Strain ATCC 23975 was originally classified as being from
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
