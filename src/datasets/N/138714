AC   P44341;
CTP synthase (EC 6.3.4.2) (UTP--ammonia ligase) (CTP synthetase).
"Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae
Rd.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the ATP-dependent amination of UTP to CTP with
    either L-glutamine or ammonia as the source of nitrogen (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + UTP + NH(3) = ADP + phosphate + CTP.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Allosterically activated by GTP, when glutamine
    is the substrate. Inhibited by CTP (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; CTP biosynthesis; CTP from UDP:
    step 2 [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CTP synthase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 glutamine amidotransferase type-1 domain.
Complete proteome; Glutamine amidotransferase; Ligase;
