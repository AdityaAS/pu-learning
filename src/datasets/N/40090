AC   Q62095; Q9QWS9;
ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3Y (EC 3.6.1.-) (DEAD box protein 3, Y-
chromosomal) (DEAD-box RNA helicase DEAD2) (mDEAD2) (D1Pas1-related
sequence 1).
"The mouse Y chromosome interval necessary for spermatogonial
proliferation is gene dense with syntenic homology to the human AZFa
region.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Mouse erythroid cells express multiple putative RNA helicase genes
exhibiting high sequence conservation from yeast to mammals.";
"Human DDX3Y, the Y-encoded isoform of RNA helicase DDX3, rescues a
hamster temperature-sensitive ET24 mutant cell line with a DDX3X
mutation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase. May play a role in
    spermatogenesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Note=Shuttles between
    the nucleus and the cytoplasm in an XPO1-dependent manner.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found in heart, brain, liver, skeletal muscle,
    kidney and testis. Low expression detected in lung. In testis,
    expressed in all types of spermatogenic cells including
    spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and somatic Sertoli cells
    within the seminiferous tubules. Also expressed in Leydig cells
    and other interstitial cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DEAD box helicase family. DDX3/DED1
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase C-terminal domain.
