AC   Q02287;
T-protein [Includes: Chorismate mutase (EC 5.4.99.5) (CM); Prephenate
dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.12) (PDH)].
"A monofunctional prephenate dehydrogenase created by cleavage of the
5' 109 bp of the tyrA gene from Erwinia herbicola.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Chorismate = prephenate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Prephenate + NAD(+) = 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
    + CO(2) + NADH.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-tyrosine biosynthesis; L-
    tyrosine from prephenate: step 1.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; prephenate
    biosynthesis; prephenate from chorismate: single step [final
    step].
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 chorismate mutase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 prephenate/arogenate dehydrogenase domain.
