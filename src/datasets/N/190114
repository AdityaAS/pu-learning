-!- FUNCTION: Troponin T is the tropomyosin-binding subunit of
    troponin, the thin filament regulatory complex which confers
    calcium-sensitivity to striated muscle actomyosin ATPase activity.

-!- DISEASE: Defects in TNNT1 are the cause of nemaline myopathy type
    5 (NEM5) [MIM:605355]; also known as Amish nemaline myopathy (ANM)
    [MIM:605355]. This form of nemaline myopathy (NEM) is common among
    Old Order Amish with an incidence of approximately 1:500. Affected
    infants display tremors with hypotonia and mild contractures of
    the shoulders and hips. Proximal contractures progressively weaken
    and a pectus carinatum deformity develops before children die of
    respiratory insufficiency, usually in the second year. A
    nucleotide replacement in exon 11 causes the protein to be
    truncated after residue 178.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the troponin T family.
