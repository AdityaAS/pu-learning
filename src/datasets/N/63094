hormones common subunit alpha) (Follitropin alpha chain) (Follicle-
stimulating hormone alpha chain) (FSH-alpha) (Lutropin alpha chain)
(Luteinizing hormone alpha chain) (LSH-alpha) (Thyrotropin alpha
chain) (Thyroid-stimulating hormone alpha chain) (TSH-alpha).
"Amphibian lutropin and follitropin from the bullfrog Rana
catesbeiana. Complete amino acid sequence of the alpha subunit.";
"The antigenic structure of the human glycoprotein hormone alpha-
subunit: II. Cross-species comparisons.";
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a common alpha chain and a unique beta
    chain which confers biological specificity to thyrotropin,
    lutropin, follitropin and gonadotropin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycoprotein hormones subunit alpha
    family.
