-!- FUNCTION: Molecular chaperone; assist the folding of proteins upon
    ATP hydrolysis. Known to play a role, in vitro, in the folding of
    actin and tubulin.
-!- SUBUNIT: Hetero-oligomeric complex of about 850 to 900 kDa that
    forms two stacked rings, 12 to 16 nm in diameter. Interacts with
    PACRG.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TCP-1 chaperonin family.
