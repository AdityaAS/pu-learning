AC   O73947;
DNA polymerase sliding clamp (Proliferating cell nuclear antigen
homolog) (PCNA).
"Functional interactions of a homolog of proliferating cell nuclear
antigen with DNA polymerases in Archaea.";
"The complete sequence of the Pyrococcus furiosus genome.";
"Crystal structure of an archaeal DNA sliding clamp: proliferating
cell nuclear antigen from Pyrococcus furiosus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sliding clamp subunit. Responsible for tethering the
    catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase to DNA during high-speed
    replication.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer. Interacts with both Pol I and Pol II.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PCNA family.
3D-structure; Complete proteome; DNA replication; DNA-binding.
