AC   Q84XB3;
Ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1 (Ethylene-responsive
element-binding factor 1) (EREBP-1) (ERF1-like protein) (LeERF1).
"New members of the tomato ERF family show specific expression pattern
and diverse DNA-binding capacity to the GCC box element.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the regulation of gene expression during
    fruit ripening, by stress factors and by components of stress
    signal transduction pathways. Transcription factor that binds to
    the GCC-box pathogenesis-related promoter element. Probably acts
    as a transcriptional activator and may be involved in disease
    resistance pathways (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Present in stems.
-!- INDUCTION: Strong induction by ethylene and by wounding.
-!- DOMAIN: The AP2/ERF domain binds specifically to the 5'-GCCGCC-3'
    motif. The affinity of this binding is higher if the seventh
    amino-acid of this domain is basic (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ethylene-response factor family. Class
    1 subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 AP2/ERF DNA-binding domain.
