AC   P04329;
Protein alpha [Contains: Coat protein beta (EC 3.4.23.44) (Nodavirus
endopeptidase); Coat protein gamma].
"Primary and secondary structure of black beetle virus RNA2, the
genomic messenger for BBV coat protein precursor.";
"Structural homology among four nodaviruses as deduced by sequencing
and X-ray crystallography.";
"The refined three-dimensional structure of an insect virus at 2.8-A
resolution.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the provirion whose T=3 icosahedral shell is
    composed of 180 copies of the alpha protein which encapsidate the
    two genomic RNAs. Protein alpha autocatalytically maturates into
    coat proteins beta and gamma.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of an asparaginyl bond involved in
    the maturation of the structural protein of the virus, typically
    -Asn-|-Ala- or -Asn-|-Phe-.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase A6 family.
3D-structure; Aspartyl protease; Capsid protein; Hydrolase; Protease;
