AC   Q5KN22; Q55YQ1;
Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 2 (EC 6.3.2.19) (Ubiquitin-protein
ligase UBC2) (Ubiquitin carrier protein UBC2).
"The genome of the basidiomycetous yeast and human pathogen
Cryptococcus neoformans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other
    proteins. Plays a role in transcription regulation by catalyzing
    the monoubiquitination of 'Lys-123' of histone H2B leading to the
    methylation of histone H3 and the silencing of telomeric-
    associated genes. Also involved in postreplication repair of UV-
    damaged DNA, in N-end rule-dependent protein degradation and in
    sporulation (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + ubiquitin + protein lysine = AMP +
    diphosphate + protein N-ubiquityllysine.
-!- PATHWAY: Ubiquitin conjugation; second step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family.
