Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10B precursor (Death
receptor 5) (MK).
"Molecular cloning and functional analysis of the mouse homologue of
the KILLER/DR5 tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) death receptor.";
"Mouse TRAIL receptor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for the cytotoxic ligand TNFSF10/TRAIL. The
    adapter molecule FADD recruits caspase-8 to the activated
    receptor. The resulting death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)
    performs caspase-8 proteolytic activation which initiates the
    subsequent cascade of caspases (aspartate-specific cysteine
    proteases) mediating apoptosis. Promotes the activation of NF-
    kappa-B.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer. Can interact with TRADD and RIP (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in heart, lung and kidney.
-!- INDUCTION: TNFRSF10B is regulated by the tumor suppressor p53.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 death domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 TNFR-Cys repeats.
