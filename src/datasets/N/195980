Trypanothione reductase (EC 1.8.1.12) (TR) (N(1),N(8)-
bis(glutathionyl)spermidine reductase).
"Cloning, sequencing, overproduction and purification of trypanothione
reductase from Trypanosoma cruzi.";
"Site-directed mutagenesis of the redox-active cysteines of
Trypanosoma cruzi trypanothione reductase.";
"The structure of Trypanosoma cruzi trypanothione reductase in the

-!- FUNCTION: Trypanothione is the parasite analog of glutathione;
    this enzyme is the equivalent of glutathione reductase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Trypanothione + NADP(+) = trypanothione
    disulfide + NADPH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD per subunit.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The active site is a redox-active disulfide bond.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I pyridine nucleotide-disulfide
    oxidoreductase family.
