-!- FUNCTION: Protein kinase that phosphorylates 'Ser-15' of p53/TP53
    protein and may therefore participate in its activation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in testis. Weakly expressed
    in heart kidney and spleen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tyr protein kinase family. BUD32
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
