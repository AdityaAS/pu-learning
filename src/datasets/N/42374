AC   O33844;
DNA adenine methylase (EC 2.1.1.72) (Deoxyadenosyl-methyltransferase)
(DNA adenine methyltransferase) (M.TpaI).
"Identification and characterization of a Treponema pallidum subsp.
pallidum gene encoding a DNA adenine methyltransferase.";
"Complete genome sequence of Treponema pallidum, the syphilis
spirochete.";
-!- FUNCTION: Methylates DNA within the sequence GATC. Directly
    involved in methyl-directed DNA mismatch repair, DNA replication,
    and gene expression.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + DNA adenine = S-
    adenosyl-L-homocysteine + DNA 6-methylaminopurine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the N4/N6-methyltransferase family.
Complete proteome; DNA replication; Methyltransferase; Transferase.
