AC   O64235;
DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7).
"Genome structure of mycobacteriophage D29: implications for phage
evolution.";
-!- FUNCTION: In addition to polymerase activity, this DNA polymerase
    seems to exhibit a 3' to 5' exonuclease activity.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA polymerase type-A family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 3'-5' exonuclease domain.
