AC   Q64143;
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit gamma (PI3-kinase
p85-subunit gamma) (PtdIns-3-kinase p85-gamma) (p55PIK).
"The structure and function of p55PIK reveal a new regulatory subunit
for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to activated (phosphorylated) protein-tyrosine
    kinases through its SH2 domain and regulates their kinase
    activity. During insulin stimulation, it also binds to IRS-1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a p110 (catalytic) and a p55 (regulatory)
    subunits.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highest levels in brain and testis. Lower
    levels in adipose tissue, kidney, heart, lung and skeletal muscle.
    Barely detectable in liver and spleen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PI3K p85 subunit family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 SH2 domains.
