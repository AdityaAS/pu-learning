AC   Q7W5D0;
2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (EC 4.6.1.12)
(MECPS) (MECDP-synthase).
"Comparative analysis of the genome sequences of Bordetella pertussis,
Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica.";
-!- FUNCTION: Converts 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2-
    phosphate into 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate
    (MECDP) and CMP (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-
    methyl-D-erythritol = 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate
    + CMP.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 divalent metal cation per subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; isopentenyl-PP biosynthesis via
    DXP pathway; isopentenyl-PP from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:
    step 4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ispF family.
Complete proteome; Isoprene biosynthesis; Lyase; Metal-binding.
