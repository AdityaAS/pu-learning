AC   Q59I72;
Catenin alpha-1.
"Regulation of beta-catenin signaling and maintenance of chondrocyte
differentiation by ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of
alpha-catenin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Associates with the cytoplasmic domain of a variety of
    cadherins. The association of catenins to cadherins produces a
    complex which is linked to the actin filament network, and which
    seems to be of primary importance for cadherins cell-adhesion
    properties. Can associate with both E- and N-cadherins. May play a
    crucial role in cell differentiation (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds MLLT4 and F-actin. Interacts directly with CTNNB1
    and PSEN1 to form part of the PSEN1/cadherin/catenin adhesion
    complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell junction (By similarity). Note=Found at
    cell-cell boundaries and probably at cell-matrix boundaries (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: Sumoylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the vinculin/alpha-catenin family.
