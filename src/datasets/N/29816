AC   Q9HNU8;
FO synthase subunit 2 (EC 2.5.1.-) (7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-
deazariboflavin synthase subunit 2).
"Genome sequence of Halobacterium species NRC-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the radical-mediated transfer of the
    hydroxybenzyl group from 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) to 5-amino-
    6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione to form 7,8-didemethyl-
    8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (FO) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate + 5-amino-6-
    ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione = 7,8-didemethyl-8-
    hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin + oxalate + NH(3).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster. The cluster is coordinated with
    3 cysteines and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; FO biosynthesis.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: F420 biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Consists of two subunits, cofG and cofH (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the radical SAM superfamily. CofH family.
