AC   Q9HNZ0;
L-aspartate oxidase (EC 1.4.3.16) (LASPO) (Quinolinate synthetase B).
"Genome sequence of Halobacterium species NRC-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the oxidation of L-aspartate to
    iminoaspartate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-aspartate + H(2)O + O(2) = oxaloacetate +
    NH(3) + H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: FAD.
-!- PATHWAY: NAD biosynthesis; aspartate to NaMN; first step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FAD-dependent oxidoreductase 2 family.
    NadB subfamily.
