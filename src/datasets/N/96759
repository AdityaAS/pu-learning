AC   P01549;
Macromomycin precursor (MCR) (Auromomycin apoprotein).
"Nucleotide sequence of the macromomycin apoprotein gene and its
expression in Streptomyces macromomyceticus.";
"Primary structure of macromomycin, an antitumor antibiotic protein.";
"Amino terminal amino acid sequence of macromomycin, a protein
antitumor antibiotic.";
"Crystal structure analysis of auromomycin apoprotein (macromomycin)
shows importance of protein side chains to chromophore binding
selectivity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds non-covalently to a chromophore which is the
    cytotoxic and mutagenic component of the antibiotic. The
    chromophore binds to DNA as a weak intercalator and causes single-
    and double-strand breaks.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the neocarzinostatin family.
