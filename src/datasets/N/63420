AC   Q8TZ14;
Glucosamine--fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase [isomerizing]
(EC 2.6.1.16) (Hexosephosphate aminotransferase) (D-fructose-6-
phosphate amidotransferase) (GFAT) (L-glutamine-D-fructose-6-phosphate
amidotransferase) (Glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase).
"The complete genome of hyperthermophile Methanopyrus kandleri AV19
and monophyly of archaeal methanogens.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the first step in hexosamine metabolism,
    converting fructose-6P into glucosamine-6P using glutamine as a
    nitrogen source (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-glutamine + D-fructose 6-phosphate = L-
    glutamate + D-glucosamine 6-phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the SIS family.
    GFAT subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 glutamine amidotransferase type-2 domain.
