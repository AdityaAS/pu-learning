-!- FUNCTION: Participates actively in the response to hyperosmotic
    and heat shock by preventing the aggregation of stress-denatured
    proteins, in association with dnaK and grpE. It is the nucleotide
    exchange factor for dnaK and may function as a thermosensor.
    Unfolded proteins bind initially to dnaJ; upon interaction with
    the dnaJ-bound protein, dnaK hydrolyzes its bound ATP, resulting
    in the formation of a stable complex. GrpE releases ADP from dnaK;
    ATP binding to dnaK triggers the release of the substrate protein,
    thus completing the reaction cycle. Several rounds of ATP-
    dependent interactions between dnaJ, dnaK and grpE are required
    for fully efficient folding (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the grpE family.
