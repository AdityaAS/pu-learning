AC   P51472;
Blue-sensitive opsin (Blue cone photoreceptor pigment).
"Molecular characterization of a blue visual pigment gene in the fish
Astyanax fasciatus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Visual pigments are the light-absorbing molecules that
    mediate vision. They consist of an apoprotein, opsin, covalently
    linked to cis-retinal.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: The color pigments are found in the cone
    photoreceptor cells.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on some or all of the serine and threonine
    residues present in the C-terminal region (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
    Opsin subfamily.
