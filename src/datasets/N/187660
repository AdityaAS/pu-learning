subtilis at 1.25 A resolution.";
-!- FUNCTION: Condenses 4-methyl-5-(beta-hydroxyethyl)thiazole
    monophosphate (THZ-P) and 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl pyrimidine
    pyrophosphate (HMP-PP) to form thiamine monophosphate (TMP).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine
    diphosphate + 4-methyl-5-(2-phosphono-oxyethyl)thiazole =
    diphosphate + thiamine monophosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; thiamine pyrophosphate
    biosynthesis; thiamine pyrophosphate from 4-amino-2-methyl-5-
    diphosphomethylpyrimidine and 4-methyl-5-(2-phosphoethyl)-
    thiazole: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TMP-PPase family.
