AC   P52210;
Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B (EC 4.1.2.13) (Liver-type aldolase).
"Cloning and characterization of a full-length cDNA coding for ovine
aldolase B from fetal mesonephros.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate = glycerone
    phosphate + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; D-glyceraldehyde 3-
    phosphate and glycerone phosphate from D-glucose: step 4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: In vertebrates, three forms of this ubiquitous
    glycolytic enzyme are found, aldolase A in muscle, aldolase B in
    liver and aldolase C in brain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class I fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
    family.
Acetylation; Glycolysis; Lyase; Schiff base.
