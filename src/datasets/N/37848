AC   Q8X7X7;
Sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit 1 (EC 2.7.7.4) (Sulfate adenylate
transferase) (SAT) (ATP-sulfurylase large subunit).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be the GTPase, regulating ATP sulfurylase activity
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + sulfate = diphosphate + adenylyl
    sulfate.
-!- PATHWAY: Sulfur metabolism; hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis; sulfite
    from sulfate: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer composed of cysD, the smaller subunit, and
    cysN (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GTP-binding elongation factor family.
    CysN/nodQ subfamily.
