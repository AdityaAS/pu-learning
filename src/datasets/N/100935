AC   Q73W20;
tRNA delta(2)-isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase (EC 2.5.1.8) (IPP
transferase) (Isopentenyl-diphosphate:tRNA isopentenyltransferase)
(IPTase) (IPPT).
"The complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium avium subspecies
paratuberculosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of 2-
    methylthio-N6-(delta(2)-isopentenyl)-adenosine (MS[2]I[6]A)
    adjacent to the anticodon of several tRNA species (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Isopentenyl diphosphate + tRNA = diphosphate +
    tRNA containing 6-isopentenyladenosine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IPP transferase family.
