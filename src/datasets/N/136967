AC   P30520; Q96EG7;
Adenylosuccinate synthetase isozyme 2 (EC 6.3.4.4) (Adenylosuccinate
synthetase, acidic isozyme) (IMP--aspartate ligase 2) (AdSS 2)
(AMPSase 2).
"Cloning and characterization of the cDNA encoding human
adenylosuccinate synthetase.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays an important role in the de novo pathway of purine
    nucleotide biosynthesis.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: GTP + IMP + L-aspartate = GDP + phosphate + 6-
    N-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)-AMP.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; AMP biosynthesis; AMP from IMP:
    step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Note=Partially associated with
    particulate fractions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adenylosuccinate synthetase family.
