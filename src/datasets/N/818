AC   P41575;
6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating (EC 1.1.1.44)
(Fragment).
"Intergeneric transfer and recombination of the 6-phosphogluconate
dehydrogenase gene (gnd) in enteric bacteria.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 6-phospho-D-gluconate + NADP(+) = D-ribulose
    5-phosphate + CO(2) + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; pentose phosphate pathway; D-
    ribulose 5-phosphate from D-glucose 6-phosphate (oxidative stage):
    step 3.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase
    family.
Gluconate utilization; NADP; Oxidoreductase; Pentose shunt.
