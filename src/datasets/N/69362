AC   P48197;
DNA gyrase subunit B (EC 5.99.1.3).
"Complete genome sequence of Caulobacter crescentus.";
"Asymmetric expression of the gyrase B gene from the replication-
competent chromosome in the Caulobacter crescentus predivisional
cell.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA gyrase negatively supercoils closed circular double-
    stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent manner and also catalyzes the
    interconversion of other topological isomers of double-stranded
    DNA rings, including catenanes and knotted rings.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP-dependent breakage, passage and rejoining
    of double-stranded DNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Made up of two chains. The A chain is responsible for DNA
    breakage and rejoining; the B chain catalyzes ATP hydrolysis. The
    enzyme forms an A2B2 tetramer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type II topoisomerase family.
ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Isomerase; Nucleotide-binding;
Topoisomerase.
