AC   Q9PBJ4;
Bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase, symmetrical (EC 3.6.1.41)
(Diadenosine tetraphosphatase) (Ap4A hydrolase) (Diadenosine 5',5'''-
P1,P4-tetraphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase).
"The genome sequence of the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Hydrolyzes diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate to
    yield ADP (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: P(1),P(4)-bis(5'-adenosyl) tetraphosphate +
    H(2)O = 2 ADP.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ap4A hydrolase family.
