AC   Q3IMS5;
Probable translation initiation factor IF-2.
"Living with two extremes: conclusions from the genome sequence of
Natronomonas pharaonis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Function in general translation initiation by promoting
    the binding of the formylmethionine-tRNA to ribosomes. Seems to
    function along with eIF-2 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IF-2 family.
 GO:0003924; F:GTPase activity; IEA:HAMAP.
