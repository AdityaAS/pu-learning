AC   P91454;
Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM14 (DnaJ
homolog subfamily C member 21).
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable component of the PAM complex, a complex
    required for the translocation of transit peptide-containing
    proteins from the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix in
    an ATP-dependent manner. May act as a co-chaperone that stimulate
    the ATP-dependent activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Probable component of the PAM complex at least composed
    of a mitochondrial HSP70 protein, GrpE, tim-44, tim-16 and tim-
    14/dnj-21 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    single-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TIM14 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 J domain.
