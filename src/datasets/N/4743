AC   Q9YE60;
N-glycosylase/DNA lyase (AGOG) (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase)
(EC 3.2.2.-) (DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase)
(EC 4.2.99.18) (AP lyase).
"Complete genome sequence of an aerobic hyper-thermophilic
crenarchaeon, Aeropyrum pernix K1.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA repair enzyme that is part of the base excision
    repair (BER) pathway; protects from oxidative damage by removing
    the major product of DNA oxidation, 8-oxoguanine (GO), from
    single- and double-stranded DNA substrates (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cleaves the N-glycosidic bond between the
    aberrant base and the sugar-phosphate backbone to generate an
    apurinic (AP) site. Cleaves the phosphodiester bond 3' from the AP
    site by an elimination reaction, leaving a 3'-terminal unsaturated
    sugar and a product with a terminal 5'-phosphate.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains two alpha-helical subdomains, with the 8-
    oxoguanine binding site located in a cleft at their interface.
    Contains a helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) structural motif and a
    Gly/Pro-rich sequence followed by a conserved Asp (HhH-GPD motif).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the archaeal N-glycosylase/DNA lyase (AGOG)
    family.
