AC   P58706;
Antho-RIamide-1 (Antho-RIamide I) [Contains: Antho-RIamide-2 (Antho-
RIamide II)].
"Isolation of two novel neuropeptides from sea anemones: the unusual,
biologically active L-3-phenyllactyl-Tyr-Arg-Ile-NH2 and its des-
phenyllactyl fragment Tyr-Arg-Ile-NH2.";
"The expansion behaviour of sea anemones may be coordinated by two
inhibitory neuropeptides, Antho-KAamide and Antho-RIamide.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits spontaneous contractions in several muscle
    groups. May be involved in the expansion phase of feeding behavior
    in sea anemones.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Neuron specific.
Amidation; Direct protein sequencing; Neuropeptide.
