-!- FUNCTION: Component of the mediator complex, a coactivator
    involved in regulated gene transcription of nearly all RNA
    polymerase II-dependent genes. The mediator functions as a bridge
    to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to
    the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. The mediator
    complex, having a compact conformation in its free form, is
    recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory
    proteins and serves for the assembly of a functional preinitiation
    complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription
    factors. The mediator complex unfolds to an extended conformation
    and partially surrounds RNA polymerase II, specifically
    interacting with the unphosphorylated form of the C-terminal
    domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. The mediator complex
    dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the
    promoter when transcriptional elongation begins.
-!- SUBUNIT: The RNA polymerase II mediator complex is composed of at
    least 21 subunits that form three structurally distinct
    submodules. The mediator head module contains MED6, MED8, MED11,
    SRB4/MED17, SRB5/MED18, ROX3/MED19, SRB2/MED20 and SRB6/MED22, the
    middle module contains MED1, MED4, NUT1/MED5, MED7, CSE2/MED9,
    NUT2/MED10, SRB7/MED21 and SOH1/MED31, and the tail module
    contains MED2, PGD1/MED3, RGR1/MED14, GAL11/MED15 and SIN4/MED16.
    The head and the middle modules interact directly with RNA
    polymerase II, whereas the elongated tail module interacts with
    gene-specific regulatory proteins. SRB5/MED18 interacts directly
    with MED8 and SRB2/MED20.
