a proteomics survey.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the desaturation of very long chain acyl-CoAs
    to 2-trans-enoyl-CoAs (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acyl-CoA + O(2) = trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA +
    H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation system; first step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Peroxisome (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acyl-CoA oxidase family.
