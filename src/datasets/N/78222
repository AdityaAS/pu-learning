"The genome of the natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens
C58.";
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen and biotechnology agent
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-histidine = urocanate + NH(3).
-!- PATHWAY: Histidine degradation; first step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- PTM: Contains an active site 4-methylidene-imidazol-5-one (MIO),
    which is formed autocatalytically by cyclization and dehydration
    of residues Ala-Ser-Gly (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PAL/histidase family.
Complete proteome; Histidine metabolism; Lyase.
