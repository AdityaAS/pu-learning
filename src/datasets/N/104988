Metallothionein A (MT A).
"The use of metallothionein genes for determining the phylogenetic and
evolutionary relationship between extant teleosts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Metallothioneins have a high content of cysteine
    residues that bind various heavy metals (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Class I metallothioneins contain 2 metal-binding domains:
    four divalent ions are chelated within cluster A of the alpha
    domain and are coordinated via cysteinyl thiolate bridges to 11
    cysteine ligands. Cluster B, the corresponding region within the
    beta domain, can ligate three divalent ions to 9 cysteines.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the metallothionein superfamily. Type 1
    family.
Metal-binding; Metal-thiolate cluster.
