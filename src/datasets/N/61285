AC   Q7U3Q5;
Glycine dehydrogenase [decarboxylating] (EC 1.4.4.2) (Glycine
decarboxylase) (Glycine cleavage system P-protein).
"The genome of a motile marine Synechococcus.";
-!- FUNCTION: The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the degradation of
    glycine. The P protein binds the alpha-amino group of glycine
    through its pyridoxal phosphate cofactor; CO(2) is released and
    the remaining methylamine moiety is then transferred to the
    lipoamide cofactor of the H protein (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Glycine + H-protein-lipoyllysine = H-protein-
    S-aminomethyldihydrolipoyllysine + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The glycine cleavage system is composed of four proteins:
    P, T, L and H (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gcvP family.
