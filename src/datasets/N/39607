AC   Q43714;
(+)-delta-cadinene synthase isozyme A (EC 4.2.3.13) (D-cadinene
synthase).
"Cloning and heterologous expression of a second (+)-delta-cadinene
synthase from Gossypium arboreum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the cyclization of trans,trans-farnesyl
    diphosphate (FPP) to (+)-delta cadinene.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl diphosphate = (+)-
    delta-cadinene + diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (Potential).
-!- PATHWAY: Secondary metabolite biosynthesis; terpenoid
    biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the terpene synthase family.
