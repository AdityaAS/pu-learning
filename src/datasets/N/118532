AC   P29404;
Opsin Rh4 (Inner R7 photoreceptor cells opsin).
"Variable rates of evolution among Drosophila opsin genes.";
"Comparative genome sequencing of Drosophila pseudoobscura:
chromosomal, gene, and cis-element evolution.";
-!- FUNCTION: Visual pigments are the light-absorbing molecules that
    mediate vision. They consist of an apoprotein, opsin, covalently
    linked to cis-retinal.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on some or all of the serine and threonine
    residues present in the C-terminal region.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Each Drosophila eye is composed of 800 facets or
    ommatidia. Each ommatidium contains 8 photoreceptor cells (R1-R8),
    the R1 to R6 cells are outer cells, while R7 and R8 are inner
    cells.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Opsin Rh4 is sensitive to UV light.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
    Opsin subfamily.
