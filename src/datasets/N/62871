AC   Q6L2Z9;
1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18) (Glycogen branching
enzyme) (BE) (1,4-alpha-D-glucan:1,4-alpha-D-glucan 6-glucosyl-
transferase).
"Genome sequence of Picrophilus torridus and its implications for life
around pH 0.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of the alpha-1,6-glucosidic
    linkages in glycogen by scission of a 1,4-alpha-linked
    oligosaccharide from growing alpha-1,4-glucan chains and the
    subsequent attachment of the oligosaccharide to the alpha-1,6
    position (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Transfers a segment of a 1,4-alpha-D-glucan
    chain to a primary hydroxy group in a similar glucan chain.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycogen biosynthesis; third step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 13 family.
