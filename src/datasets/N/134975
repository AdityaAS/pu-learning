AC   P79801;
Presenilin-2 (EC 3.4.23.-) (PS-2) [Contains: Presenilin-2 NTF subunit;
Presenilin-2 CTF subunit] (Fragment).
"Cloning of the presenilin 2 cDNA and its distribution in brain of the
primate, Microcebus murinus: coexpression with betaAPP and Tau
proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase
    complex, an endoprotease complex that catalyzes the intramembrane
    cleavage of integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and
    APP (beta-amyloid precursor protein). Requires the other members
    of the gamma-secretase complex to have a protease activity. May
    play a role in intracellular signaling and gene expression or in
    linking chromatin to the nuclear membrane. May function in the
    cytoplasmic partitioning of proteins (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Component of the gamma-secretase complex, a
    complex composed of a presenilin homodimer (PSEN1 or PSEN2),
    nicastrin (NCSTN), APH1 (APH1A or APH1B) and PEN2. Such minimal
    complex is sufficient for secretase activity, although other
    components may exist. Interacts with DOCK3. Interacts with
    HERPUD1, FLNA and FLNB (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity). Golgi
    apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The PAL motif is required for normal active site
    conformation (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on serine residues (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase A22A family.
