AC   Q8G3E9;
Uracil-DNA glycosylase (EC 3.2.2.-) (UDG).
"The genome sequence of Bifidobacterium longum reflects its adaptation
to the human gastrointestinal tract.";
-!- FUNCTION: Excises uracil residues from the DNA which can arise as
    a result of misincorporation of dUMP residues by DNA polymerase or
    due to deamination of cytosine (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the uracil-DNA glycosylase family.
