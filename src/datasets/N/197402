Anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.115) (Flavonol 3-O-
glucosyltransferase) (UDP-glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase).
"Molecular and biochemical characterization of three anthocyanin
synthetic enzymes from Gentiana triflora.";
-!- FUNCTION: In the presence of other necessary color factors, this
    glycosylation reaction allows the accumulation of anthocyanin
    pigments (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-D-glucose + an anthocyanidin = UDP + an
    anthocyanidin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside.
-!- PATHWAY: Anthocyanin biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UDP-glycosyltransferase family.
 GO:0047213; F:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase activity; IEA:EC.
