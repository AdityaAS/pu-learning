AC   P34710;
Netrin unc-6 precursor (Uncoordinated protein 6).
"UNC-6, a laminin-related protein, guides cell and pioneer axon
migrations in C. elegans.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
"Expression of the UNC-5 guidance receptor in the touch neurons of C.
elegans steers their axons dorsally.";
"UNC-40, a C. elegans homolog of DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer),
is required in motile cells responding to UNC-6 netrin cues.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of an extracellular matrix cue that guides
    dorsoventral migrations on the epidermis. Required for the
    guidance of pioneer axons and migrating cells along the body wall.
    Its association with either unc-40 or unc-5 receptors will lead to
    axon attraction or repulsion, respectively.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds to unc-5 and unc-40 receptors.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein; extracellular space;
    extracellular matrix; basement membrane. Note=Epidermal basal
    lamina.
-!- DOMAIN: Mutations that delete the second laminin EGF-like repeat
    impair only dorsal migrations of mesodermal cells and axons.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 laminin EGF-like domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 laminin N-terminal domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 NTR domain.
