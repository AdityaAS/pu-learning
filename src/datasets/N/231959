AC   Q969S3;
Zinc finger protein 622 (Zinc finger-like protein 9).
"Phosphorylation of a novel zinc-finger-like protein, ZPR9, by murine
protein serine/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38).";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Enhancement of B-MYB transcriptional activity by ZPR9, a novel zinc
finger protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: May behave as an activator of the bound transcription
    factor, MYBL2, and be involved in embryonic development.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homo- and heterodimer. Interacts with MELK and MYBL2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in lung, kidney, spleen, liver and
    brain with lowest expression in kidney.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by MELK. The phosphorylation may redirect the
    protein to the nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 U1-type zinc fingers.
