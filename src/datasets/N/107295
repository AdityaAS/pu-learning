AC   Q46L21;
N-acetylmuramic acid 6-phosphate etherase (EC 4.2.-.-) (MurNAc-6-P
etherase).
"Complete sequence of Prochlorococcus marinus str. NATL2A.";
-!- FUNCTION: Specifically catalyzes the cleavage of the D-lactyl
    ether substituent of MurNAc 6-phosphate, producing GlcNAc 6-
    phosphate and D-lactate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: N-acetylmuramic acid 6-phosphate + H(2)O = N-
    acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate + D-lactate.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate metabolism; N-acetylmuramic acid
    degradation.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: A lyase-type mechanism (beta-elimination/hydration)
    is suggested for the cleavage of the lactyl ether bond of MurNAc
    6-phosphate, with the formation of a 2,3-unsaturated sugar
    intermediate, delta2,3-GlcNAc-6P (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GCKR-like family. MurNAc-6-P etherase
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SIS domain.
