AC   Q5HLY1;
Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein A.
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Together with moaC, is involved in the conversion of a
    guanosine derivative (5'-GTP) into molybdopterin precursor Z (By
    similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 4Fe-4S clusters. Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster
    coordinated with 3 cysteines and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-
    methionine and 1 4Fe-4S cluster coordinated with 3 cysteines and
    the GTP-derived substrate (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; molybdopterin biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer and homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the radical SAM superfamily. MoaA family.
