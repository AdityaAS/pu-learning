Imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.19) (IGPD).
"Histidine biosynthesis genes in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.";
"Gene inactivation in Lactococcus lactis: histidine biosynthesis.";
"The complete genome sequence of the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus
lactis ssp. lactis IL1403.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-erythro-1-(imidazol-4-yl)glycerol 3-
    phosphate = 3-(imidazol-4-yl)-2-oxopropyl phosphate + H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-histidine biosynthesis; L-
    histidine from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate: step 6.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase
    family.
-!- CAUTION: This protein is inactive in the dairy strain IL1403. The
    histidine biosynthesis pathway is not functional in the dairy
    strain IL1403.
