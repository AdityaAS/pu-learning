-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the desulfonation of aliphatic sulfonates (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: An alkanesufonate (R-CH(2)-SO(3)H) + FMNH(2) +
    O(2) = an aldehyde (R-CHO) + FMN + sulfite + H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: FMNH(2) which is absolutely required for this
    enzymatic reaction, is provided by ssuE (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ssuD family.
