AC   P27774;
Phosphoribulokinase, chloroplast precursor (EC 2.7.1.19)
(Phosphopentokinase) (PRKase) (PRK).
"Phosphoribulokinase from ice plant: transcription, transcripts and
protein expression during environmental stress.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + D-ribulose 5-phosphate = ADP + D-
    ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Light regulated via thioredoxin by reversible
    oxidation/reduction of sulfhydryl/disulfide groups.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate biosynthesis; Calvin cycle.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphoribulokinase family.
ATP-binding; Calvin cycle; Chloroplast; Kinase; Nucleotide-binding;
