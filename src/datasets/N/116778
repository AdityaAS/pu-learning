Nuclear pore complex protein Nup93 (Nucleoporin Nup93) (93 kDa
nucleoporin).
"Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes. III.
The coding sequences of 40 new genes (KIAA0081-KIAA0120) deduced by
analysis of cDNA clones from human cell line KG-1.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Nup93, a vertebrate homologue of yeast Nic96p, forms a complex with a
novel 205-kDa protein and is required for correct nuclear pore
assembly.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the nucleoporin complex; required for correct
    nuclear pore assembly.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the p62 complex, a complex composed of
    NUP62, NUP54. Interacts also with NUP205.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nuclear pore complex.
    Note=Localizes at the nuclear basket and at or near the nuclear
    entry to the gated channel of the pore.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nucleoporin interacting component (NIC)
    family.
