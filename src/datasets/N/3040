AC   Q7M9W1;
Acyl carrier protein (ACP).
"Complete genome sequence and analysis of Wolinella succinogenes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Carrier of the growing fatty acid chain in fatty acid
    biosynthesis (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: De novo fatty acid biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- PTM: 4'-phosphopantetheine is transferred from CoA to a specific
    serine of apo-ACP by acpS. This modification is essential for
    activity because fatty acids are bound in thioester linkage to the
    sulfhydryl of the prosthetic group (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 acyl carrier domain.
Complete proteome; Fatty acid biosynthesis; Lipid synthesis;
