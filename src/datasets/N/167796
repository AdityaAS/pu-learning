AC   Q5BBV9;
RuvB-like helicase 1 (EC 3.6.1.-).
"Sequencing of Aspergillus nidulans and comparative analysis with A.
fumigatus and A. oryzae.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA helicase which participates in several chromatin
    remodeling complexes, including the SWR1 and the INO80 complexes.
    The SWR1 complex mediates the ATP-dependent exchange of histone
    H2A for the H2A variant HZT1 leading to transcriptional regulation
    of selected genes by chromatin remodeling. The INO80 complex
    remodels chromatin by shifting nucleosomes and is involved in DNA
    repair. Also involved in pre-rRNA processing (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: May form heterododecamers with RVB2. Component of the
    SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex, the INO80 chromatin remodeling
    complex, and of the R2TP complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ruvB family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
