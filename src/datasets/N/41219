AC   P17556;
Alanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.1).
"Alanine dehydrogenases from two Bacillus species with distinct
thermostabilities: molecular cloning, DNA and protein sequence
determination, and structural comparison with other NAD(P)(+)-
dependent dehydrogenases.";
-!- FUNCTION: This enzyme is a key factor in the assimilation of L-
    alanine as an energy source through the tricarboxylic acid cycle
    during sporulation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-alanine + H(2)O + NAD(+) = pyruvate + NH(3)
    + NADH.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Temperature dependence:
      Loses about 50% of its initial activity when heated at 65
      degrees Celsius for 5 min;
-!- SUBUNIT: Homohexamer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the AlaDH/PNT family.
Direct protein sequencing; NAD; Oxidoreductase.
