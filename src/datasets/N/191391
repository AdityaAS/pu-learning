Taste receptor type 2 member 123 (T2R123) (Taste receptor type 2
member 23) (T2R23) (mT2R55) (STC9-2).

gastrointestinal tract and enteroendocrine STC-1 cells.";

-!- FUNCTION: Gustducin-coupled receptor implicated in the perception
    of bitter compounds in the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal
    tract. Signals through PLCB2 and the calcium-regulated cation
    channel TRPM5 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells
    of the tongue and palate epithelium and exclusively in gustducin-
    positive cells. Expressed in the duodenum, antrum and fundus (part
    of the stomach).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Several bitter taste receptors are expressed in a
    single taste receptor cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor T2R family.
-!- CAUTION: This protein was previously referred to as T2R2 but is
    now considered to be an ortholog of rat TAS2R23.
