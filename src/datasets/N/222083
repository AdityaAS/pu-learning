AC   P56785;
Putative membrane protein ycf1.
"Complete structure of the chloroplast genome of Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
-!- FUNCTION: Unknown. Its presence in a non-photosynthetic plant
    (Epifagus virginiana) and experiments in tobacco indicate that it
    may have a function which is probably not related to
    photosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: There is a partial copy of the N-terminus
    (positions 1-343) of ycf1 in the inverted repeat (ycf1-A,
    BAA84433).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ycf1 family.
