AC   Q30WJ0;
Translation initiation factor IF-2.
"Complete sequence of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the essential components for the initiation of
    protein synthesis. Protects formylmethionyl-tRNA from spontaneous
    hydrolysis and promotes its binding to the 30S ribosomal subunits.
    Also involved in the hydrolysis of GTP during the formation of the
    70S ribosomal complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IF-2 family.
 GO:0003924; F:GTPase activity; IEA:HAMAP.
