-!- FUNCTION: Insulin decreases blood glucose concentration. It
    increases cell permeability to monosaccharides, amino acids and
    fatty acids. It accelerates glycolysis, the pentose phosphate
    cycle, and glycogen synthesis in liver.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a B chain and an A chain linked by two
    disulfide bonds.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the insulin family.
