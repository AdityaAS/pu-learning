AC   Q7VRP8;
DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta' chain (EC 2.7.7.6) (RNAP beta'
subunit) (Transcriptase beta' chain) (RNA polymerase beta' subunit).
"The genome sequence of Blochmannia floridanus: comparative analysis
of reduced genomes.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription
    of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as
    substrates.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: The RNAP catalytic core consists of 2 alpha, 1 beta, 1
    beta' and 1 omega subunit. When a sigma factor is associated with
    the core the holoenzyme is formed, which can initiate
    transcription (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA polymerase beta' chain family.
