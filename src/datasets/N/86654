AC   P35509;
Casein kinase I isoform gamma-3 (EC 2.7.11.1) (CKI-gamma 3)
(Fragment).
"Purification of casein kinase I and isolation of cDNAs encoding
multiple casein kinase I-like enzymes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Casein kinases are operationally defined by their
    preferential utilization of acidic proteins such as caseins as
    substrates. It can phosphorylate a large number of proteins.
    Participates in Wnt signaling (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Testis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. Casein
    kinase I subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
ATP-binding; Kinase; Nucleotide-binding; Phosphorylation;
