AC   Q5LVV1;
Histidinol dehydrogenase 1 (EC 1.1.1.23) (HDH 1).
"Genome sequence of Silicibacter pomeroyi reveals adaptations to the
marine environment.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the sequential NAD-dependent oxidations of L-
    histidinol to L-histidinaldehyde and then to L-histidine (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-histidinol + 2 NAD(+) = L-histidine + 2
    NADH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-histidine biosynthesis; L-
    histidine from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate: step 9
    [final step].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the histidinol dehydrogenase family.
