AC   Q12455;
Spermine synthase (EC 2.5.1.22) (Spermidine aminopropyltransferase)
(SPMSY).
"Spermine is not essential for growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae:
identification of the SPE4 gene (spermine synthase) and
characterization of a spe4 deletion mutant.";

"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosylmethioninamine + spermidine = 5'-
    methylthioadenosine + spermine.
-!- PATHWAY: Amine and polyamine biosynthesis; spermine biosynthesis;
    spermine from spermidine: single step [final step].
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 3870 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the spermidine/spermine synthase family.
