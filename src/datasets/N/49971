"The secreted protein discovery initiative (SPDI), a large-scale
effort to identify novel human secreted and transmembrane proteins: a
bioinformatics assessment.";
"Signal peptide prediction based on analysis of experimentally
verified cleavage sites.";
"Epigen, the last ligand of ErbB receptors, reveals intricate

-!- FUNCTION: Promotes the growth of epithelial cells. May stimulate
    the phosphorylation of EGFR and mitogen-activated protein kinases.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 EGF-like domain.
