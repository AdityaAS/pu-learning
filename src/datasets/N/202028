Replication protein E1 (EC 3.6.1.-) (ATP-dependent helicase E1).
"Primer-directed sequencing of human papillomavirus types.";
"Phylogenetic analysis of 48 papillomavirus types and 28 subtypes and
variants: a showcase for the molecular evolution of DNA viruses.";
-!- FUNCTION: ATP-dependent DNA helicase required for initiation of
    viral DNA replication. It forms a complex with the viral E2
    protein. The E1-E2 complex binds to the replication origin which
    contains binding sites for both proteins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the papillomaviruses E1 protein family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SF3 helicase domain.
