AC   Q71Y84;
Menaquinone biosynthesis methyltransferase ubiE (EC 2.1.1.-).
"Whole genome comparisons of serotype 4b and 1/2a strains of the food-
borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes reveal new insights into the
core genome components of this species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Methyltransferase required for the conversion of
    dimethylmenaquinone (DMKH2) to menaquinone (MKH2) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + demethylmenaquinol =
    s-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + menaquinol.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; menaquinone biosynthesis;
    menaquinone from chorismate: step 7 [final step].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily. UbiE
    family.
