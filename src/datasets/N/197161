AC   Q871K1; Q1K6S2;
Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex 14 kDa protein (EC 1.10.2.2)
(Complex III subunit VII).
"What's in the genome of a filamentous fungus? Analysis of the
Neurospora genome sequence.";
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c
    reductase complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), which
    is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This component is
    involved in redox-linked proton pumping (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: QH(2) + 2 ferricytochrome c = Q + 2
    ferrocytochrome c.
-!- SUBUNIT: Fungi bc1 complex contains 10 subunits; 3 respiratory
    subunits, 2 core proteins and 5 low-molecular weight proteins (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UQCRB/QCR7 family.
