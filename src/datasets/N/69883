AC   O49118;
Histone H2B (CaH2B).
"Induction of reproductive organ-preferential histone genes by
wounding or methyl jasmonate.";
-!- FUNCTION: Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and
    compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the
    cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones
    thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA
    repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA
    accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational
    modifications of histones, also called histone code, and
    nucleosome remodelling.
-!- SUBUNIT: The nucleosome is a histone octamer containing two
    molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 assembled in one H3-H4
    heterotetramer and two H2A-H2B heterodimers. The octamer wraps
    approximately 147 bp of DNA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: In anthers, floral buds, pollen, petals and
    fruits.
-!- INDUCTION: By wounding and methyl jasmonate.
-!- PTM: Monoubiquitinated on Lys-140; may give a specific tag for
    epigenetic transcriptional activation (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the histone H2B family.
