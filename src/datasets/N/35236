AC   P25930; Q3MHJ3;
C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXC-R4) (CXCR-4) (Stromal cell-
derived factor 1 receptor) (SDF-1 receptor) (Fusin) (Leukocyte-derived
seven transmembrane domain receptor) (LESTR) (LCR1) (CD184 antigen).
"Sequence and expression of a neuropeptide Y receptor cDNA.";
"Role of chemokines in respiratory syncytial virus infection.";
"A proposed bovine neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor cDNA clone, or its
human homologue, confers neither NPY binding sites nor NPY
responsiveness on transfected cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for the C-X-C chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1.
    Transduces a signal by increasing the intracellular calcium ions
    level.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain, heart, kidney, lung and liver.
-!- PTM: Sulfated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) thought to be a receptor for
    neuropeptide Y type 3 (NPY3R) (NPY3-R).
