Death-associated protein kinase 3 (EC 2.7.11.1) (DAP kinase 3) (DAP-
like kinase) (Dlk) (ZIP-kinase).
"ZIP kinase, a novel serine/threonine kinase which mediates
apoptosis.";
"ZIP kinase identified as a novel myosin regulatory light chain kinase
in HeLa cells.";
"ZIP kinase triggers apoptosis from nuclear PML oncogenic domains.";
"Novel mitosis-specific phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr11
mediated by Dlk/ZIP kinase.";
"Crystal structure of human ZIP kinase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as a positive
    regulator of apoptosis. Phosphorylates histone H3 on 'Thr-11' at
    centromeres during mitosis.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer or forms heterodimers with ATF4. Both
    interactions require an intact leucine zipper domain and
    oligomerization is required for full enzymatic activity. Also
    binds to DAXX and PAWR, possibly in a ternary complex which plays
    a role in caspase activation. Interacts with AATF and CDC5L.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q9UER7:DAXX; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-77293, EBI-77321;
    O35613:Daxx (xeno); NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-77293, EBI-77304;
    O75796:PAWR; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-77293, EBI-77411;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Cytoplasm (By similarity).
    Note=Relocates to the cytoplasm on binding PAWR where the complex
    appears to interact with actin filaments (By similarity).
    Associates to centromeres from prophase to anaphase.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. DAP
    kinase subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
