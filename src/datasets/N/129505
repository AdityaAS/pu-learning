Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit alpha
isoform (EC 3.1.3.16) (PP2A-alpha).
"Nucleotide sequence of a rat heart cDNA encoding the isotype alpha of
the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A.";
"Molecular cloning of cDNA for the catalytic subunit of rat liver type
2A protein phosphatase, and detection of high levels of expression of
the gene in normal and cancer cells.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: PP2A can modulate the activity of phosphorylase B kinase
    casein kinase 2, mitogen-stimulated S6 kinase, and MAP-2 kinase
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A phosphoprotein + H(2)O = a protein +
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 iron ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 manganese ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: PP2A consists of a common heterodimeric core enzyme,
    composed of a 36 kDa catalytic subunit (subunit C) and a 65 kDa
    constant regulatory subunit (PR65 or subunit A), that associates
    with a variety of regulatory subunits. Proteins that associate
    with the core dimer include three families of regulatory subunits
    B (the R2/B/PR55/B55, R3/B''/PR72/PR130/PR59 and R5/B'/B56
    families), the 48 kDa variable regulatory subunit, viral proteins,
    and cell signaling molecules (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Reversibly methyl esterified on Leu-309. Carboxyl methylation
    may play a role in holoenzyme assembly. It varies during the cell
    cycle (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylation of either threonine (by autophosphorylation-
    activated protein kinase) or tyrosine results in inactivation of
    the phosphatase. Auto-dephosphorylation has been suggested as a
    mechanism for reactivation (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PPP phosphatase family. PP-1 subfamily.
