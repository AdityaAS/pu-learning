-!- FUNCTION: Binds 16S rRNA, required for the assembly of 30S
    particles and may also be responsible for determining the
    conformation of the 16S rRNA at the A site.
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts proteins S3
    and S10 (By similarity).
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=11449.3; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=1-100;
    NOTE=Ref.5.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S14P family.
