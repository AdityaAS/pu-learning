AC   Q2UTP0;
GPI mannosyltransferase 4 (EC 2.4.1.-) (GPI mannosyltransferase IV)
(GPI-MT-IV).
"Genome sequencing and analysis of Aspergillus oryzae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase involved in
    glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis. Transfers a
    fourth mannose to trimannosyl-GPIs during GPI precursor assembly.
    The presence of a fourth mannose in GPI is essential in fungi (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Glycolipid biosynthesis; glycosylphosphatidylinositol-
    anchor biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 22 family. PIGZ
    subfamily.
