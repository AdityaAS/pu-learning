AC   Q9I471;
Cobyrinic acid A,C-diamide synthase.
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the amidation of carboxylic groups at
    position A and C of either cobyrinic acid or hydrogenobrynic acid.
    NH(2) groups are provided by glutamine, and one molecule of ATP is
    hydrogenolyzed for each amidation (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis;
    cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide from precorrin-2 (aerobic route):
    step 9.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cobB/cobQ family. CobB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 GATase cobBQ-type domain.
 GO:0015420; F:cobalamin-transporting ATPase activity; IEA:HAMAP.
Cobalamin biosynthesis; Complete proteome; Porphyrin biosynthesis.
