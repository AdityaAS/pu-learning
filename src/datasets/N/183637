Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.2) (Tryptophan--tRNA ligase)
(TrpRS).
"Comparative analyses of the complete genome sequences of Pierce's
disease and citrus variegated chlorosis strains of Xylella
fastidiosa.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-tryptophan + tRNA(Trp) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-tryptophyl-tRNA(Trp).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
