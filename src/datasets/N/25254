AC   P62646; Q73PZ6;
Chemotaxis response regulator protein-glutamate methylesterase
(EC 3.1.1.61).
"Comparison of the genome of the oral pathogen Treponema denticola
with other spirochete genomes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the modulation of the chemotaxis system;
    catalyzes the demethylation of specific methylglutamate residues
    introduced into the chemoreceptors (methyl-accepting chemotaxis
    proteins) by cheR (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein L-glutamate 5-O-methyl ester + H(2)O =
    protein L-glutamate + methanol.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal regulatory domain inhibits the activity of
    the C-terminal effector domain.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by cheA. Phosphorylation suppresses the
    inhibitory activity of the N-terminal domain (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 cheB-type methylesterase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 response regulatory domain.
