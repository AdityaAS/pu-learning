-!- FUNCTION: Has 5'-polynucleotide kinase and nicking endonuclease
    activity. May play a role in DNA repair or recombination.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds NEDD4 (By similarity). Binds BCL3 and CREBBP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q86UW6-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q86UW6-2; Sequence=VSP_009721;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- DOMAIN: The Smr domain has nicking endonuclease activity, but no
    significant double strand cleavage or exonuclease activity.
-!- PTM: Ubiquitinated; this targets the protein for degradation by
    the proteasome (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CUE domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Smr domain.
