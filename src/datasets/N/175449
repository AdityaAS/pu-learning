-!- FUNCTION: Cell adhesion protein that promotes the attachment of
    spinal cord and sensory neuron cells and the outgrowth of neurites
    in vitro. May contribute to the growth and guidance of axons in
    both the spinal cord and the PNS (By similarity). Major factor for
    vascular smooth muscle cell.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds to the central extracellular domain of APP and
    inhibits beta-secretase cleavage of APP (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein; extracellular space;
    extracellular matrix (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highest expression in lung, lower expression
    in brain, heart, kidney, liver and testis, and lowest expression
    in pancreas, skeletal muscle and ovary. Not expressed in spleen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 reelin domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 spondin domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 TSP type-1 domains.
