AC   P29951;
Mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.8) (Phosphomannose isomerase)
(PMI) (Phosphohexomutase).
"Purification, cDNA cloning and heterologous expression of human
phosphomannose isomerase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the synthesis of the GDP-mannose and
    dolichol-phosphate-mannose required for a number of critical
    mannosyl transfer reactions.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-mannose 6-phosphate = D-fructose 6-
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Glycosylation; early steps of mannosylation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase type 1
    family.
Isomerase; Metal-binding; Zinc.
