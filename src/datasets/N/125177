AC   P20786;
Alpha platelet-derived growth factor receptor precursor (EC 2.7.10.1)
(PDGF-R-alpha) (CD140a antigen).
"Isolation and characterization of the alpha platelet-derived growth
factor receptor from rat olfactory epithelium.";
"Conservation in sequence and affinity of human and rodent PDGF
ligands and receptors.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor that binds both PDGFA and PDGFB and has a
    tyrosine-protein kinase activity.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + a
    [protein]-L-tyrosine phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer, and heterodimer with PDGFRB. Interacts with
    SHB (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tyr protein kinase family. CSF-1/PDGF
    receptor subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
