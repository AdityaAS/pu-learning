-!- FUNCTION: Participates in the formation of a gel matrix (sperm
    coagulum) entrapping the accessory gland secretions and ejaculated
    spermatozoa.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Seminal vesicles, and to a much lesser extent,
    epididymis.
-!- PTM: Semenogelin-2 is thought to form both the 71 kDa polypeptide
    and, in its glycosylated form, the 76 kDa polypeptide.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the semenogelin family.
