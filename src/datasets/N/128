-!- FUNCTION: Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large
    spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathway. Binds
    to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a
    phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results
    in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Interacts with MLLT7/FOXO4, PCTK1 and SSH1.
    Binds to the C-terminal part of WEE1 (By similarity). Interacts
    with BSPRY.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in brain (at protein level).
-!- PTM: Isoform delta differs from isoform zeta in being
    phosphorylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 14-3-3 family.
