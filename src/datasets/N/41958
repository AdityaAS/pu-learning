AC   P31989;
Disintegrin jararacin (Platelet aggregation activation inhibitor).
"Characterization of the integrin specificities of disintegrins
isolated from American pit viper venoms.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits fibrinogen interaction with platelet receptors
    expressed on glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Acts by binding to the
    glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor on the platelet surface and
    inhibits aggregation induced by ADP, thrombin, platelet-activating
    factor and collagen.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the disintegrin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 disintegrin domain.
Blood coagulation; Cell adhesion; Direct protein sequencing.
