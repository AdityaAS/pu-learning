Nuclear distribution protein nudE homolog 1-A (Mitotic phosphoprotein
43) (MP43).
"Systematic identification of mitotic phosphoproteins.";
"LIS1 regulates CNS lamination by interacting with mNudE, a central
component of the centrosome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for centrosome duplication and formation and
    function of the mitotic spindle (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Self-associates. Interacts with pafah1b1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Centrosome (By
    similarity). Spindle (By similarity). Note=Localizes to the
    interphase centrosome and to the mitotic spindle (By similarity).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Strongly expressed in the eye, branchial
    arches and telencephalon of stage 26-33 embryos.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated in mitosis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nudE family.
