-!- FUNCTION: Adapter protein which regulates several signal
    transduction cascades by linking activated receptors to downstream
    signaling components. May play a role in angiogenesis by
    regulating FGFR1, VEGFR2 and PDGFR signaling. May also play a role
    in T-cell antigen receptor/TCR signaling, interleukin-2 signaling,
    apoptosis and neuronal cells differentiation by mediating basic-
    FGF and NGF-induced signaling cascades. May also regulate IRS1 and
    IRS2 signaling in insulin-producing cells (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with the ligand-activated receptors PDGFRA,
    PDGFRB, FGFR1, KDR/VEGFR2, IL2RB and IL2RG. Interacts with EPS8
    and V-SRC. Interacts with GRB2 and GRAP. Interacts with CD3Z.
    Interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT upon T-cell antigen
    receptor activation. Interacts with PLCG1. Interacts with ZAP70,
    LCP2/SLP-76, VAV1 and GRAP2. Interacts with JAK1 and JAK3.
    Interacts with PTK2/FAK1. Interacts with CRK/CrKII. Interacts with
    IRS2 (By similarity). Interacts with PTPN11.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Note=Associates
    with membrane lipid rafts upon TCR stimulation (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q6PD21-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q6PD21-2; Sequence=VSP_019848, VSP_019849, VSP_019850;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in heart, liver, brain and kidney
    (at protein level).
-!- INDUCTION: Up-regulated by okadaic acid and genistein.
-!- DOMAIN: The SH2 domain preferentially binds phosphopeptides with
    the consensus sequence Y-[TVI]-X-L and mediates interaction with
    PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGRFR1, IL2RB, IL2RG, CD3Z and CRK/CrKII (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated upon PDGFRA, PDGFRB, TCR, IL2 receptor, FGRF1
    or VEGFR2 activation (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SH2 domain.
