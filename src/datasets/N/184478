AC   Q5QD14;
Trace amine-associated receptor 5.
"Trace amine-associated receptors form structurally and functionally
distinct subfamilies of novel G protein-coupled receptors.";
-!- FUNCTION: Orphan receptor. Ligands are likely small molecules,
    either sharing some similarities with trace amine as, e.g.
    derivatives of indolamines (such as 5-methoxytryptamine) or of
    phenylethylamines (such as phenylethanolamine) or being any kind
    of metabolite of amino acids or biogenic amine neurotransmitters.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
G-protein coupled receptor; Glycoprotein; Membrane; Receptor;
Transducer; Transmembrane.
