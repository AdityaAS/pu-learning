AC   Q5EN22;
Sterol 24-C-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.41) (Delta(24)-sterol C-
methyltransferase).
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine
    to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 5-alpha-cholesta-
    8,24-dien-3-beta-ol = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 24-methylene-5-
    alpha-cholest-8-en-3-beta-ol.
-!- PATHWAY: Ergosterol biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily. ERG6
    family.
