AC   P31226;
Saxiphilin precursor (SAX).
"Molecular cloning of bullfrog saxiphilin: a unique relative of the
transferrin family that binds saxitoxin.";
"Purification and partial sequencing of saxiphilin, a saxitoxin-
binding protein from the bullfrog, reveals homology to transferrin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds specifically to the neurotoxin saxitoxin. Its
    physiological role may be to transport or sequester an endogenous
    organic molecule other than Fe(3+). It may participate in a
    detoxification mechanism for neutralizing a microbial toxin.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Plasma. Highest levels of transcripts found in
    the liver, the lung, the pancreas and the brain.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The peptidase S60 domains do not have protease
    function as the catalytic residues are missing.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transferrin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 peptidase S60 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 thyroglobulin type-1 domains.
