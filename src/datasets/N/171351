Developmental protein SEPALLATA3 (Agamous-like MADS-box protein AGL9).
"The Arabidopsis AGL9 MADS box gene is expressed in young flower
primordia.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Full-length cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana.";
"Functional annotation of a full-length Arabidopsis cDNA collection.";
"Specific interactions between the K domains of AG and AGLs, members
of the MADS domain family of DNA binding proteins.";
"B and C floral organ identity functions require SEPALLATA MADS-box
genes.";
"Complexes of MADS-box proteins are sufficient to convert leaves into
floral organs.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable transcription factor active in inflorescence
    development and floral organogenesis. Functions with
    SEPALLATA1/AGL2 and SEPALLATA2/AGL4 to ensure proper development
    of petals, stamens and carpels and to prevent the indeterminate
    growth of the flower meristem. Interacts with APETALA1, AGAMOUS or
    APETALA3/PISTILLATA to form complexes, that could be involved in
    genes regulation during floral meristem development.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer with AP1 or AG capable of binding to CArG-box
    sequences. Binds AP3/PI to form a ternary complex.

-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).

    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;

    Name=2;
      IsoId=O22456-2; Sequence=VSP_008893;
      Note=May be due to a competing acceptor splice site. No
      experimental confirmation available;
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed early during flower development
    within petals, stamens, and carpels.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Triple mutations in the SEP1, SEP2 and SEP3 genes
    result in the replacement of the stamens and petals by sepals and
    of the carpels by a new mutant flower with sepaloid organs.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 K-box domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 MADS-box domain.
