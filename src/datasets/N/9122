AC   Q980X0;
Acetylglutamate/acetylaminoadipate kinase (EC 2.7.2.8) (EC 2.7.2.-)
(NAG kinase) (AGK) (N-acetyl-L-glutamate/N-acetyl-L-aminoadipate 5-
phosphotransferase).
"The complete genome of the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2.";
"The Sulfolobus solfataricus Lrp-like protein LysM regulates lysine
biosynthesis in response to lysine availability.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in both the arginine and lysine biosynthetic
    pathways.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + N-acetyl-L-glutamate = ADP + N-acetyl-L-
    glutamate 5-phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + N-acetyl-L-aminoadipate = ADP + N-
    acetyl-L-aminoadipate 5-phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-arginine biosynthesis; 2-N-
    acetyl-L-ornithine from L-glutamate: step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-lysine biosynthesis via AAA
    pathway; L-lysine from L-alpha-aminoadipate (Thermus route): step
    2.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-lysine biosynthesis via AAA
    pathway; L-lysine from L-alpha-aminoadipate (Thermus route): step
    2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acetylglutamate kinase family.
