AC   P21609;
Thioredoxin (TRX).
"Glycine reductase of Clostridium litorale. Cloning, sequencing, and
molecular analysis of the grdAB operon that contains two in-frame TGA
codons for selenium incorporation.";
"Thioredoxin elicits a new dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase activity by
interaction with the electron-transferring flavoprotein in Clostridium
litoralis and Eubacterium acidaminophilum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Participates in various redox reactions through the
    reversible oxidation of its active center dithiol to a disulfide
    and catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the thioredoxin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 thioredoxin domain.
