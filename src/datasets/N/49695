AC   Q8Z8L9;
4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase entD (EC 2.7.8.-) (Enterobactin
synthetase component D) (Enterochelin synthase D).
"Complete genome sequence of a multiple drug resistant Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi CT18.";
"Comparative genomics of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi strains Ty2
and CT18.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the transfer of the 4'-phosphopantetheine
    moiety from coenzyme A to apo-domains of both entB (an ArCP
    domain) and entF (a PCP domain). Plays an essential role in the
    assembly of the enterobactin (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CoA + apo-entB/F = adenosine 3',5'-
    bisphosphate + holo-entB/F.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Siderophore biosynthesis; enterobactin biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: EntB, entD, entE, and entF form a multienzyme complex
    called enterobactin synthetase (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the P-Pant transferase superfamily. EntD
    family.
