Sterol 3-beta-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.173) (Autophagy-related
protein 26) (UDP-glycosyltransferase 51).
"Cloning and functional expression of UGT genes encoding sterol
glucosyltransferases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans,
Pichia pastoris, and Dictyostelium discoideum.";
"The diploid genome sequence of Candida albicans.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in decane metabolism and autophagy (By
    similarity). Involved in the biosynthesis of sterol glucoside.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-glucose + a sterol = UDP + a sterol 3-
    beta-D-glucoside.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Membrane;
    peripheral membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 28 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 GRAM domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PH domain.
