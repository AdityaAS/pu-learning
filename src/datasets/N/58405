Gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase 1 (EC 1.14.11.13) (Gibberellin 2-beta-
hydroxylase 1) (Gibberellin 2-oxidase 1) (GA 2-oxidase 1) (Protein
SLENDER).
"The SLENDER gene of pea encodes a gibberellin 2-oxidase.";
"Gibberellin 2-oxidation and the SLN gene of Pisum sativum.";
"Purification and kinetic studies of recombinant gibberellin
dioxygenases.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the 2-beta-hydroxylation of several
    biologically active gibberellins, leading to the homeostatic
    regulation of their endogenous level. Catabolism of gibberellins
    (GAs) plays a central role in plant development. Converts GA9/GA20
    to GA51/GA29 and GA4/GA1 to GA34/GA8.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Gibberellin 1 + 2-oxoglutarate + O(2) = 2-
    beta-hydroxygibberellin 1 + succinate + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Iron (By similarity).
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=0.024 uM for GA20;
      Vmax=4.4 pmol/sec/mg enzyme;
-!- PATHWAY: Gibberellins catabolism: later steps.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominantly expressed in roots, flowers,
    young fruits and seeds.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Defects in GA2ox1 lead to the slender phenotype,
    characterized by large amounts of GA20 that cannot be degraded,
    and is metabolized to excess GA1 on germination, producing plants
    with a characteristic slender or hyperelongated phenotype.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the iron/ascorbate-dependent oxidoreductase
    family. GA2OX subfamily.
