AC   P31802; Q2MAQ0;
Nitrate/nitrite response regulator protein narP.
"Dual response regulators (NarL and NarP) interact with dual sensors
(NarX and NarQ) to control nitrate- and nitrite-regulated gene
expression in Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Automated multiplex sequencing of the E.coli genome.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein activates the expression of the nitrate
    reductase (narGHJI) and formate dehydrogenase-N (fdnGHI) operons
    and represses the transcription of the fumarate reductase
    (frdABCD) operon in response to a nitrate/nitrite induction signal
    transmitted by either the narX or narQ proteins.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HTH luxR-type DNA-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 response regulatory domain.
