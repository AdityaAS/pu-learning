AC   Q7S7C5;
Palmitoyltransferase PFA3 (EC 2.3.1.-) (Protein fatty acyltransferase
3).
"What's in the genome of a filamentous fungus? Analysis of the
Neurospora genome sequence.";
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Palmitoyltransferase specific for VAC8. Palmitoylates
    VAC8 at one or more of its N-terminal cysteine residues, which is
    required for its proper membrane localization (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Palmitoyl-CoA + protein-cysteine = S-palmitoyl
    protein + CoA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The DHHC domain is required for palmitoyltransferase
    activity (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Autopalmitoylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DHHC palmitoyltransferase family. PFA3
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DHHC-type zinc finger.
