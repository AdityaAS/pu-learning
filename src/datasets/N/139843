"Bovine coronavirus (Quebec strain) full-length genomic sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: The replicase polyprotein of coronaviruses is a
    multifunctional protein: it contains the activities necessary for
    the transcription of negative stranded RNA, leader RNA, subgenomic
    mRNAs and progeny virion RNA as well as proteinases responsible
    for the cleavage of the polyprotein into functional products.
-!- FUNCTION: The papain-like proteinase 1 (PL1-PRO) and papain-like
    proteinase 2 (PL2-PRO) are responsible for the cleavages located
    at the N-terminus of the replicase polyprotein. Activity of PL1-
    PRO is strongly dependent on zinc (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: The main proteinase 3CL-PRO is responsible for the
    majority of cleavages as it cleaves the C-terminus of replicase
    polyprotein at 11 sites. Recognizes substrates containing the core
    sequence [ILMVF]-Q-|-[SAGC]. Inhibited by the substrate-analog
    Cbz-Val-Asn-Ser-Thr-Leu-Gln-CMK (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: The helicase which contains a zinc finger structure
    displays RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding activities with 5' to 3'
    polarity. ATPase activity is strongly stimulated by poly(U),
    poly(dT), poly(C), poly(dA), but not by poly(G) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: 3CL-PRO exists as monomer and homodimer. The Cys-rich
    growth factor-like peptide forms a homodimer; disulfide-linked (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The hydrophobic domains (HD) could mediate the membrane
    association of the replication complex and thereby alter the
    architecture of the host cell membrane.
-!- PTM: Specific enzymatic cleavages in vivo by its own proteases
    yield mature proteins. 3CL-PRO and PL-PRO proteinases are
    autocatalytically processed (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein is translated as a 1a-1b polyprotein
    by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. The 1A polyprotein is
    produced by itself but not the 1B polyprotein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Macro domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 peptidase C16 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase C30 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RdRp catalytic domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 viral helicase-type zinc finger.
