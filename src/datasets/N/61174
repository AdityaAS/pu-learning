AC   Q6HDT8;
Probable glycine dehydrogenase [decarboxylating] subunit 2
(EC 1.4.4.2) (Glycine decarboxylase subunit 2) (Glycine cleavage
system P-protein subunit 2).
"Pathogenomic sequence analysis of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus
thuringiensis isolates closely related to Bacillus anthracis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the degradation of
    glycine. The P protein binds the alpha-amino group of glycine
    through its pyridoxal phosphate cofactor; CO(2) is released and
    the remaining methylamine moiety is then transferred to the
    lipoamide cofactor of the H protein (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Glycine + H-protein-lipoyllysine = H-protein-
    S-aminomethyldihydrolipoyllysine + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The glycine cleavage system is composed of four proteins:
    P, T, L and H. In this organism, the P 'protein' is an heterodimer
    of two subunits (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gcvP family. C-terminal subunit
    subfamily.
