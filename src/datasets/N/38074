Protein C' [Contains: Protein C; Protein Y1; Protein Y2].
"Sendai virus contains overlapping genes expressed from a single
mRNA.";
"Ribosomal initiation from an ACG codon in the Sendai virus P/C
mRNA.";
"A point mutation in the Sendai virus accessory C proteins attenuates
virulence for mice, but not virus growth in cell culture.";
"Proteolytic processing and translation initiation: two independent
mechanisms for the expression of the Sendai virus Y proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: The different products prevent the establishment of
    cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta
    (IFN-alpha/beta) and IFN-gamma signaling pathways. They inhibit
    IFN-alpha/beta induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and
    STAT2. Blocking the IFN-alpha/beta pathway requires binding to
    STAT1 in the cytoplasm. They inhibit IFN-gamma induced serine
    phosphorylation of STAT1. Block the IFN-gamma pathway in a STAT1-
    binding independent mechanism, preventing the GAF (tyrosine-
    phosphorylated STAT1 dimer) to bind its promoter in the nucleus.
    May also have a role in preventing the cell to enter apoptosis.
    Modulate regulation of viral transcription and replication.
    Overexpression inhibits the viral RNA polymerase. The absence of
    all C', C, Y1 and Y2 proteins leads to viral delayed growth. Plays
    an important role in virion particles release. Modulates virion
    shape (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The different products bind the N-terminal part of
    unphosphorylated and phosphorylated human STAT1, preventing the
    formation of STAT1 homodimers and STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers (By
    similarity). The binding of C protein to L protein has an
    inhibitory effect on viral transcription and replication (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Note=Protein C' seems to localize
    around the Golgi.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative initiation; Named isoforms=4;
    Name=C';
      IsoId=P04861-1; Sequence=Displayed;
      Note=The initiator methionine is coded by an unusual start codon
      ACG;
    Name=C;
      IsoId=P04861-2; Sequence=VSP_018933;
      Note=Most abundant isoform in infected cells;
    Name=Y1;
      IsoId=P04861-3; Sequence=VSP_018934;
    Name=Y2;
      IsoId=P04861-4; Sequence=VSP_018935;
-!- PTM: Y1 and Y2 proteins are produced not only by alternative
    initiation, but also by preoteolytic cleavage of C'. Only
    alternative initiation is detected in vitro, whereas in vivo
    cleavage seems to be predominant.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The C protein is found in virion at a ratio of
    approximately 40 molecules per virion, presumably associated with
    the nucleocapsid (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The P/V/C gene has two overlapping open reading
    frames. One encodes the P/V/W proteins and the other the C/Y
    proteins.
-!- CAUTION: The C' protein uses an unusual ACG start codon.
