AC   Q8RPN9;
Cytochrome c-type biogenesis protein ccmE (Cytochrome c maturation
protein E) (Heme chaperone ccmE).
"The cytochrome c maturation locus of Legionella pneumophila promotes
iron assimilation and intracellular infection and contains a strain-
specific insertion sequence element.";
-!- FUNCTION: Heme chaperone required for the biogenesis of c-type
    cytochromes. Transiently binds heme delivered by ccmC and
    transfers the heme to apo-cytochromes in a process facilitated by
    ccmF and ccmH (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass type II
    membrane protein; periplasmic side (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ccmE/cycJ family.
