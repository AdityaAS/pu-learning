AC   Q20YV7;
S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 2 (EC 2.5.1.6) (Methionine
adenosyltransferase 2) (AdoMet synthetase 2) (MAT 2).
"Complete sequence of Rhodopseudomonas palustris BisB18.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylmethionine from
    methionine and ATP. The overall synthetic reaction is composed of
    two sequential steps, AdoMet formation and the subsequent
    tripolyphosphate hydrolysis which occurs prior to release of
    AdoMet from the enzyme (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-methionine + H(2)O = phosphate +
    diphosphate + S-adenosyl-L-methionine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 divalent ions per subunit. Magnesium or Cobalt
    (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 potassium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; S-adenosyl-L-methionine
    biosynthesis; S-adenosyl-L-methionine from L-methionine: single
    step [final step].
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Activated methyl cycle.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the AdoMet synthetase family.
