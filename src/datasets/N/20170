AC   Q8E5F5;
Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase large chain (EC 6.3.5.5) (Carbamoyl-
phosphate synthetase ammonia chain).
"Genome sequence of Streptococcus agalactiae, a pathogen causing
invasive neonatal disease.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 ATP + L-glutamine + HCO(3)(-) + H(2)O = 2
    ADP + phosphate + L-glutamate + carbamoyl phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 3 manganese ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-arginine biosynthesis;
    carbamoyl phosphate from HCO(3)(-): single step.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; UMP biosynthesis; UMP from
    HCO(3)(-): step 1.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; UMP biosynthesis; UMP from
    HCO(3)(-): step 1.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Pyrimidine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of two chains; the small (or glutamine) chain
    promotes the hydrolysis of glutamine to ammonia, which is used by
    the large (or ammonia) chain to synthesize carbamoyl phosphate (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the carB family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ATP-grasp domains.
