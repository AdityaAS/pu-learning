Homeobox protein GBX-2 (Gastrulation and brain-specific homeobox
protein 2).
"Characterization and sequence analysis of the human homeobox-
containing gene GBX2.";
"Enhanced GBX2 expression induces the growth of human prostate cancer
cells via transcriptional stimulation of the interleukin-6 gene.";
"Generation and annotation of the DNA sequences of human chromosomes 2
and 4.";
"The HOX complex neighbored by the EVX gene, as well as two other
homeobox-containing genes, the GBX-class and the EN-class, are located
on the same chromosomes 2 and 7 in humans.";
