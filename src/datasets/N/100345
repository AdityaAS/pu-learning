AC   Q27522;
Probable S-adenosylmethionine synthetase tag-32 (EC 2.5.1.6)
(Methionine adenosyltransferase) (AdoMet synthetase).
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylmethionine from
    methionine and ATP (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-methionine + H(2)O = phosphate +
    diphosphate + S-adenosyl-L-methionine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 divalent ions per subunit. Magnesium or Cobalt
    (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 potassium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; S-adenosyl-L-methionine
    biosynthesis; S-adenosyl-L-methionine from L-methionine: single
    step [final step].
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Activated methyl cycle.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
