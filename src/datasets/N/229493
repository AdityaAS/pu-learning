AC   Q9UU83;
Protein pal1 (Pears and lemons protein 1).
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"Two-hybrid search for proteins that interact with Sad1 and Kms1, two
membrane-bound components of the spindle pole body in fission yeast.";
"The novel fission yeast protein Pal1p interacts with Hip1-related
Sla2p/End4p and is involved in cellular morphogenesis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in cellular morphogenesis and cell wall
    integrity. Important for the maintenance of a cylindrical cell
    shape.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with end4 and sad1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein.
    Note=Localizes to cell tips during interphase and to the medial
    ring during mitosis and cytokinesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pal1 family.
