"Whole-genome sequence analysis of Pseudomonas syringae pv.
phaseolicola 1448A reveals divergence among pathovars in genes
involved in virulence and transposition.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group to glutamate
    to form glutamate 5-phosphate which rapidly cyclizes to 5-
    oxoproline.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-glutamate = ADP + L-glutamate 5-
    phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-proline biosynthesis; L-
    glutamate 5-semialdehyde from L-glutamate: step 1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glutamate 5-kinase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PUA domain.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Complete proteome; Kinase;
Proline biosynthesis; Transferase.
