AC   Q8NVH4;
Hydroxyethylthiazole kinase (EC 2.7.1.50) (4-methyl-5-beta-
hydroxyethylthiazole kinase) (Thz kinase) (TH kinase).
"Genome and virulence determinants of high virulence community-
acquired MRSA.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 4-methyl-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiazole =
    ADP + 4-methyl-5-(2-phosphoethyl)thiazole.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; thiamine pyrophosphate
    biosynthesis; 4-methyl-5-(2-phosphoethyl)-thiazole from 4-methyl-
    5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-thiazole: single step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Thz kinase family.
