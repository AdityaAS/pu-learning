AC   Q8PVP6;
Lysyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (EC 6.1.1.6) (Lysine--tRNA ligase 2) (LysRS
2).
"The genome of Methanosarcina mazei: evidence for lateral gene
transfer between Bacteria and Archaea.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-lysine + tRNA(Lys) = AMP + diphosphate
    + L-lysyl-tRNA(Lys).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 3 magnesium ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
