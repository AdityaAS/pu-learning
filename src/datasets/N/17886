-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in the modulation of E3 ubiquitin ligase
    activity of the 2-subunit BRCA1/BARD1 complex. May play a role in
    homeostasis or cellular differentiation in cells of neural,
    epithelial and germ line origins. Probably functions as a death
    receptor-associated anti-apoptotic protein, which inhibits the
    mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. May regulate TNF-alpha signaling
    through its interactions with TNFRSF1A.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the BRCA1/BRCA2 containing complex (BRCC),
    which also contains BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1, BRCC3 and RAD51. BRCC is
    a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex that enhances cellular survival
    following DNA damage. Interacts with FAS and TNFRSF1A.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Note=Mainly cytoplasmic.
    Also found in the nucleus.

    Name=3; Synonyms=Alpha a';
      IsoId=Q9NXR7-3; Sequence=VSP_051957;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in all cell lines examined. Highly
    expressed in placenta.
-!- INDUCTION: Down-regulated by DNA-damaging agents in fibroblasts,
    by retinoic acid in brain glioma U-251 and promyelocytic HL-60
    cell lines, and by LPS in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
    (PBMC).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the BRE family.
