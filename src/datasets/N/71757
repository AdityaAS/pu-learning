"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Selective regulation of class I and II histone deacetylase expression
in cultured neural cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues on
    the N-terminal part of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4).
    Histone deacetylation gives a tag for epigenetic repression and
    plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle
    progression and developmental events. Histone deacetylases act via
    the formation of large multiprotein complexes (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q8VH37-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q8VH37-2; Sequence=VSP_007178, VSP_007179;
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Its activity is inhibited by trichostatin A (TSA)
    and butyrate, two well known histone deacetylase inhibitors.
    histone deacetylase inhibitor (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the histone deacetylase family. Type 1
    subfamily.
