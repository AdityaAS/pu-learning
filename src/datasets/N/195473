Muscarinic toxin beta (MT-beta).
"Muscarinic toxins from the black mamba Dendroaspis polylepis.";
"Protein toxins that bind to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.";
"Kinetic evidence for different mechanisms of interaction of black
mamba toxins MT alpha and MT beta with muscarinic receptors.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds reversibly to the muscarinic acetylcholine
    receptor. The mechanism of toxin-receptor interaction comprise one
    step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the snake toxin family. Type A muscarinic
    toxin subfamily.
Acetylcholine receptor inhibitor; Direct protein sequencing;
Neurotoxin; Postsynaptic neurotoxin; Toxin.
