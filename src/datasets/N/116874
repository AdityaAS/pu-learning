-!- FUNCTION: One of the proteins essential for the formation of the
    RNA polymerase antitermination complex in the presence of lambda
    phage N protein. However, it is involved in the transcription
    termination process at certain sites during normal bacterial
    growth. Binds to the boxA RNA motif.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nusB family.
