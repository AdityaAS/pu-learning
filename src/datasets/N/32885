AC   P37269; Q31LQ5;
Phytoene synthase (EC 2.5.1.-).
"Molecular cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a
cyanobacterial gene coding for phytoene synthase, a carotenoid
biosynthesis enzyme.";
"Complete sequence of chromosome 1 of Synechococcus elongatus PCC
7942.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reaction from prephytoene diphosphate to
    phytoene.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 geranylgeranyl diphosphate = diphosphate +
    prephytoene diphosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Prephytoene diphosphate = diphosphate +
    phytoene.
-!- PATHWAY: Carotenoid biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phytoene/squalene synthetase family.
