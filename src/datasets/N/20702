AC   Q10991;
Cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) [Contains: Cathepsin L heavy chain;
Cathepsin L light chain].
"The amino acid sequences, structure comparisons and inhibition
kinetics of sheep cathepsin L and sheep stefin B.";
-!- FUNCTION: Important for the overall degradation of proteins in
    lysosomes.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Specificity close to that of papain. As
    compared to cathepsin B, cathepsin L exhibits higher activity
    toward protein substrates, but has little activity on Z-Arg-Arg-
    NHMec, and no peptidyl-dipeptidase activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer of a heavy and a light chain linked by disulfide
    bonds.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Lysosome.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase C1 family.
