Dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase component of pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (EC 2.3.1.12) (E2) (Dihydrolipoamide
acetyltransferase component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex).
"Identification and analysis of the genes coding for the putative
pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex in Acholeplasma laidlawii.";
-!- FUNCTION: The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the overall
    conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO(2). It contains
    multiple copies of three enzymatic components: pyruvate
    dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and
    lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + enzyme 6-N-(dihydrolipoyl)lysine
    = CoA + enzyme 6-N-(S-acetyldihydrolipoyl)lysine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 lipoyl cofactors covalently (Potential).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a 24-polypeptide structural core with octahedral
    symmetry (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 lipoyl-binding domains.
