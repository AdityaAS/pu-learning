AC   P06290;
ATP synthase B chain (EC 3.6.3.14) (ATPase subunit I).
"The complete nucleotide sequence of the tobacco chloroplast genome:
its gene organization and expression.";
"Occurrence of silent RNA editing in chloroplasts: its species
specificity and the influence of environmental and developmental
conditions.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; single-pass membrane protein.
-!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=31.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase B chain family.
