AC   P10955;
Sensor protein fixL (EC 2.7.13.3).
"Cascade regulation of nif gene expression in Rhizobium meliloti.";
"Nucleotide sequence and predicted functions of the entire
Sinorhizobium meliloti pSymA megaplasmid.";
"The oxygen sensor FixL of Rhizobium meliloti is a membrane protein
containing four possible transmembrane segments.";
"Sensory mechanism of oxygen sensor FixL from Rhizobium meliloti:
crystallographic, mutagenesis and resonance Raman spectroscopic
studies.";
-!- FUNCTION: Putative oxygen sensor; modulates the activity of fixJ,
    a transcriptional activator of nitrogen fixation fixK gene. FixL
    probably acts as a kinase that phosphorylates fixJ.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + protein L-histidine = ADP + protein N-
    phospho-L-histidine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 heme group per subunit.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: The heme moiety regulates the kinase activity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 histidine kinase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PAC (PAS-associated C-terminal) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domain.
