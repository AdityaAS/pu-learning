AC   O35739;
Krueppel-like factor 9 (Transcription factor BTEB1) (Basic
transcription element-binding protein 1) (BTE-binding protein 1) (GC
box-binding protein 1).
"Transcriptional regulation of the AP-2alpha promoter by BTEB-1 and
AP-2rep, a novel wt-1/egr-related zinc finger repressor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transcription factor that binds to GC box promoter
    elements. Selectively activates mRNA synthesis from genes
    containing tandem repeats of GC boxes but represses genes with a
    single GC box.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Sp1 C2H2-type zinc-finger protein
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 C2H2-type zinc fingers.
