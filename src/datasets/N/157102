AC   P0ACI1; P27292;
Right origin-binding protein.
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to the right arm of the replication origin oriC of
    the chromosome. Rob binding may influence the formation of the
    nucleoprotein structure, required for oriC function in the
    initiation of replication (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HTH araC/xylS-type DNA-binding domain.
Complete proteome; DNA-binding.
