AC   Q9LX49;
Pirin 1 (AtPirin1).
"Pirin, a highly conserved protein essential for Arabidopsis
development, interacts with the MET1/DNMT1 class of DNA
methyltransferases.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 3 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"The Arabidopsis cupin domain protein AtPirin1 interacts with the G
protein alpha-subunit GPA1 and regulates seed germination and early
seedling development.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in abscisic acid signal transduction. Plays a
    role in seed germination and early seedling development.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with the G protein alpha-1 subunit GPA1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Present at similar levels in seedlings and
    mature plants.
-!- INDUCTION: Up-regulated by abscisic acid (ABA) and low-fluence red
    light, but not by low-fluence blue light.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains one cupin domain that is not required for
    interaction with the G protein alpha subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pirin family.
Abscisic acid signaling pathway; Nuclear protein.
