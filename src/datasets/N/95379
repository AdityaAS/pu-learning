flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates a global response to leucine. Exogenous leucine
    affects the expression of a number of different operons; lrp
    mediates this effect for at least some of these operons. For
    example it is regulator of the branched-chain amino acid transport
    genes (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HTH asnC-type DNA-binding domain.
