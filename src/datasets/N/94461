AC   P14856;
Seed lipoxygenase-2 (EC 1.13.11.12).
"The cDNA cloning of a pea (Pisum sativum) seed lipoxygenase. Sequence
comparisons of the two major pea seed lipoxygenase isoforms.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plant lipoxygenase may be involved in a number of
    diverse aspects of plant physiology including growth and
    development, pest resistance, and senescence or responses to
    wounding. It catalyzes the hydroperoxidation of lipids, containing
    a cis,cis-1,4-pentadiene structure.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Linoleate + O(2) = (9Z,11E)-(13S)-13-
    hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoate.
-!- COFACTOR: Iron.
-!- PATHWAY: Oxylipin biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lipoxygenase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PLAT domain.
