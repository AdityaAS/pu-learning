-!- FUNCTION: Bidirectionally degrades single-stranded DNA into large
    acid-insoluble oligonucleotides, which are then degraded further
    into small acid-soluble oligonucleotides. It can also degrade 3'
    or 5' ss regions extending from the termini of duplex DNA
    molecules and displaced ss regions.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Exonucleolytic cleavage in either 5'- to 3'-
    or 3'- to 5'-direction to yield nucleoside 5'-phosphates.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterooligomer composed of two different subunits with an
    approximate ratio of 4 small subunits for 1 large.
-!- INTERACTION:

    P45549:yhfW; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-559703, EBI-1132637;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the xseA family.
