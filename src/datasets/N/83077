Invasin.
"Identification of invasin: a protein that allows enteric bacteria to
penetrate cultured mammalian cells.";
"Insights into the evolution of Yersinia pestis through whole-genome
comparison with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.";
"Identification of the integrin binding domain of the Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis invasin protein.";
"Crystal structure of invasin: a bacterial integrin-binding protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Invasin is a protein that allows enteric bacteria to
    penetrate cultured mammalian cells. The entry of invasin in the
    cell is mediated by binding several beta-1 chain integrins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell surface.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the intimin/invasin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 Big-1 (bacterial Ig-like domain 1) domains.
-!- CAUTION: It is uncertain whether Met-1, Met-17 or Met-19 is the
    initiator.
