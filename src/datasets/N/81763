"Cross-species PCR cloning of gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus)
interleukin-2 cDNA and its expression in COS-7 cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produced by T-cells in response to antigenic or
    mitogenic stimulation, this protein is required for T-cell
    proliferation and other activities crucial to regulation of the
    immune response. Can stimulate B-cells, monocytes, lymphokine-
    activated killer cells, natural killer cells, and glioma cells.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IL-2 family.
