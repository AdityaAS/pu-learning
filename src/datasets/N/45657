AC   P68635; P21035;
Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (EC 3.6.1.23)
(dUTPase) (dUTP pyrophosphatase).
"Structural-functional organization of segment of vaccinia virus
genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: This enzyme is involved in nucleotide metabolism: it
    produces dUMP, the immediate precursor of thymidine nucleotides
    and it decreases the intracellular concentration of dUTP so that
    uracil cannot be incorporated into DNA.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: dUTP + H(2)O = dUMP + diphosphate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dUTPase family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally thought to be a protease-like protein
    (pseudoprotease).
