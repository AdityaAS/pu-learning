Ran GTPase-activating protein 2 (Ran nuclear import/export-related
protein 2) (RanGAP).
"2.2 Mb of contiguous nucleotide sequence from chromosome III of C.
elegans.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
"The GTPase Ran regulates chromosome positioning and nuclear envelope
assembly in vivo.";
-!- FUNCTION: GTPase system comprising ran-1, ran-2 and ran-3 is
    essential in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Ran-2 is a GTPase
    activator for the nuclear RAS-related regulatory protein Ran,
    converting it to the putatively inactive GDP-bound state. Required
    for correct chromosome alignment and segregation on the metaphase
    plate.
