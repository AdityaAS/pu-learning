AC   Q8DZL4;
GMP reductase (EC 1.7.1.7) (Guanosine 5'-monophosphate oxidoreductase)
(Guanosine monophosphate reductase).
"Complete genome sequence and comparative genomic analysis of an
emerging human pathogen, serotype V Streptococcus agalactiae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the irreversible NADPH-dependent deamination
    of GMP to IMP. It functions in the conversion of nucleobase,
    nucleoside and nucleotide derivatives of G to A nucleotides, and
    in maintaining the intracellular balance of A and G nucleotides
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Inosine 5'-phosphate + NH(3) + NADP(+) =
    guanosine 5'-phosphate + NADPH.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IMPDH/GMPR family. GuaC type 2
    subfamily.
