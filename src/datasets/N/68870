Guanine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.3) (Guanase) (Guanine aminase) (Guanine
aminohydrolase) (GAH).
"Cloning and characterization of human guanine deaminase. Purification
and partial amino acid sequence of the mouse protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of guanine,
    producing xanthine and ammonia.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Guanine + H(2)O = xanthine + NH(3).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Purine nucleotide catabolism.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATZ/TRZ family.
Direct protein sequencing; Hydrolase; Zinc.
