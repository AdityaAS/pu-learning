AC   Q3MHR5;
Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 2 (Splicing factor SC35) (SC-35)
(Splicing component, 35 kDa).
-!- FUNCTION: Necessary for the splicing of pre-mRNA. It is required
    for formation of the earliest ATP-dependent splicing complex and
    interacts with spliceosomal components bound to both the 5' and 3'
    splice sites during spliceosome assembly. It also is required for
    ATP-dependent interactions of both U1 and U2 snRNPs with pre-mRNA.
    Interacts with other spliceosomal components, via the RS domains,
    to form a bridge between the 5' and 3' splice site binding
    components, U1 snRNP and U2AF. Binds to purine-rich RNA sequences,
    either 5'-AGSAGAGTA-3' (S=C or G) or 5'-GTTCGAGTA-3'. Can bind to
    beta-globin mRNA and commit it to the splicing pathway (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: In vitro, binds SFRS1 (ASF/SF2), SNRP70 and U2AF1 but not
    U2AF2. Binds SFRS12. Interacts with CCNL1 and CCNL2. Interacts
    with SFRS2IP (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Extensively phosphorylated on serine residues in the RS
    domain (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the splicing factor SR family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RRM (RNA recognition motif) domain.
