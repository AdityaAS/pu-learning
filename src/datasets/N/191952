Ubiquitin ligase TRIM63 (EC 6.3.2.-) (Tripartite motif-containing
protein 63) (Muscle-specific RING finger protein 1) (MuRF1) (MURF-1)
(Muscle RING finger protein 1).
"Muscle-specific RING finger 1 is a bona fide ubiquitin ligase that
degrades cardiac troponin I.";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"Hydrogen peroxide stimulates ubiquitin-conjugating activity and
expression of genes for specific E2 and E3 proteins in skeletal muscle
myotubes.";
"Muscle ring finger protein-1 inhibits PKC-epsilon activation and
prevents cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.";
-!- FUNCTION: E3 ubiquitin ligase. Regulates proteasomal degradation
    of cardiac troponin I/TNNI3 and probably of other sarcomeric-
    associated proteins. May play a role in striated muscle atrophy
    and hypertrophy by regulating an anti-hypertrophic PKC-mediated
    signaling pathway. May regulate the organization of myofibrils
    through TTN in muscle cells.
-!- PATHWAY: Ubiquitin conjugation; third step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homooligomer and heterooligomer. Interacts with SUMO2,
    titin/TTN and GMEB1. Interacts with TRIM54 and probably with
    TRIM55 (By similarity). Interacts with TNNI3. Forms a ternary
    complex with GNB2L1 and PRKCE.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Note=Localizes to the M-
    and Z-lines in skeletal muscle (By similarity). Colocalizes with
    TNNI3 in myocytes.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q38HM4-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q38HM4-2; Sequence=VSP_016647, VSP_016648;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- INDUCTION: By hydrogen peroxide.
-!- DOMAIN: The RING-type zinc finger mediates interaction with SUMO2
    and localization to the nucleus (By similarity). Also required for
    the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 B box-type zinc finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 COS domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RING-type zinc finger.
