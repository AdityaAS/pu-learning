Adenylate cyclase type 1 (EC 4.6.1.1) (Adenylate cyclase type I) (ATP
pyrophosphate-lyase 1) (Adenylyl cyclase 1) (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-
activated adenylyl cyclase).
"The DNA sequence of human chromosome 7.";
"Cloning, chromosomal mapping, and expression of human fetal brain
type I adenylyl cyclase.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase. May be
    involved in regulatory processes in the central nervous system. It
    may play a role in memory acquisition and learning.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP = 3',5'-cyclic AMP + diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by calcium/calmodulin. Inhibited by
    the G protein beta and gamma subunit complex.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain, retina and adrenal medulla.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adenylyl cyclase class-4/guanylyl
    cyclase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 guanylate cyclase domains.
