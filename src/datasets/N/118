-!- FUNCTION: Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large
    spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathway. Binds
    to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a
    phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results
    in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Interacts with PCTK1 and SSH1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
