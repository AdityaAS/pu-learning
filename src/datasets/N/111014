-!- FUNCTION: Stimulates muscle contractions of specific regions of
    the gastrointestinal tract. In rat, NMU stimulates contractions of
    stomach circular muscle.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed throughout the gastrointestinal
    tract with highest levels in the duodenum and jejunum. Low levels
    in spinal cord, hypothalamus, and stomach.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NmU family.
