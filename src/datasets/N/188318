"Molecular analysis of resveratrol synthase. cDNA, genomic clones and
relationship with chalcone synthase.";
"Stilbene synthase gene.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3 malonyl-CoA + 4-coumaroyl-CoA = 4 CoA +
    3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene + 4 CO(2).
-!- PATHWAY: Stilbene-type phytoalexins biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- INDUCTION: By stress. Experimentally, by yeast extract and
    elicitor from P.megasperma.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chalcone/stilbene synthases family.
