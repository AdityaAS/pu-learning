-!- FUNCTION: Essential for mitochondrial replication and
    transcription. Confers selective promoter recognition on the core
    subunit of the yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Interacts with
    DNA in a non-specific manner.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 9380 molecules/cell.
