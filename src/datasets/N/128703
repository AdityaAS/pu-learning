"Complete nucleotide sequence of the genome of coxsackievirus B1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Capsid proteins VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4 form a closed
    capsid enclosing the viral positive strand RNA genome. VP4 lies on
    the inner surface of the protein shell formed by VP1, VP2 and VP3.
    All the three latter proteins contains a beta-sheet structure
    called beta-barrel jelly roll (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: P2A and P3C polypeptides are cysteine proteases that
    cleave at certain Gln-|-Gly and Tyr-|-Gly sites in the
    polyprotein.
-!- FUNCTION: It is thought that the P2C protein attaches to vesicular
    membranes and is associated with viral RNA synthesis.
-!- FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase replicates genomic and
    antigenomic RNA by recognizing replications specific signals.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Selective cleavage of Gln-|-Gly bond in the
    poliovirus polyprotein. In other picornavirus reactions Glu may be
    substituted for Gln, and Ser or Thr for Gly.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Selective cleavage of Tyr-|-Gly bond in the
    picornavirus polyprotein.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- PTM: VPg is covalently linked to the genomic RNA (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Specific enzymatic cleavages yield mature proteins. Cleavage
    between VP4 and VP2 is autocatalytic; VP1/P2A is catalyzed by P2A;
    all other cleavages are catalyzed by P3C (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Myristoylation of VP4 is required during RNA encapsidation
    and formation of the mature virus particle (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The virus capsid is composed of 60 icosahedral
    units, each of which is composed of one copy each of proteins VP1,
    VP2, VP3, and VP4.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 peptidase C3 domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RdRp catalytic domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SF3 helicase domain.
