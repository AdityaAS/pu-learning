Dihydropteroate synthase (EC 2.5.1.15) (DHPS) (Dihydropteroate
pyrophosphorylase).
"Transformational exchanges in the dihydropteroate synthase gene of
Neisseria meningitidis: a novel mechanism for acquisition of
sulfonamide resistance.";
"Sulfonamide resistance in Neisseria meningitidis as defined by site-
directed mutagenesis could have its origin in other species.";
"Complete genome sequence of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain
MC58.";
-!- FUNCTION: DHPS catalyzes the formation of the immediate precursor
    of folic acid. It is implicated in resistance to sulfonamide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-
    dihydropteridine diphosphate + 4-aminobenzoate = diphosphate +
    dihydropteroate.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis;
    tetrahydrofolate from 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-
    dihydropteridine diphosphate and 4-aminobenzoate: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DHPS family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 pterin-binding domain.
