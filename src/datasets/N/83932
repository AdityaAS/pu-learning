AC   Q99UX4;
Iron-regulated surface determinant protein A precursor (Staphylococcal
transferrin-binding protein A) (Fur-regulated protein A).
"Whole genome sequencing of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds transferrin, hemoglobin, hemin, fetuin,
    asialofetuin and protein A. Also binds fibronectin and chains B-
    beta and gamma of fibrinogen. Could play a role in the removal of
    heme from hemoglobin. The isdA-mediated iron-acquisition system
    from transferrin could play only an ancillary role in the iron
    uptake whereas the siderophore-mediated iron-acquisition system
    from transferrin seems to play an essential or dominant role (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell wall; peptidoglycan-anchor (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: Repressed by fur in the presence of iron (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The NEAT domain is responsible for binding fibrinogen (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 NEAT domain.
