AC   Q4PI89;
Transcription elongation factor SPT6 (Chromatin elongation factor
SPT6).
"Insights from the genome of the biotrophic fungal plant pathogen
Ustilago maydis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in maintenance of chromatin structure
    during RNA polymerase II transcription elongation thereby
    repressing transcription initiation from cryptic promoters.
    Mediates the reassembly of nucleosomes onto the promoters of at
    least a selected set of genes during repression; the nucleosome
    reassembly is essential for transcriptional repression (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SPT6 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SH2 domain.
Nuclear protein; SH2 domain; Transcription; Transcription regulation.
