AC   Q5LNT7;
Holliday junction ATP-dependent DNA helicase ruvA (EC 3.6.1.-).
"Genome sequence of Silicibacter pomeroyi reveals adaptations to the
marine environment.";
-!- FUNCTION: The ruvA-ruvB complex in the presence of ATP renatures
    cruciform structure in supercoiled DNA with palindromic sequence,
    indicating that it may promote strand exchange reactions in
    homologous recombination. RuvAB is an helicase that mediates the
    Holliday junction migration by localized denaturation and
    reannealing. RuvA stimulates, in the presence of DNA, the weak
    ATPase activity of ruvB (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a complex with ruvB.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ruvA family.
