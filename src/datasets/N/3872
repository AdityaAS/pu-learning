AC   P23478;
ATP-dependent nuclease subunit A (EC 3.6.1.-) (ATP-dependent helicase
addA).
"Cloning, sequencing, and expression of Bacillus subtilis genes
involved in ATP-dependent nuclease synthesis.";
"The 172 kb prkA-addAB region from 83 degrees to 97 degrees of the
Bacillus subtilis chromosome contains several dysfunctional genes, the
glyB marker, many genes encoding transporter proteins, and the
ubiquitous hit gene.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Sequencing of regions downstream of addA (98 degrees) and citG (289
degrees) in Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The enzyme complex may have a wide variety of catalytic
    activities including ATP-dependent exonuclease, ATP-stimulated
    endonuclease, ATP-dependent helicase and DNA-dependent ATPase
    activities. The subunit A may have a role in DNA unwinding
    (helicase), and in the nuclease activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The B.subtilis ATP-dependent nuclease complex is formed
    by one B subunit in conjunction with one A subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the helicase family. UvrD subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 uvrD-like helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 uvrD-like helicase C-terminal domain.
