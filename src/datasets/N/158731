AC   Q7U8K3;
DNA-directed RNA polymerase gamma chain (EC 2.7.7.6) (RNAP gamma
subunit) (Transcriptase gamma chain) (RNA polymerase gamma subunit).
"The genome of a motile marine Synechococcus.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription
    of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as
    substrates.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: In cyanobacteria the RNAP catalytic core is composed of 2
    alpha, 1 beta, 1 beta', 1 gamma and 1 omega subunit. When a sigma
    factor is associated with the core the holoenzyme is formed, which
    can initiate transcription (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA polymerase beta' chain family.
    RpoC1 subfamily.
 GO:0006351; P:transcription, DNA-dependent; IEA:HAMAP.
