AC   Q8FE75;
Isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase (EC 5.3.3.2) (IPP isomerase)
(Isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase) (IPP:DMAPP isomerase).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the 1,3-allylic rearrangement of the
    homoallylic substrate isopentenyl (IPP) to its highly
    electrophilic allylic isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Isopentenyl diphosphate = dimethylallyl
    diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit. The magnesium ion
    binds only when substrate is bound (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 manganese ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; dimethylallyl-PP biosynthesis;
    dimethylallyl-PP from isopentenyl-PP: single step [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IPP isomerase type 1 family.
