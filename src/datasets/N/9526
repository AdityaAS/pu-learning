"Comparative genomics of two Leptospira interrogans serovars reveals
novel insights into physiology and pathogenesis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes two activities which are involved in the
    cyclic version of arginine biosynthesis: the synthesis of
    acetylglutamate from glutamate and acetyl-CoA, and of ornithine by
    transacetylation between acetylornithine and glutamate (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-N-acetyl-L-ornithine + L-glutamate = L-
    ornithine + N-acetyl-L-glutamate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + L-glutamate = CoA + N-acetyl-L-
    glutamate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-arginine biosynthesis; L-
    ornithine and N-acetyl-L-glutamate from 2-N-acetyl-L-ornithine and
    L-glutamate (cyclic): single step.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-arginine biosynthesis; 2-N-
    acetyl-L-ornithine from L-glutamate: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer of two alpha and two beta chains (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Some bacteria possess a monofunctional argJ, i.e.,
    capable of catalyzing only the fifth step of the arginine
    biosynthetic pathway.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the argJ family.
