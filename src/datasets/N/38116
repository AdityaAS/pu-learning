D-alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.21) (D-aspartate
aminotransferase) (D-amino acid aminotransferase) (D-amino acid
transaminase) (DAAT).
"Nucleotide sequence of the Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 10716 dat gene
and comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence with those of
other bacterial species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts on the D-isomers of alanine, leucine, aspartate,
    glutamate, aminobutyrate, norvaline and asparagine. The enzyme
    transfers an amino group from a substrate D-amino acid to the
    pyridoxal phosphate cofactor to form pyridoxamine and an alpha-
    keto acid in the first half-reaction. The second half-reaction is
    the reverse of the first, transferring the amino group from the
    pyridoxamine to a second alpha-keto acid to form the product D-
    amino acid via a ping-pong mechanism. This is an important process
    in the formation of D-alanine and D-glutamate, which are essential
    bacterial cell wall components (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-alanine + 2-oxoglutarate = pyruvate + D-
    glutamate.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-IV pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
    aminotransferase family.
