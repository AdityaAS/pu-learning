AC   Q9XWW1;
Probable signal peptidase complex subunit 2 (EC 3.4.-.-) (Microsomal
signal peptidase 25 kDa subunit) (SPase 25 kDa subunit).
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Microsomal signal peptidase is a membrane-bound
    endoproteinase that removes signal peptides from nascent proteins
    as they are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic
    reticulum (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex of five different proteins: SEC11L1, SEC11L3,
    SPCS1, SPCS2 and SPCS3 (By similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q18516:T07C4.1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-330241, EBI-313698;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SPCS2 family.
