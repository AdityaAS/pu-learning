AC   P30356;
Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) (MK-886-binding
protein) (Fragment).
"Cross-species comparison of 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to be required for the activation of 5-LO (5-
    lipoxygenase). Could play an essential role in the transfer of
    arachidonic acid to 5-LO. Binds to MK-886, a compound that blocks
    the biosynthesis of leukotrienes.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MAPEG family.
Leukotriene biosynthesis; Membrane; Transmembrane.
