AC   Q18217;
NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 regulatory subunit (Ubiquitin-like
activation protein 1).
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
"The NED-8 conjugating system in Caenorhabditis elegans is required
for embryogenesis and terminal differentiation of the hypodermis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Regulatory subunit of the dimeric uba-3-ula-1 E1 enzyme.
    E1 activates NEDD8 by first adenylating its C-terminal glycine
    residue with ATP, thereafter linking this residue to the side
    chain of the catalytic cysteine, yielding a NEDD8-Uba-3 thioester
    and free AMP. E1 finally transfers NEDD8 to the catalytic cysteine
    of ubc-12.
-!- PATHWAY: NEDD8 conjugation; first step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of uba-3 and ula-1. The complex binds NEDD8
    and ubc-12 (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inactivation of ula-1 results in the formation of
    an everted vulva in the L4 stage, with the subsequent rupture of
    the animal during the L4-to-adult molt.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ubiquitin-activating E1 family. ULA1
    subfamily.
Complete proteome; Ligase; Ubl conjugation pathway.
