-!- FUNCTION: DNA gyrase negatively supercoils closed circular double-
    stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent manner and also catalyzes the
    interconversion of other topological isomers of double-stranded
    DNA rings, including catenanes and knotted rings (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP-dependent breakage, passage and rejoining
    of double-stranded DNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Made up of two chains. The A chain is responsible for DNA
    breakage and rejoining; the B chain catalyzes ATP hydrolysis. The
    enzyme forms an A2B2 tetramer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type II topoisomerase family.
