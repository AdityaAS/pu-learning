GTP-binding protein REM 1 (Rad and Gem-like GTP-binding protein 1)
(GTPase-regulating endothelial cell sprouting).
"Cloning of the human Rem gene.";
"Ges, a human GTPase of the Rad/Gem/Kir family, promotes endothelial
cell sprouting and cytoskeleton reorganization.";
"The DNA sequence and comparative analysis of human chromosome 20.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Promotes endothelial cell sprouting and actin
    cytoskeletal reorganization. May be involved in angiogenesis. May
    function in Ca(2+) signaling.
-!- SUBUNIT: In vitro, interacts with calmodulin in a calcium-
    dependent manner.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Most highly expressed in the endothelial
    lining of the blood vessels in uterus and heart. Lower levels
    found in spleen, lymph node, kidney and testis. Also found in
    cells with secretory function such as the islets of Langerhans,
    lobule/duct epithelium in the breast, bile duct epithelium in the
    liver, surface epithelium in the endometrial glands of the uterus,
    colon mucosa and acinar cells in the pancreas and the prostate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small GTPase superfamily. RGK family.
Calmodulin-binding; GTP-binding; Nucleotide-binding.
