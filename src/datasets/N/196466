AC   Q4K3M0;
Probable chorismate--pyruvate lyase (EC 4.1.3.-) (CL) (CPL).
"Complete genome sequence of the plant commensal Pseudomonas
fluorescens Pf-5.";
-!- FUNCTION: Removes the pyruvyl group from chorismate, with
    concomitant aromatization of the ring, to provide 4-
    hydroxybenzoate (4HB) for the ubiquinone pathway (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Chorismate = 4-hydroxybenzoate + pyruvate.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; ubiquinone biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ubiC family.
