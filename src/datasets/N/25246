Chemotaxis response regulator protein-glutamate methylesterase
(EC 3.1.1.61).
"Multiple forms of the CheB methylesterase in bacterial
chemosensing.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Active site of the enzyme which demethylates receptors during
bacterial chemotaxis.";
"Phosphorylation of three proteins in the signaling pathway of
bacterial chemotaxis.";
"Activation of methylesterase CheB: evidence of a dual role for the
regulatory domain.";

methylesterase, CheB.";

phosphorylation-activated domain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for removing the methyl group from the
    gamma-glutamyl methyl ester residues in the methyl-accepting
    chemotaxis proteins (MCP). The MCP methylation state of the cell
    is crucial for sensory responses and adaptations.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein L-glutamate 5-O-methyl ester + H(2)O =
    protein L-glutamate + methanol.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal domain interferes with esterase activity
    and is not essential for catalysis.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by cheA.
-!- PTM: Two forms were isolated, the intact protein and a proteolytic
    fragment (146-349) that is 15-fold more active than its precursor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 cheB-type methylesterase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 response regulatory domain.
