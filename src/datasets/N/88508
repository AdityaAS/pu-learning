Kinesin-like protein 2.
"pkl1(+)and klp2(+): two kinesins of the Kar3 subfamily in fission
yeast perform different functions in both mitosis and meiosis.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"The kinesin Klp2 mediates polarization of interphase microtubules in
fission yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Microtubule-dependent motor that is involved in
    microtubule organization in the mitotic spindle. Required for the
    polarization of interphase microtubules where it orients the
    microtubule plus ends toward the cell ends and the minus ends
    toward the cell center. Mediates minus end-directed sliding of
    cytoplasmic microtubules relative to each other, thereby promoting
    mitotic spindle disassembly.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Note=During interphase.
    When in the nucleus, it associates with chromatin.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the kinesin-like protein family. NCD
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 kinesin-motor domain.
