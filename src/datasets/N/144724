Disease resistance protein RGA2 (RGA2-blb) (Blight resistance protein
RPI).
"Gene RB cloned from Solanum bulbocastanum confers broad spectrum
resistance to potato late blight.";
"An ancient R gene from the wild potato species Solanum bulbocastanum
confers broad-spectrum resistance to Phytophthora infestans in
cultivated potato and tomato.";
-!- FUNCTION: Disease resistance protein. Resistance proteins guard
    the plant against pathogens that contain an appropriate avirulence
    protein via a direct or indirect interaction with this avirulence
    protein. That triggers a defense system which restricts the
    pathogen growth. Confers a broad resistance to all known races of
    P.infestans.
-!- INDUCTION: Constitutively expressed.
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Can be introduced into cultivated potato
    (S.tuberosum) or tomato (L.esculentum) to transfer a broad-
    spectrum late blight resistance to cultivated Solanaceae from
    sexually incompatible host species.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Belongs to a four-gene family located at the same
    locus. Although the four genes are expressed in the resistant
    haplotype, only RGA2 confers the resistance to P.infestans. In the
    susceptible haplotype, RGA1 and RGA3 are likely to be pseudogenes
    created by deletions and mutations, while RGA2 contains also
    several modifications.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the disease resistance NB-LRR family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 14 LRR (leucine-rich) repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 NB-ARC domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (AAP45164 and AAP45188) sequences differ from that
    shown due to erroneous gene model prediction.
