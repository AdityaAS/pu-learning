AMSH-like protease (EC 3.1.2.15) (AMSH-LP) (STAM-binding protein-like
1) (AMSH family protein) (AMSH-FP).
"A newly identified AMSH-family protein is specifically expressed in
haploid stages of testicular germ cells.";
"Cloning of a gene for the mouse AMSH-like-protein.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: May function as a ubiquitin-protein or polyubiquitin
    hydrolase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Ubiquitin C-terminal thioester + H(2)O =
    ubiquitin + a thiol.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
