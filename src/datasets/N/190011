AC   P10154;
Lymphotoxin-alpha precursor (LT-alpha) (TNF-beta) (Tumor necrosis
factor ligand superfamily member 1).
"Structural analysis of the rabbit TNF locus, containing the genes
encoding TNF-beta (lymphotoxin) and TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis
factor).";
"Cloning and structural analysis of genes coding for tumor necrosis
factor and lymphotoxin in rabbits.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytokine that in its homotrimeric form binds to
    TNFRSF1A/TNFR1, TNFRSF1B/TNFBR and TNFRSF14/HVEM. In its
    heterotrimeric form with LTB binds to TNFRSF3/LTBR. Lymphotoxin is
    produced by lymphocytes and cytotoxic for a wide range of tumor
    cells in vitro and in vivo.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer, and heterotrimer of either two LTB and one
    LTA subunits or (less prevalent) two LTA and one LTB subunits (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Homotrimer: Secreted protein (By
    similarity). Heterotrimer: Membrane (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tumor necrosis factor family.
