AC   Q9CE80;
Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.12) (Aspartate--tRNA ligase)
(AspRS).
"The complete genome sequence of the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus
lactis ssp. lactis IL1403.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-aspartate + tRNA(Asp) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-aspartyl-tRNA(Asp).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
