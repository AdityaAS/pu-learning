AC   Q6FRV2;
Glutathione reductase (EC 1.8.1.7) (GR) (GRase).
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Maintains high levels of reduced glutathione in the
    cytosol (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 glutathione + NADP(+) = glutathione
    disulfide + NADPH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The active site is a redox-active disulfide bond
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I pyridine nucleotide-disulfide
    oxidoreductase family.
