AC   Q7TSH2;
Phosphorylase b kinase regulatory subunit beta (Phosphorylase kinase
subunit beta).
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Phosphorylase b kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of
    serine in certain substrates, including troponin I. The beta chain
    acts as a regulatory unit and modulates the activity of the
    holoenzyme in response to phosphorylation (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: By phosphorylation of various serine residues
    (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Glycogen metabolism.
-!- SUBUNIT: Polymer of 16 chains, four each of alpha, beta, gamma,
    and delta. Alpha and beta are regulatory chains, gamma is the
    catalytic chain, and delta is calmodulin (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; cytoplasmic
    side (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphorylase b kinase regulatory chain
    family.
