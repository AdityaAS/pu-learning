-!- FUNCTION: Sequence-specific RNA-binding protein which participates
    in the control of pre-mRNA splicing (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Found in a pre-mRNA exonic splicing enhancer (ESE)
    complex with SFRS10, SNRP70, SNRPA1 and SRRM1. Binds to A3
    enhancer proteins SFRS4, SFRS5, SFRS6 and SFRS9. Interacts with
    CPSF6, RNPS1, SAFB/SAFB1 and phosphorylated FUSIP1 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=P62996-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=P62996-2; Sequence=VSP_011509, VSP_011510;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Highly expressed in uterus
    and brain.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by reoxygenation following hypoxia and by
    exposure to silica. Repressed by interferon gamma, LPS and TPA.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated in the RS domains (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the splicing factor SR family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RRM (RNA recognition motif) domain.
