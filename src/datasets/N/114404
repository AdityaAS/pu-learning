AC   Q40531;
Mitogen-activated protein kinase homolog NTF6 (EC 2.7.11.24) (P43).
"Molecular cloning, functional expression in Escherichia coli, and
characterization of multiple mitogen-activated-protein kinases from
tobacco.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by tyrosine and threonine
    phosphorylation (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Very low autophosphorylation, although dramatically increased
    when Mn(2+) is added to the reaction instead of Mg(2+).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. MAP
    kinase subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
ATP-binding; Kinase; Nucleotide-binding; Phosphorylation;
