-!- FUNCTION: Converts trimethyllysine (TML) into
    hydroxytrimethyllysine (HTML).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine + 2-
    oxoglutarate + O(2) = 3-hydroxy-6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine +
    succinate + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Iron.
-!- COFACTOR: Ascorbate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amine and polyamine biosynthesis; carnitine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gamma-BBH/TMLD family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (CAD11356) sequence differs from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (EAA31955) sequence differs from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
