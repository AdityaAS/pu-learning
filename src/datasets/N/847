"Genomic sequence of a Lyme disease spirochaete, Borrelia
burgdorferi.";
-!- FUNCTION: Hydrolysis of 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-
    phosphogluconate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 6-phospho-D-glucono-1,5-lactone + H(2)O = 6-
    phospho-D-gluconate.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; pentose phosphate pathway; D-
    ribulose 5-phosphate from D-glucose 6-phosphate (oxidative stage):
    step 2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glucosamine/galactosamine-6-phosphate
    isomerase family. 6-phosphogluconolactonase subfamily.
