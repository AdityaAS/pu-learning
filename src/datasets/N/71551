Chaperone protein hchA (Hsp31).
"Whole genome sequencing of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Uses temperature-induced exposure of structured
    hydrophobic domains to capture and stabilize early unfolding
    protein intermediates under severe thermal stress. It rapidly
    releases them once stress has abated (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pfpI family. HchA subfamily.
