Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family B member 1 (Pleckstrin
homology domain retinal protein 1) (PH domain-containing protein in
retina 1) (PHRET1).
"PHR1 encodes an abundant, pleckstrin homology domain-containing
integral membrane protein in the photoreceptor outer segments.";
"KPL1, which encodes a novel PH domain-containing protein, is induced
during ciliated cell differentiation of rat tracheal epithelial
cells.";
