AC   Q9KGJ6;
Bifunctional protein glmU [Includes: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.23) (N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate
uridyltransferase); Glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase
(EC 2.3.1.157)].
"Complete genome sequence of the alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus
halodurans and genomic sequence comparison with Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the last two sequential reactions in the de
    novo biosynthetic pathway for UDP-GlcNAc. Responsible for the
    acetylation of Glc-N-1-P to give GlcNAc-1-P and for the uridyl
    transfer from UTP to GlcNAc-1-P which produces UDP-GlcNAc (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate =
    CoA + N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UTP + N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate
    = diphosphate + UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Peptidoglycan biosynthesis; lipopolysaccharide
    biosynthesis (lipid A biosynthesis); UDP-N-acetylglucosamine from
    fructose-6-P: step 3.
-!- PATHWAY: Peptidoglycan biosynthesis; lipopolysaccharide
    biosynthesis (lipid A biosynthesis); UDP-N-acetylglucosamine from
    fructose-6-P: step 4.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the N-
    acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the transferase
    hexapeptide repeat family.
