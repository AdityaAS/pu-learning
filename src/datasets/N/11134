AC   P54517;
3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.10) (3-dehydroquinase) (Type II
DHQase).
"Systematic sequencing of the 283 kb 210 degrees-232 degrees region of
the Bacillus subtilis genome containing the skin element and many
sporulation genes.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Crystal structure of the type II dehydroquinase from Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3-dehydroquinate = 3-dehydroshikimate + H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; chorismate
    biosynthesis; chorismate from D-erythrose 4-phosphate and PEP:
    step 3.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Aromatic amino acids biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homododecamer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type-II 3-dehydroquinase family.
-!- CAUTION: Phe-23 is present instead of the conserved Tyr which is
    expected to be an active site residue.
