Caltractin ICL1B (Centrin).
"Characterization of centrin genes in Paramecium.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a fundamental role in microtubule-organizing
    center structure and function. Component of the infraciliary
    lattice (ICL) and the ciliary basal bodies.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm; cytoskeleton. Note=ICL, innermost
    fibrous network of the cortical cytoskeleton.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Binds two moles of calcium per mole of protein (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the centrin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 EF-hand domains.
