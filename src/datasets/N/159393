AC   Q39T73;
DNA-directed RNA polymerase omega chain (EC 2.7.7.6) (RNAP omega
subunit) (Transcriptase omega chain) (RNA polymerase omega subunit).
"Complete sequence of Geobacter metallireducens GS-15.";
-!- FUNCTION: Promotes RNA polymerase assembly. Latches the N- and C-
    terminal regions of the beta' subunit thereby facilitating its
    interaction with the beta and alpha subunits (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: The RNAP catalytic core consists of 2 alpha, 1 beta, 1
    beta' and 1 omega subunit. When a sigma factor is associated with
    the core the holoenzyme is formed, which can initiate
    transcription (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA polymerase omega chain family.
Complete proteome; DNA-directed RNA polymerase;
Nucleotidyltransferase; Transcription; Transferase.
