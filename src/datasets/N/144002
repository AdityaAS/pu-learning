Protein Rev (Regulator of expression of viral proteins).
"Sequence of simian immunodeficiency virus from African green monkey,
a new member of the HIV/SIV group.";
-!- FUNCTION: Escorts unspliced or incompletely spliced viral pre-
    mRNAs (late transcripts) out of the nucleus of infected cells.
    These pre-mRNAs carry a recognition sequence called Rev responsive
    element (RRE) located in the env gene, that is not present in
    fully spliced viral mRNAs (early transcripts). This function is
    essential since most viral proteins are translated from unspliced
    or partially spliced pre-mRNAs which cannot exit the nucleus by
    the pathway used by fully processed cellular mRNAs (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homomultimer; when bound to the RRE. Multimeric assembly
    is essential for activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nucleolus. Cytoplasm. Note=The
    presence of both nuclear import and nuclear export signals leads
    to continuous shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The RNA-binding motif binds to the RRE, a stem-and-loop
    structure present in incompletely spliced viral pre-mRNAs. This
    region also contains the NLS which mediates nuclear localization.
    These overlapping functions prevent Rev bound to RRE from
    undesirable return to the nucleus. When Rev binds the RRE, the NLS
    becomes masked while the NES remains accessible (By similarity).
