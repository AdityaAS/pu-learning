AC   Q59331; O65981;
Acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1) (Acetokinase).
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the activation of acetate to acetyl CoA and
    the secretion of acetate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + acetate = ADP + acetyl phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + propanoate = ADP + propanoyl phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; acetyl-CoA
    biosynthesis; acetyl-CoA from acetate: step 1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acetokinase family.
