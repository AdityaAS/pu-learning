AC   Q8FNZ7;
1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5-[(5-phosphoribosylamino)methylideneamino]
imidazole-4-carboxamide isomerase (EC 5.3.1.16)
(Phosphoribosylformimino-5-aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide
isomerase).
"Comparative complete genome sequence analysis of the amino acid
replacements responsible for the thermostability of Corynebacterium
efficiens.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5-((5-
    phosphoribosylamino)methylideneamino)imidazole-4-carboxamide = 5-
    ((5-phospho-1-deoxyribulos-1-ylamino)methylideneamino)-1-(5-
    phosphoribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-histidine biosynthesis; L-
    histidine from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate: step 4.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hisA/hisF family.
-!- CAUTION: Ala-129 is present instead of the conserved Asp which is
    expected to be an active site residue.
