-!- FUNCTION: Acetylates 'Lys-11' and 'Lys-16' of histone H2B; 'Lys-
    9', 'Lys-14', 'Lys-18', 'Lys-23' and 'Lys-27' of histone H3; 'Lys-
    8' and 'Lys-16' of histone H4 with a lower preference, and
    contributes to HTZ1 acetylation. Acetylation of histones gives a
    specific tag for epigenetic transcription activation. Operates in
    concert with certain DNA-binding transcriptional activators such
    as GCN4 or HAP2/3/4. Its acetylteransferase activity seems to be
    dependent on the association in different multisubunit complexes.
    Functions as histone acetyltransferase component of the
    transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complexes SAGA,
    SALSA and ADA. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent
    transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At
    the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal
    transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II
    transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP
    interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity,
    interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and
    TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation
    (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal
    histone H3 to some extent at 'Lys-9', 'Lys-14', 'Lys-18' and 'Lys-
    23'. SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences
    (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in
    positive transcriptional regulation. The ADA histone
    acetyltransferase complex, preferentially acetylates nucleosomal
    histones H3 (at 'Lys-14' and 'Lys-18') and H2B, leading to
    transcription regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly
    overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates
    methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10
    locus.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + histone = CoA + acetylhistone.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the 1.8 MDa SAGA complex, which consists of
    at least of TRA1, CHD1, SPT7, TAF5, ADA3, SGF73, SPT20/ADA5, SPT8,
    TAF12, TAF6, HFI1/ADA1, UBP8, GCN5, ADA2, SPT3, SGF29, TAF10,
    TAF9, SGF11 and SUS1. TAF5, TAF6, TAF9, TAF19, TAF12 and ADA1 seem
    to be present in 2 copies. SAGA is built of 5 distinct domains
    with specialized functions. Domain I (containing TRA1) probably
    represents the activator interaction surface. Domain II
    (containing TAF5 and TAF6, and probably TAF9 and TAF10), domain
    III (containing GCN5, TAF10, SPT7, TAF5 and ADA1, and probably
    ADA2, ADA3 and TAF12), and domain IV (containing HFI1/ADA1 and
    TAF6, and probably TAF9) are believed to play primarily an
    architectural role. Domain III also harbors the HAT activity.
    Domain V (containing SPT3 and SPT20, and probably SPT8) represents
    the TBP-interacting module, which may be associated transiently
    with SAGA. SUS1 associates with the SAC3-THP1 complex. Component
    of the SALSA complex, which consists of at least TRA1, SPT7 (C-
    terminal truncated form), TAF5, ADA3, SPT20, TAF12, TAF6, HFI1,
    GCN5, ADA2 and SPT3. Component of the SLIK complex, which of at
    least TRA1, CHD1, SPT7, TAF5, ADA3, SPT20, RTG2, TAF12, TAF6,
    HFI1, UBP8, GCN5, ADA2, SPT3, SGF29, TAF10 and TAF9. Component of
    the ADA/GCN5 complex, that consists of HFI1/ADA1, ADA2, ADA3,
    SPT20/ADA5 and GCN5 and is probably a subcomplex of SAGA.
    Component of the 0.8 MDa ADA complex, which at least consists of
    ADA2, ADA3, AHC1 and GCN5. GCN5 interacts with ADA2.
