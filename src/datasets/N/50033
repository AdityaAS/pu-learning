AC   Q5AAG1;
Enhancer of polycomb-like protein 1.
"The diploid genome sequence of Candida albicans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex
    which is involved in transcriptional activation of selected genes
    principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 and H2A. The
    NuA4 complex is also involved in DNA repair. Involved in gene
    silencing by neighboring heterochromatin, blockage of the
    silencing spreading along the chromosome, and required for cell
    cycle progression through G2/M (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the enhancer of polycomb family.
