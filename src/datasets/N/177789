-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in protein trafficking from the plasma
    membrane to the early endosome (EE) as well as in homotypic fusion
    of endocytic organelles. Mediates the endocytic trafficking from
    early endosomes to late endosomes and lysosomes.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a SNARE complex with VTI1B, STX8 and VAMP8 which
    functions in the homotypic fusion of late endosomes. Interacts
    with VPS33A. Found in a complex with VAMP8 and VTI1B in the liver.
    Part of the SNARE core complex containing VAMP8, STX8 and VTI1B
    (By similarity). Interacts with VPS11, VPS16 and VPS18.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endosome; early endosome; early endosomal
    membrane; single-pass type IV membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=O15400-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O15400-2; Sequence=VSP_012938;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highest expression is found in placenta
    followed by heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and brain. Low
    expression is found in pancreas, lung and liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the syntaxin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 t-SNARE coiled-coil homology domain.
