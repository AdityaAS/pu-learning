Asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGPR 1) (ASGP-R 1) (Hepatic lectin 1)
(RHL-1).
"Rat liver asialoglycoprotein receptor lacks a cleavable NH2-terminal
signal sequence.";
"Characterization of the gene encoding the major rat liver
asialoglycoprotein receptor.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";

asialoglycoprotein receptor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the endocytosis of plasma glycoproteins to
    which the terminal sialic acid residue on their complex
    carbohydrate moieties has been removed. The receptor recognizes
    terminal galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine units. After ligand
    binding to the receptor, the resulting complex is internalized and
    transported to a sorting organelle, where receptor and ligand are
    disassociated. The receptor then returns to the cell membrane
    surface.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with LASS2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed exclusively in hepatic parenchymal
    cells.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on a cytoplasmic Ser residue (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Calcium is required for ligand binding.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Two types of rat hepatic lectin have been
    identified, RHL-1 and RHL-2/3, having a relative abundance of 4:1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 C-type lectin domain.
