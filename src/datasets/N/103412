MurNAc-pentapeptide phosphotransferase).
"The genome of the natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens
C58.";
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen and biotechnology agent
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.";
-!- FUNCTION: First step of the lipid cycle reactions in the
    biosynthesis of the cell wall peptidoglycan (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-Mur2Ac(oyl-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-
    D-Ala) + undecaprenyl phosphate = UMP + Mur2Ac(oyl-L-Ala-gamma-D-
    Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala)-diphosphoundecaprenol.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycan biosynthesis; peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 4 family. MraY
    subfamily.
