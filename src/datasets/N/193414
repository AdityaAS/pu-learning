AC   P20575;
Anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.18).
"Evolutionary differences in chromosomal locations of four early genes
of the tryptophan pathway in fluorescent pseudomonads: DNA sequences
and characterization of Pseudomonas putida trpE and trpGDC.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: N-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)-anthranilate +
    diphosphate = anthranilate + 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-
    diphosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-tryptophan biosynthesis; L-
    tryptophan from chorismate: step 2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase
    family.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis;
Glycosyltransferase; Transferase; Tryptophan biosynthesis.
