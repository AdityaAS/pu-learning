AC   Q6L1C2;
50S ribosomal protein L22P.
"Genome sequence of Picrophilus torridus and its implications for life
around pH 0.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein binds specifically to 23S rRNA. It makes
    multiple contacts with different domains of the 23S rRNA in the
    assembled 50S subunit and ribosome (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: The globular domain of the protein is located near the
    polypeptide exit tunnel on the outside of the subunit, while an
    extended beta-hairpin is found that lines the wall of the exit
    tunnel in the center of the 70S ribosome (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L22P family.
