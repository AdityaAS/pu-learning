AC   P52147;
Arsenate reductase (EC 1.20.4.1) (Arsenical pump modifier).
"The arsenical resistance operon of IncN plasmid R46.";
-!- FUNCTION: Reduction of arsenate [As(V)] to arsenite [As(III)].
    This protein expands the substrate specificity of arsAB pump which
    can extrude arsenite and antimonite to allow for arsenate pumping
    and resistance.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Arsenate + glutaredoxin = arsenite +
    glutaredoxin disulfide.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the arsC family.
Arsenical resistance; Oxidoreductase; Plasmid.
