    exogenous and endogenous hydrophobic electrophiles. This GST has a
    high catalytic activity for aflatoxin B1-8,9 epoxide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: RX + glutathione = HX + R-S-glutathione.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=25271.4; MW_ERR=2; METHOD=Electrospray;
    RANGE=1-220; NOTE=Ref.4.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GST superfamily. Alpha family.
Acetylation; Direct protein sequencing; Transferase.
