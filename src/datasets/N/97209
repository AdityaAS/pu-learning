AC   Q9ZDF6;
Probable NADP-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) (NADP-ME).
"The genome sequence of Rickettsia prowazekii and the origin of
mitochondria.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (S)-malate + NADP(+) = pyruvate + CO(2) +
    NADPH.
-!- COFACTOR: Divalent metal cations. Prefers magnesium or manganese
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the malic
    enzymes family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the phosphate
    acetyltransferase and butyryltransferase family.
