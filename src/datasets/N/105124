AC   P55300;
F420-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase
(EC 1.5.99.9) (MTD) (Coenzyme F420-dependent N5,N10-
methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase).
"Cloning, sequencing, and transcriptional analysis of the coenzyme
F420-dependent methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase
gene from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum strain Marburg and
functional expression in Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reversible reduction of methenyl-
    H(4)MPT(+) to methylene-H(4)MPT.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin +
    coenzyme F420 = 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin + reduced
    coenzyme F420.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Oxygen-stable, strictly dependent on coenzyme
    F420, thermostable, thermophilic and exhibits maximum activity at
    pH 4 and 55-65 degrees Celsius.
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis from carbon dioxide; fourth step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Found to be tightly associated with methyl-coenzyme M
    methylreductase.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MTD family.
