AC   Q8NYY3;
Histidine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.3) (Histidase).
"Genome and virulence determinants of high virulence community-
acquired MRSA.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-histidine = urocanate + NH(3).
-!- PATHWAY: Histidine degradation; first step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- PTM: Contains an active site 4-methylidene-imidazol-5-one (MIO),
    which is formed autocatalytically by cyclization and dehydration
    of residues Ala-Ser-Gly (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PAL/histidase family.
Complete proteome; Histidine metabolism; Lyase.
