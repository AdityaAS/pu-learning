-!- FUNCTION: Nuclease that resolves Holliday junction intermediates
    in genetic recombination. Cleaves the cruciform structure in
    supercoiled DNA by nicking to strands with the same polarity at
    sites symmetrically opposed at the junction in the homologous arms
    and leaves a 5'-terminal phosphate and a 3'-terminal hydroxyl
    group.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage at a junction such as
    a reciprocal single-stranded crossover between two homologous DNA
    duplexes (Holliday junction).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0A6F5:groL; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1123014, EBI-543750;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ruvC family.
