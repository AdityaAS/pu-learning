-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + H(2)O + oxaloacetate = citrate +
    CoA.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Weakly inhibited by ATP (apparent Ki = 10 mm).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate metabolism; tricarboxylic acid cycle.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homohexamer (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Citrate synthase is found in nearly all cells
    capable of oxidative metabolism.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the citrate synthase family.
Allosteric enzyme; Complete proteome; Transferase;
Tricarboxylic acid cycle.
