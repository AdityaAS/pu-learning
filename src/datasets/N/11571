Arsenite methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.137) (S-adenosyl-L-
methionine:arsenic(III) methyltransferase) (Methylarsonite
methyltransferase).
"Identification of novel hematopoietic stem cell regulatory genes.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to
    trivalent arsenicals producing methylated and dimethylated
    arsenicals. It methylates arsenite to form methylarsonate, Me-
    AsO(3)H(2), which is reduced by methylarsonate reductase to
    methylarsonite, Me-As(OH)2. Methylarsonite is also a substrate and
    it is converted into the much less toxic compound dimethylarsinate
    (cacodylate), Me(2)As(O)-OH (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + arsenite = S-
    adenosyl-L-homocysteine + methylarsonate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + methylarsonite = S-
    adenosyl-L-homocysteine + dimethylarsinate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily.
