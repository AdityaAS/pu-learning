AC   Q6G9K4;
DNA topoisomerase 4 subunit A (EC 5.99.1.-) (Topoisomerase IV subunit
A).
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: Topoisomerase IV is essential for chromosome
    segregation. It has relaxation of supercoiled DNA activity.
    Performs the decatenation events required during the replication
    of a circular DNA molecule (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of two subunits: parC and parE.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the topoisomerase gyrA/parC subunit family.
Complete proteome; DNA-binding; Isomerase; Topoisomerase.
