-!- FUNCTION: Transfers and isomerizes the ribose moiety from AdoMet
    to the 7-aminomethyl group of 7-deazaguanine (preQ1-tRNA) to give
    epoxyqueuosine (oQ-tRNA).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosylmethionine + 7-aminomethyl-7-
    deazaguanosine = methionine + adenine + epoxyqueuosine.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine,
    adenosylornithine and products.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=98 uM for S-adenosylmethionine;
      KM=1.9 uM for 7-(aminomethyl)-7-deazaguanosine;
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleoside biosynthesis; queuosine biosynthesis;
    qeuosine-tRNA from GTP; step 4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This reaction follows a completely ordered
    sequential bi-ter kinetic mechanism, with binding of preQ1-tRNATyr
    followed by AdoMet to form the ternary complex. Products are then
    released in the following order: adenine, methionine, and oQ-
    tRNATyr.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the queA family.
