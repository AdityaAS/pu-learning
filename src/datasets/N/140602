Ras-interacting protein 1 (Rain).
"Identification and characterization of Rain, a novel Ras-interacting
protein with a unique subcellular localization.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: May act as effector for Golgi-bound HRAS and other Ras-
    like proteins. May promote HRAS-mediated transformation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with Ras family members that have been
    activated by GTP binding. Interacts with HRAS, RAP1A, RAP2, RRAS,
    RAF1 and RRAS2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm; perinuclear region. Golgi
    apparatus; Golgi stack. Note=Associated with perinuclear vesicles.
    Is recruited to Golgi stacks by activated HRAS.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in heart. Detected at lower
    levels in placenta and pancreas.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 dilute domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ras-associating domain.
Golgi apparatus; Membrane.
