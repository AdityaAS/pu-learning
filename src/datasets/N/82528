-!- FUNCTION: Functions in nuclear protein import, either in
    association with an adapter protein, like an importin-alpha
    subunit, which binds to nuclear localization signals (NLS) in
    cargo substrates, or by acting as autonomous nuclear transport
    receptor. Acting autonomously, serves itself as NLS receptor.
    Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore
    complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1 through binding to nucleoporin
    FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through
    the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism. At the
    nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to importin-beta and the
    three components separate and importin-alpha and -beta are re-
    exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis
    releases Ran from importin. The directionality of nuclear import
    is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the
    GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus.
    Mediates autonomously the nuclear import of ribosomal proteins
    RPL23A, RPS7 and RPL5. Binds to a beta-like import receptor
    binding (BIB) domain of RPL23A. In association with IPO7 mediates
    the nuclear import of H1 histone. In vitro, mediates nuclear
    import of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones. In case of HIV-1
    infection, binds and mediates the nuclear import of HIV-1 Rev.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a complex with an importin alpha subunit. Forms an
    heterodimer with IPO7. Interacts with IPO7, SNUPN, RPL23A and
    XPO1. The KPNB1/IPO7 heterodimer interacts with H1 histone.
    Interacts with H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones (By similarity).

    SMN1 and ZNF259. Component of a nuclear export receptor complex
