AC   P54663;
Sensor protein degS (EC 2.7.13.3).
"Cloning and sequencing the degS-degU operon from an alkalophilic
Bacillus brevis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in a sensory transduction pathway that affect
    the production of enzymes that degrade polymeric carbon and
    nitrogen sources. DegS probably acts as a kinase that
    phosphorylates degU.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + protein L-histidine = ADP + protein N-
    phospho-L-histidine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 histidine kinase domain.
Kinase; Phosphorylation; Transferase; Two-component regulatory system.
