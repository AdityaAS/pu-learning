"Exploiting secondary growth in Arabidopsis. Construction of xylem and
bark cDNA libraries and cloning of three xylem endopeptidases.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
"The Arabidopsis xylem peptidase XCP1 is a tracheary element vacuolar
protein that may be a papain ortholog.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable thiol protease (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole (By similarity). Cell membrane (By
    similarity). Note=Predominantly vacuolar. May be associated to
    plasma membrane (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Mostly expressed in roots, stems and flowers.
    Confined to tracheary elements, and specifically to xylem.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase C1 family.
