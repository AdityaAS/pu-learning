Segregation and condensation protein B.
"Whole genome comparisons of serotype 4b and 1/2a strains of the food-
borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes reveal new insights into the
core genome components of this species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Participates to chromosomal partition during cell
    division. May act via the formation of a condensin-like complex
    containing smc and scpA that pull DNA away from mid-cell into both
    cell halves (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Homodimerization may be required to stabilize
    the binding of scpA to the smc head domains. Component of a
    cohesin-like complex composed of scpA, scpB and the smc homodimer,
    in which scpA and scpB bind to the head domain of smc. The
    presence of the three proteins is required for the association of
    the complex with DNA (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Note=Associated
    with two foci at the outer edges of the nucleoid region in young
    cells, and at four foci within both cell halves in older cells (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the scpB family.
