Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase ATX4 (EC 2.1.1.43) (Trithorax-
homolog protein 4) (TRX-homolog protein 4) (Trithorax 4) (Protein SET
DOMAIN GROUP 16).
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 4 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains at least 29 active genes
encoding SET domain proteins that can be assigned to four
evolutionarily conserved classes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Histone methyltransferase (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + histone L-lysine =
    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + histone 6-N-methyl-L-lysine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TRX/MLL family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 post-SET domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PWWP domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SET domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequences differ from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
