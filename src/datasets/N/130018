AC   Q2UGK2;
Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B precursor (EC 5.2.1.8) (PPIase
B) (Rotamase B).
"Genome sequencing and analysis of Aspergillus oryzae.";
-!- FUNCTION: PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes
    the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in
    oligopeptides (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Peptidylproline (omega=180) = peptidylproline
    (omega=0).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA) (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    lumen (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyclophilin-type PPIase family. PPIase
    B subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PPIase cyclophilin-type domain.
