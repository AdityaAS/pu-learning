AC   Q7CNQ9;
Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8) (HGPRT)
(HGPRTase).
"Genome sequence and comparative microarray analysis of serotype M18
group A Streptococcus strains associated with acute rheumatic fever
outbreaks.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: IMP + diphosphate = hypoxanthine + 5-phospho-
    alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: GMP + diphosphate = guanine + 5-phospho-alpha-
    D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per subunit. One of the ions does
    not make direct protein contacts (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Purine salvage.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the purine/pyrimidine
    phosphoribosyltransferase family.
Complete proteome; Glycosyltransferase; Magnesium; Metal-binding;
