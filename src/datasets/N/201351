AC   Q40078;
Vacuolar ATP synthase subunit B isoform 1 (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-ATPase B
subunit 1) (Vacuolar proton pump B subunit 1).
"Two cDNA clones encoding isoforms of the B subunit of the vacuolar
ATPase from barley roots.";
-!- FUNCTION: Non-catalytic subunit of the peripheral V1 complex of
    vacuolar ATPase. V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying a variety
    of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (main components: subunits A, B,
    C, D, E, and F) attached to an integral membrane V0 proton pore
    complex (main component: the proteolipid protein).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
ATP synthesis; Hydrogen ion transport; Hydrolase; Ion transport;
Transport.
