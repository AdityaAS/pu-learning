AC   Q9ZM48;
Homoserine kinase (EC 2.7.1.39) (HSK) (HK).
"Genomic sequence comparison of two unrelated isolates of the human
gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-homoserine = ADP + O-phospho-L-
    homoserine.

    threonine from L-aspartate: step 4.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GHMP kinase family. Homoserine kinase
    subfamily.
