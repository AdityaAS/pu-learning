AC   Q36097;
Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (EC 1.9.3.1) (Cytochrome c oxidase
polypeptide I).
"A 7.1 kb linear DNA molecule of Theileria parva has scrambled rDNA
sequences and open reading frames for mitochondrially-encoded
proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory
    chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Subunits 1-
    3 form the functional core of the enzyme complex. CO I is the
    catalytic subunit of the enzyme. Electrons originating in
    cytochrome c are transferred via the copper A center of subunit 2
    and heme A of subunit 1 to the bimetallic center formed by heme A3
    and copper B (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Respiratory chain; terminal step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the heme-copper respiratory oxidase family.
