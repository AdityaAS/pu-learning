-!- FUNCTION: Plays a central role both in proteosomal degradation of
    misfolded proteins and DNA repair. Central component of a complex
    required to couple deglycosylation and proteasome-mediated
    degradation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulun
    that are retrotranslocated in the cytosol. Involved in DNA
    excision repair. May play a part in DNA damage recognition and/or
    in altering chromatin structure to allow access by damage-
    processing enzymes.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts directly with PNG1.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P25347:YCR001W; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-14668, EBI-21836;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Cytoplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 10900 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 UBA domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ubiquitin-like domain.
