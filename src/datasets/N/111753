AC   P00460;
Nitrogenase iron protein (EC 1.18.6.1) (Nitrogenase component II)
(Nitrogenase Fe protein) (Nitrogenase reductase).
"Nucleotide sequence of the R.meliloti nitrogenase reductase (nifH)
gene.";
"Nucleotide sequence and predicted functions of the entire
Sinorhizobium meliloti pSymA megaplasmid.";
"Directed transposon Tn5 mutagenesis and complementation analysis of
Rhizobium meliloti symbiotic nitrogen fixation genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: The key enzymatic reactions in nitrogen fixation are
    catalyzed by the nitrogenase complex, which has 2 components: the
    iron protein and the molybdenum-iron protein.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 8 reduced ferredoxin + 8 H(+) + N(2) + 16 ATP
    + 16 H(2)O = 8 oxidized ferredoxin + H(2) + 2 NH(3) + 16 ADP + 16
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster per dimer.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nifH/bchL/chlL family.
