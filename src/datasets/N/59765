AC   Q97FQ7;
Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit A 1 (EC 6.3.5.-) (Glu-ADT
subunit A 1).
"Genome sequence and comparative analysis of the solvent-producing
bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Furnishes a means for formation of correctly charged
    Gln-tRNA(Gln) through the transamidation of misacylated Glu-
    tRNA(Gln) in organisms which lack glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase. The
    reaction takes place in the presence of glutamine and ATP through
    an activated gamma-phospho-Glu-tRNA(Gln) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) + L-glutamine = ADP
    + phosphate + L-glutaminyl-tRNA(Gln) + L-glutamate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimer of A, B and C subunits (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the amidase family.
