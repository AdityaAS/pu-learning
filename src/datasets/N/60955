AC   Q9HNL6;
Putative O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.57)
(Glycoprotease).
"Genome sequence of Halobacterium species NRC-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Could be a metalloprotease.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of O-sialoglycoproteins; cleaves
    31-Arg-|-Asp-32 bond in glycophorin A. Does not cleave
    unglycosylated proteins, desialylated glycoproteins or
    glycoproteins that are only N-glycosylated.
-!- COFACTOR: Zinc (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M22 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
