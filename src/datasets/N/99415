AC   Q95LG8;
Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP-2 protein) (MeCP2).
"Excessive hand-wringing in a MPTP-treated monkey.";
-!- FUNCTION: Chromosomal protein that binds to methylated DNA. It can
    bind specifically to a single methyl-CpG pair. It is not
    influenced by sequences flanking the methyl-CpGs. Mediates
    transcriptional repression through interaction with histone
    deacetylase and the corepressor SIN3A.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with FNBP3 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity). Note=Colocalized
    with methyl-CpG in the genome (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 A.T hook DNA-binding domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 MBD (methyl-CpG-binding) domain.
