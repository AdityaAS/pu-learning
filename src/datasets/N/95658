Latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 2 precursor
(LTBP-2).
"8-cysteine TGF-BP structural motifs are the site of covalent binding
between mouse LTBP-3, LTBP-2, and latent TGF-beta 1.";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"Latent transforming growth factor-beta binding proteins (LTBPs) --
structural extracellular matrix proteins for targeting TGF-beta
action.";
"The latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein (LTBP)
family.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play an integral structural role in elastic-fiber
    architectural organization and/or assembly. May be involved in the
    assembly, secretion and targeting of TGF- beta to sites at which
    it is stored and/or activated. May play critical roles in
    controlling and directing the activity of TGF-beta. May have a
    structural role in the extra cellular matrix (ECM).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms part of the large latent transforming growth factor
    beta precursor complex; removal is essential for activation of
    complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
    Note=Localized in nuchal ligament and aorta to the fibrillin-
    containing, microfibrillar component of elastic fibers (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Associates covalently with small latent TGF-beta complex
    via Repeat B and Repeat C.
-!- PTM: Contains hydroxylated asparagine residues (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the LTBP family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 20 EGF-like domains.
EGF-like domain; Glycoprotein; Growth factor binding; Hydroxylation;
Repeat; Signal.
