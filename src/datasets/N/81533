AC   P54349;
Interleukin-12 subunit alpha precursor (IL-12A) (IL-12 subunit p35)
(Cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor 35 kDa subunit) (CLMF p35).
"Enzymatic amplification and molecular cloning of cDNA encoding the
small and large subunits of bovine interleukin 12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytokine that can act as a growth factor for activated T
    and NK cells, enhance the lytic activity of NK/lymphokine-
    activated Killer cells, and stimulate the production of IFN-gamma
    by resting PBMC (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer with IL12B; disulfide-linked. The heterodimer
    is known as interleukin IL-12.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IL-6 superfamily.
