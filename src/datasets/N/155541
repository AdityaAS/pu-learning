AC   Q9WUX6;
Ribonuclease pancreatic precursor (EC 3.1.27.5) (RNase 1) (RNase A).
"The phylogenetic position of 'Acomyinae' (Rodentia, Mammalia) as
sister group of a Murinae + Gerbillinae clade: evidence from the
nuclear ribonuclease gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Endonuclease that catalyzes the cleavage of RNA on the
    3' side of pyrimidine nucleotides. Acts on single stranded and
    double stranded RNA (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage to nucleoside 3'-
    phosphates and 3'-phosphooligonucleotides ending in Cp or Up with
    2',3'-cyclic phosphate intermediates.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Pancreas.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pancreatic ribonuclease family.
