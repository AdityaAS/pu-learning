AC   P02636;
Sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein, alpha-B and -A chains (SCP alpha
chain).
"Amino acid sequence of alpha chain of sarcoplasmic calcium binding
protein obtained from shrimp tail muscle.";
-!- FUNCTION: Like parvalbumins, SCP's seem to be more abundant in
    fast contracting muscles, but no functional relationship can be
    established from this distribution.
-!- SUBUNIT: SCPs from crayfish, lobster, and shrimp are polymorphic
    dimers; three isotypes (alpha-alpha, alpha-beta, and beta-beta)
    have been identified.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The sarcoplasmic calcium-binding proteins are
    abundant in the muscle of arthropods, molluscs, annelids, and
    protochordates.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein has three functional calcium-binding
    sites; potential site 4 has lost affinity for calcium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 EF-hand domains.
Acetylation; Calcium; Direct protein sequencing; Muscle protein;
Repeat.
