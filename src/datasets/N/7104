AC   Q865U8;
Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (Cardiac ankyrin repeat
protein).
"Left-right asymmetric ventricular expression of CARP in the piglet
heart: regional response to experimental heart failure.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play an important role in endothelial cell
    activation. May act as a nuclear transcription factor that
    negatively regulates the expression of cardiac genes (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with TTN/titin and YBX1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in heart. In postnatal neonatal
    heart, it is expressed in an assymetrical way; left ventricule
    favored towards right ventricule. Whether or not, this could be
    correlated with an hypertrophic heart is still a matter of debate.
    Levels increase gradually from newborn to adult.
-!- INDUCTION: Down-regulated by doxorubicin (adriamycin), in vitro.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 ANK repeats.
ANK repeat; Coiled coil; Nuclear protein; Repeat.
