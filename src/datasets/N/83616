AC   Q9JVG3;
Inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1) (Pyrophosphate phospho-
hydrolase) (PPase).
"Complete DNA sequence of a serogroup A strain of Neisseria
meningitidis Z2491.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Diphosphate + H(2)O = 2 phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 4 magnesium ions per subunit. Other metal ions can
    support activity, but at a lower rate. Two magnesium ions are
    required for the activation of the enzyme and are present before
    substrate binds, two additional magnesium ions form complexes with
    substrate and product (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PPase family.
Complete proteome; Hydrolase; Magnesium; Metal-binding.
