AC   Q73FE1;
33 kDa chaperonin (Heat shock protein 33 homolog) (HSP33).
"The genome sequence of Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987 reveals metabolic
adaptations and a large plasmid related to Bacillus anthracis pXO1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Redox regulated molecular chaperone. Protects both
    thermally unfolding and oxidatively damaged proteins from
    irreversible aggregation. Plays an important role in the bacterial
    defense system toward oxidative stress (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Under oxidizing conditions two disulfide bonds are formed
    involving the reactive cysteines. Under reducing conditions zinc
    is bound to the reactive cysteines and the protein is inactive (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HSP33 family.
