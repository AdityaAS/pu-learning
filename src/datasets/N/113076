AC   O61309;
Nitric-oxide synthase (EC 1.14.13.39) (NOS type I) (Neuronal NOS) (N-
NOS) (nNOS).
"Molecular characterization of NOS in a mollusc: expression in a giant
modulatory neuron.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces nitric oxide (NO) which is a messenger molecule
    with diverse functions throughout the body (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-arginine + n NADPH + m O(2) = citrulline +
    nitric oxide + n NADP(+).
-!- COFACTOR: Heme group (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FMN (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Stimulated by calcium/calmodulin.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Long;
      IsoId=O61309-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Short;
      IsoId=O61309-2; Sequence=VSP_003584;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the central nervous system, in
    the serotonergic cerebral giant cells. The isoform Long and
    isoform Short are expressed equally in the CNS.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NOS family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 flavodoxin-like domain.
