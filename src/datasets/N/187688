AC   Q723Y9;
Thiamine-phosphate pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.5.1.3) (TMP
pyrophosphorylase) (TMP-PPase) (Thiamine-phosphate synthase).
"Whole genome comparisons of serotype 4b and 1/2a strains of the food-
borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes reveal new insights into the
core genome components of this species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Condenses 4-methyl-5-(beta-hydroxyethyl)thiazole
    monophosphate (THZ-P) and 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl pyrimidine
    pyrophosphate (HMP-PP) to form thiamine monophosphate (TMP) (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine
    diphosphate + 4-methyl-5-(2-phosphono-oxyethyl)thiazole =
    diphosphate + thiamine monophosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; thiamine pyrophosphate
    biosynthesis; thiamine pyrophosphate from 4-amino-2-methyl-5-
    diphosphomethylpyrimidine and 4-methyl-5-(2-phosphoethyl)-
    thiazole: step 1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TMP-PPase family.
