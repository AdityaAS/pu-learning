Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM13.
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mitochondrial intermembrane chaperone that participates
    in the import and insertion of some multi-pass transmembrane
    proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Also required for
    the transfer of beta-barrel precursors from the TOM complex to the
    sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer
    membrane. Acts as a chaperone-like protein that protects the
    hydrophobic precursors from aggregation and guide them through the
    mitochondrial intermembrane space. The TIM8-TIM13 complex is non
    essential and only mediates the import of few proteins, while the
    predominant TIM9-TIM10 70 kDa complex is crucial and mediates the
    import of much more proteins (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterohexamer; composed of 3 copies of TIM8 and 3 copies
    of TIM13, named soluble 70 kDa complex. Associates with the TIM22
    complex, whose core is composed of TIM22 and TIM54. Interacts with
    the transmembrane regions of multi-pass transmembrane proteins in
    transit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    peripheral membrane protein; intermembrane side (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The twin CX3C motif contains 4 conserved Cys residues that
    form 2 disulfide bonds in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
    However, during the transit of TIM13 from cytoplasm into
    mitochondrion, the Cys residues probably coordinate zinc, thereby
    preventing folding and allowing its transfer across mitochondrial
    outer membrane (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small Tim family.
