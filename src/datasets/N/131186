AC   Q9Z0T3;
Major prion protein precursor (PrP) (CD230 antigen).
"Analysis of 27 mammalian and 9 avian PrPs reveals high conservation
of flexible regions of the prion protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: The function of PrP is not known. PrP is encoded in the
    host genome and is expressed both in normal and infected cells.
-!- SUBUNIT: PrP has a tendency to aggregate yielding polymers called
    "rods".
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; GPI-anchor.
-!- DISEASE: Found in high quantity in the brain of humans and animals
    infected with degenerative neurological diseases such as kuru,
    Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome
    (GSS), scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),
    transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), etc.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prion family.
