AC   Q71WB9;
Elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu).
"Whole genome comparisons of serotype 4b and 1/2a strains of the food-
borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes reveal new insights into the
core genome components of this species.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein promotes the GTP-dependent binding of
    aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of ribosomes during protein
    biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GTP-binding elongation factor family.
    EF-Tu/EF-1A subfamily.
