Fructoselysine kinase (EC 2.7.1.-).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Phosphorylates fructoselysine to yield fructoselysine 6-
    phosphate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + fructoselysine = ADP + fructoselysine 6-
    phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Fructoselysine utilization; first step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the carbohydrate kinase pfkB family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (AAG58481) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a stop codon at position 111 which was translated as Trp to extend
    the sequence.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (AAG58482) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a stop codon at position 111 which was translated as Trp to extend
    the sequence.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (BAB37647) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a stop codon at position 111 which was translated as Trp to extend
    the sequence.
