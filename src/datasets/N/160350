AC   P24353;
Plastid 30S ribosomal protein S8.
"Genes for ribosomal proteins are retained on the 73 kb DNA from
Astasia longa that resembles Euglena chloroplast DNA.";
"Plastid ribosomal protein genes from the nonphotosynthetic flagellate
Astasia longa.";
"Complete gene map of the plastid genome of the nonphotosynthetic
euglenoid flagellate Astasia longa.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly to 16S rRNA central domain where it helps coordinate
    assembly of the platform of the 30S subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S8P family.
