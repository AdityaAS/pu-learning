"Mutations in the gene encoding pejvakin, a newly identified protein
of the afferent auditory pathway, cause DFNB59 auditory neuropathy.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential in the activity of auditory pathway neurons.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PJVK are the cause of deafness autosomal
    recessive 59 (DFNB59) [MIM:610220]. DFNB59 is characterized by
    hearing impairment in which neural transmission of the auditory
    signal is impaired, while cochlear outer hair cells remain
    functional.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: 'Pejvakin' means 'echo' in Persian.
