AC   Q3JMR4;
50S ribosomal protein L4.
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, this protein
    initially binds near the 5' end of the 23S rRNA. It is important
    during the early stages of 50S assembly. It makes multiple
    contacts with different domains of the 23S rRNA in the assembled
    50S subunit and ribosome (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: Forms part of the polypeptide exit tunnel (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L4P family.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
