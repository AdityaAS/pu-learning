-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: An aromatic amino acid + 2-oxoglutarate = an
    aromatic oxo acid + L-glutamate.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-phenylalanine biosynthesis; L-
    phenylalanine from phenylpyruvate (ArAT route): single step [final
    step].
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-tyrosine biosynthesis; L-
    tyrosine from prephenate: step 2 [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P0A6F5:groL; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1114498, EBI-543750;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
    aminotransferase family.
