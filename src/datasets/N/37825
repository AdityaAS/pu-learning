AC   P73410;
Cysteine synthase (EC 2.5.1.47) (O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase) (O-
acetylserine (Thiol)-lyase) (CSase).
"Sequence analysis of the genome of the unicellular cyanobacterium
Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. II. Sequence determination of the
entire genome and assignment of potential protein-coding regions.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3-O-acetyl-L-serine + H(2)S = L-cysteine +
    acetate.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-cysteine biosynthesis; L-
    cysteine from L-serine: step 2 [final step].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cysteine synthase/cystathionine beta-
    synthase family.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Complete proteome; Cysteine biosynthesis;
