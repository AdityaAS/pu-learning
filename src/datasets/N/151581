"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
"Comparative genomics of bacterial zinc regulons: enhanced ion
transport, pathogenesis, and rearrangement of ribosomal proteins.";
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: May be induced under zinc-limiting conditions; in that
    case may be repressed by the zinc uptake regulation protein zur.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L31P family. Type B
    subfamily.
