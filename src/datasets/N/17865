AC   Q4WDD7;
Ubiquitin-protein ligase bre1 (EC 6.3.2.-).
"Genomic sequence of the pathogenic and allergenic filamentous fungus
Aspergillus fumigatus.";
-!- FUNCTION: E3 ubiquitin ligase protein that mediates
    monoubiquitination of 'Lys-123' of histone H2B. H2B 'Lys-123'
    ubiquitination gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional
    activation and is also prerequisite for histone H3 'Lys-4' and
    'Lys-79' methylation (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Ubiquitin conjugation; third step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the BRE1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RING-type zinc finger.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
