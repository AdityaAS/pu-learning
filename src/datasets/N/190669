AC   Q6LS21;
Chaperone protein torD.
"Life at depth: Photobacterium profundum genome sequence and
expression analysis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the biogenesis of torA. Acts on torA before
    the insertion of the molybdenum cofactor and, as a result,
    probably favors a conformation of the apoenzyme that is competent
    for acquiring the cofactor (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the torD/dmsD family. TorD subfamily.
