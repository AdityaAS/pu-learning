AC   P26378; Q96J74;
ELAV-like protein 4 (Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis antigen HuD)
(Hu-antigen D).
"HuD, a paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis antigen, contains RNA-binding
domains and is homologous to Elav and Sex-lethal.";
"Novel products of the HuD, HuC, NNP-1 and alpha-internexin genes
identified by autologous antibody screening of a pediatric
neuroblastoma library.";
"The DNA sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1.";
"CARM1 regulates proliferation of PC12 cells by methylating HuD.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play a role in neuron-specific RNA processing.
    Protects CDKN1A mRNA from decay by binding to its 3'-UTR (By
    similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
    Name=1; Synonyms=HUD1PRO;
      IsoId=P26378-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2; Synonyms=HUD1;
      IsoId=P26378-2; Sequence=VSP_005791;
    Name=3; Synonyms=HUD4;
      IsoId=P26378-3; Sequence=VSP_014150, VSP_005791;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain.
-!- PTM: Methylation at Arg-243 by CARM1 weakens protective binding to
    the 3'-UTR of CDKN1A mRNA and down-regulates CDKN1A protein
    expression, thereby maintaining cells in a proliferative state.
    Methylation is inhibited by NGF, which facilitates neurite
    outgrowth (By similarity).
-!- DISEASE: Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis sensory neuropathy is
    associated with small cell lung cancer and is characterized by
    dementia, sensory loss, and other neurological disabilities. It
    may result from an immune response primarily directed against a
    small cell lung tumor antigen which is misdirected against similar
    antigens expressed in brain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNP elav family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 RRM (RNA recognition motif) domains.
