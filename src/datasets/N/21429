AC   Q8FJ50;
Curved DNA-binding protein.
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-binding protein that preferentially recognizes a
    curved DNA sequence. It is probably a functional analog of dnaJ;
    displays overlapping activities with dnaJ, but functions under
    different conditions, probably acting as a molecular chaperone in
    an adaptive response to environmental stresses other than heat
    shock. Lacks autonomous chaperone activity; binds native
    substrates and targets them for recognition by dnaK. Its activity
    is inhibited by the binding of cbpM (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm; nucleoid (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 J domain.
