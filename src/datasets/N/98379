AC   Q9MZV8;
Melanocortin receptor 5 (MC5-R) (Fragment).
"The porcine melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5R) gene: polymorphisms,
linkage and physical mapping.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for MSH (alpha, beta and gamma) and ACTH. The
    activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate
    adenylate cyclase. This receptor is a possible mediator of the
    immunomodulation properties of melanocortins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
