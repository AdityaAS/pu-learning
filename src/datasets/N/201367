AC   Q19626;
Probable vacuolar ATP synthase subunit B (EC 3.6.3.14) (V-ATPase B
subunit) (Vacuolar proton pump B subunit).
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Non-catalytic subunit of the peripheral V1 complex of
    vacuolar ATPase. V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying a variety
    of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: V-ATPase is an heteromultimeric enzyme composed of a
    peripheral catalytic V1 complex (main components: subunits A, B,
    C, D, E, and F) attached to an integral membrane V0 proton pore
    complex (main component: the proteolipid protein) (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
