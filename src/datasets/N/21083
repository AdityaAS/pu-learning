AC   Q58917;
Probable cobalt-precorrin-6Y C(5,15)-methyltransferase
[decarboxylating] (EC 2.1.1.-) (Cobalt-precorrin-6 methyltransferase)
(Cobalt-precorrin-6Y methylase).
"Complete genome sequence of the methanogenic archaeon, Methanococcus
jannaschii.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably catalyzes the methylation of C-5 in cobalt-
    precorrin-6Y to form cobalt-precorrin-7W-a (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 1 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cobalt-precorrin-
    6Y = 1 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + cobalt-precorrin-7W-a + CO(2).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis;
    cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide from sirohydrochlorin (anaerobic
    route): step 7.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the precorrin methyltransferase family.
Cobalamin biosynthesis; Complete proteome; Methyltransferase;
