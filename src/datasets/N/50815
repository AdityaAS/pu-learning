AC   P81429;
Esterase SG1 precursor (EC 3.1.1.1) (Carboxylic-ester hydrolase)
(Fragment).
"Amplification and methylation of an esterase gene associated with
insecticide-resistance in greenbugs, Schizaphis graminum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Overproduction of nonspecific esterases is a common
    mechanism of resistance to organophosphate insecticides.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A carboxylic ester + H(2)O = an alcohol + a
    carboxylate.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This esterase confers organophosphate insecticide
    resistance.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type-B carboxylesterase/lipase family.
