AC   P01734;
T-cell receptor beta chain V region 3H.25 precursor.
"Rearranged beta T cell receptor genes in a helper T cell clone
specific for lysozyme: no correlation between V beta and MHC
restriction.";
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This T-cell clone expresses only a single V-beta
    chain segment although it has three rearrangements in the beta
    chain family.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This rearranged V-beta chain segment, specific for
    chicken egg-white lysozyme and I-A(b), is the same as that
    expressed in a T-helper cell specific for cytochrome C and an I-
    E(k) MHC molecule.
