AC   P60934; Q97SC8;
Undecaprenyl-diphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.27) (Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate
phosphatase) (Bacitracin resistance protein).
"Complete genome sequence of a virulent isolate of Streptococcus
pneumoniae.";
"The bacA gene, which determines bacitracin susceptibility in
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, is also required
for virulence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the dephosphorylation of undecaprenyl
    diphosphate (UPP) (By similarity). Confers resistance to
    bacitracin. Is also required for virulence.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Undecaprenyl diphosphate + H(2)O =
    undecaprenyl phosphate + phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Bacitracin is thought to be involved in the
    inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis by sequestering undecaprenyl
    diphosphate, thereby reducing the pool of lipid carrier available.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the uppP family.
