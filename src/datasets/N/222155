AC   P41653;
Protein ycf2.
"Loss of all ndh genes as determined by sequencing the entire
chloroplast genome of the black pine Pinus thunbergii.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable ATPase of unknown function. Its presence in a
    non-photosynthetic plant (Epifagus virginiana) and experiments in
    tobacco indicate that it has an essential function which is
    probably not related to photosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast stroma (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ycf2 family.
