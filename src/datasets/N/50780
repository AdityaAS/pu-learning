AC   Q6GK27;
Protein essA precursor.
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for secretion of esxA (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This strain lacks esaC and esxB. EsaC is probably
    involved in the establishment of infection in the host; esxB is an
    exoprotein that may interact with esxA and it is important for the
    virulence of some S.aureus strains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the essA family.
