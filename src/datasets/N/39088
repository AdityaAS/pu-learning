ATP-dependent RNA helicase dbp2 (EC 3.6.1.-) (p68-like protein).
"p68 RNA helicase: identification of a nucleolar form and cloning of
related genes containing a conserved intron in yeasts.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: ATP-dependent RNA helicase involved nonsense-mediated
    mRNA decay and ribosome biogenesis through rRNA processing (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Associates with polysomes (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The Q motif is unique to and characteristic of the DEAD
    box family of RNA helicases and controls ATP binding and
    hydrolysis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DEAD box helicase family. DDX5/DBP2
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase C-terminal domain.
