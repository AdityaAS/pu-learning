AC   O15355;
Protein phosphatase 2C isoform gamma (EC 3.1.3.16) (PP2C-gamma)
(Protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1 gamma) (Protein phosphatase
1C).
"PP2C gamma: a human protein phosphatase with a unique acidic
domain.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A phosphoprotein + H(2)O = a protein +
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium or manganese ions per subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Most abundant in testis,
    skeletal muscle, and heart.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PP2C family.
