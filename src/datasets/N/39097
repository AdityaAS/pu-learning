AC   Q5KHB7; Q55SY3;
ATP-dependent RNA helicase DBP3 (EC 3.6.1.-).
"The genome of the basidiomycetous yeast and human pathogen
Cryptococcus neoformans.";
-!- FUNCTION: ATP-dependent RNA helicase required for 60S ribosomal
    subunit synthesis. Involved in efficient pre-rRNA processing,
    predominantly at site A3, which is necessary for the normal
    formation of 25S and 5.8S rRNAs (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nucleolus (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The Q motif is unique to and characteristic of the DEAD
    box family of RNA helicases and controls ATP binding and
    hydrolysis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DEAD box helicase family. DDX5/DBP2
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase C-terminal domain.
