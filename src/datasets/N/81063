Intermediate filament protein ifb-1 (Intermediate filament protein B1)
(IF-B1) (Cel IF B1).
"Eight genes and alternative RNA processing pathways generate an
unexpectedly large diversity of cytoplasmic intermediate filament
proteins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
"Essential roles for four cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins
in Caenorhabditis elegans development.";
"In vivo and in vitro evidence that the four essential intermediate
filament (IF) proteins A1, A2, A3 and B1 of the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans form an obligate heteropolymeric IF system.";
"Intermediate filaments are required for C. elegans epidermal
elongation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytoplasmic intermediate filaments provide mechanical
    strength to cells. Essential protein, involved in attachment
    structures in epidermal cells that connect muscles to the external
    cuticle. Required in morphogenesis and epidermal integrity.
    Probable component of embryonic epidermal attachment structures.
    Functions in larval muscle attachment independently of ifa-2.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms some heteropolymeric filaments with ifa-1, ifa-2,
    ifa-3 and probably ifa-4.

    Name=b; Synonyms=B1a IFB-1A;
      IsoId=Q19289-2; Sequence=VSP_010147;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in epidermal cells. Expressed in
    amphid sensory neurons, the excretory cells, the vulva, the
    uterus, the rectum and some neurons of the tail. Isoform a and
    isoform b display a similar pattern of expression. Isoform a is
    predominant in pharyngeal tonofilaments.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the intermediate filament family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
