Period circadian protein (Fragment).
"Interspecific and intraspecific comparisons of the period locus in
the Drosophila willistoni sibling species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential for biological clock functions. Determines the
    period length of circadian and ultradian rhythms; an increase in
    PER dosage leads to shortened circadian rhythms and a decrease
    leads to lengthened circadian rhythms. Essential for the circadian
    rhythmicity of locomotor activity, eclosion behavior, and for the
    rhythmic component of the male courtship song that originates in
    the thoracic nervous system. The biological cycle depends on the
    rhythmic formation and nuclear localization of the TIM-PER
    complex. Light induces the degradation of TIM, which promotes
    elimination of PER. Nuclear activity of the heterodimer
    coordinatively regulates PER and TIM transcription through a
    negative feedback loop. Behaves as a negative element in circadian
    transcriptional loop. Does not appear to bind DNA, suggesting
    indirect transcriptional inhibition (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms heterodimer with timeless (TIM); the complex then
    translocates into the nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity). Cytoplasm;
    perinuclear region (By similarity). Note=Nuclear at specific
    periods of the day. First accumulates in the perinuclear region
    about one hour before translocation into the nucleus. Interaction
    with Tim is required for nuclear localization (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated with a circadian rhythmicity, probably by the
    double-time protein (dbt). Phosphorylation could be implicated in
    the stability of per monomer and in the formation of heterodimer
    per-tim (By similarity).
