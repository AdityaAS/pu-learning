AC   P22861; Q92336;
Glucoamylase 1 precursor (EC 3.2.1.3) (Glucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase)
(1,4-alpha-D-glucan glucohydrolase).
"Cloning of the Schwanniomyces occidentalis glucoamylase gene (GAM1)
and its expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"Striking structural and functional similarities suggest that
intestinal sucrase-isomaltase, human lysosomal alpha-glucosidase and
Schwanniomyces occidentalis glucoamylase are derived from a common
ancestral gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: This glucoamylase has a specificity toward both alpha-
    1,4 and alpha-1,6 linkages.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of terminal 1,4-linked alpha-D-
    glucose residues successively from non-reducing ends of the chains
    with release of beta-D-glucose.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 31 family.
