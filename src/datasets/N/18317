-!- FUNCTION: Serine/threonine-protein kinase component of the BUR
    kinase complex involved in transcription regulation. This complex
    phosphorylates 'Ser-120' of the UBC2/RAD6 ubiquitin-conjugating
    enzyme (E2), leading to monoubiquitination of histone H2B, the
    localization of the PAF1 complex to the chromatin, and the
    silencing of telomeric-associated genes. Also required for histone
    H3 'Lys-4' trimethylation. May phosphorylate the 'Ser-5' of the
    RBP1 carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) repeats. Necessary for the
    recovery from pheromone-induced growth arrest in the cell cycle G1
    phase. The kinase activity of the complex requires the presence of
    BUR2.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + [DNA-directed RNA polymerase] = ADP +
    [DNA-directed RNA polymerase] phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Belongs to the BUR kinase complex composed of SGV1/BUR1
    and BUR2. Interacts with BUR2 and RBP1.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q05949:BUR2; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-17078, EBI-30948;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 2070 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
    CDC2/CDKX subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
