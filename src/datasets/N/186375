AC   Q9YH85;
Alpha-tectorin precursor.
"Chick alpha-tectorin: molecular cloning and expression during
embryogenesis.";
"The mouse tectorins. Modular matrix proteins of the inner ear
homologous to components of the sperm-egg adhesion system.";
"The protein composition of the avian tectorial membrane.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the major non-collagenous components of the
    tectorial membrane. The tectorial membrane is an extracellular
    matrix of the inner ear that covers the neuroepithelium of the
    cochlea and contacts the stereocilia bundles of specialized
    sensory hair cells. Sound induces movement of these hair cells
    relative to the tectorial membrane, deflects the stereocilia and
    leads to fluctuations in hair-cell membrane potential, transducing
    sound into electrical signals.
-!- SUBUNIT: May form homomeric filament after self-association or
    heteromeric filament after association with beta-tectorin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; GPI-anchor;
    extracellular side (Probable). Note=Found in the non-collagenous
    matrix of the tectorial membrane (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the inner ear.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Apically located within the epithelium of the
    developing basilar papilla at days E5.5 to E8. As development
    proceeds, expression becomes restricted to the basal layer. In the
    utricle, alpha-tectorin is first expressed at E4.5.
-!- DOMAIN: Zona pellucida domain may enable to form filaments.
-!- PTM: At least 3 products of tectorin seem to exist: HMM, MMM and
    LMM. They may be generated by active processing or the result of
    proteolysis occurring between intrachain disulfide bonds.
-!- PTM: The presence of a hydrophobic C-terminus preceded by a
    potential cleavage site strongly suggests that tectorins are
    synthesized as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked, membrane-bound
    precursors. Tectorins are targeted to the apical surface of the
    inner ear epithelia by the lipid and proteolytically released into
    the extracellular compartment.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 NIDO domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 TIL (trypsin inhibitory-like) domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 VWFC domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 VWFD domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ZP domain.
