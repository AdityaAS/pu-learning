AC   Q7S7N3;
Histone acetyltransferase type B subunit 2 (EC 2.3.1.48).
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the histone acetylase B (HAT-B) complex.
    The complex acetylates 'Lys-12' of histone H4 which is required
    for telomeric silencing (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + histone = CoA + acetylhistone.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the HAT-B complex composed of at least hat-1
    and hat-2. The HAT-B complex binds to histone H4 tail (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the WD repeat RBAP46/RBAP48/MSI1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 WD repeats.
