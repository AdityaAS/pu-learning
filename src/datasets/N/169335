AC   P20606;
GTP-binding protein SAR1.
"A novel GTP-binding protein, Sar1p, is involved in transport from the
endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XVI.";
"Mutational analysis of the Sar1 protein, a small GTPase which is
essential for vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum.";
"Distinct roles for the cytoplasmic tail sequences of Emp24p and
Erv25p in transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi
complex.";
"Structure of the Sec23/24-Sar1 pre-budding complex of the COPII
vesicle coat.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the COPII coat, that covers ER-derived
    vesicles involved in transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to
    the Golgi apparatus. COPII is composed of at least five proteins:
    the SEC23/24 complex, the SEC13/31 complex, and the protein SAR1.
    SAR1 GTP-hydrolysis is a necessary step in the uncoating of
    vesicles. Essential for cell growth. May cooperate with SEC12.
-!- SUBUNIT: COPII is composed of at least five proteins: the SEC23/24
    complex, the SEC13/31 complex and SAR1. Interacts with EMP24.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Endoplasmic reticulum;
    endoplasmic reticulum membrane; peripheral membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small GTPase superfamily. SAR1 family.
