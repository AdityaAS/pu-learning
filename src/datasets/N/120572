AC   Q9PU97;
Phospholipase A2, beta bungarotoxin A7 chain precursor (EC 3.1.1.4)
(Phosphatidylcholine 2-acylhydrolase) (Fragment).
"Expression of A chain and B chain of beta-bungarotoxin from taiwan
banded krait: the functional implication of the interchain disulfide
bond between A chain and B chain.";
"What does beta-bungarotoxin do at the neuromuscular junction?";
-!- FUNCTION: PA2 catalyzes the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of the 2-
    acyl groups in 3-sn-phosphoglycerides. Inhibits neuromuscular
    transmission by blocking acetylcholine release from the nerve
    termini. Acts presynaptically (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphatidylcholine + H(2)O = 1-
    acylglycerophosphocholine + a carboxylate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer; disulfide-linked. The A chains have
    phospholipase A2 activity and the B chains show homology with the
    basic protease inhibitors (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phospholipase A2 family. Group I
    subfamily.
