AC   P38062;
Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (EC 3.4.11.18) (MetAP 2) (Peptidase M 2)
(Initiation factor 2-associated 67 kDa glycoprotein) (p67) (p67eIF2).
"Cloning and characterization of complementary DNA encoding the
eukaryotic initiation factor 2-associated 67-kDa protein (p67).";
"Eukaryotic methionyl aminopeptidases: two classes of cobalt-dependent
enzymes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Removes the amino-terminal methionine from nascent
    proteins.
-!- FUNCTION: Protects eIF-2 alpha-subunit from inhibitory
    phosphorylation by eIF-2 kinases. Plays a critical role in the
    regulation of protein synthesis. It also interacts with the eIF-2
    gamma-subunit.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Release of N-terminal amino acids,
    preferentially methionine, from peptides and arylamides.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 cobalt ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PTM: O-glycosylated; contains 12 O-linked GlcNAc.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M24C family.
