AC   Q3YSH3;
5'-nucleotidase surE (EC 3.1.3.5) (Nucleoside 5'-monophosphate
phosphohydrolase).
"The genome of the obligately intracellular bacterium Ehrlichia canis
reveals themes of complex membrane structure and immune evasion
strategies.";
-!- FUNCTION: Nucleotidase that shows phosphatase activity on
    nucleoside 5'-monophosphates (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A 5'-ribonucleotide + H(2)O = a ribonucleoside
    + phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 divalent metal cation per subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the surE nucleotidase family.
