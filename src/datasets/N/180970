AC   Q9PBC2;
Histidyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.21) (Histidine--tRNA ligase)
(HisRS).
"The genome sequence of the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-histidine + tRNA(His) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-histidyl-tRNA(His).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Ligase;
Nucleotide-binding; Protein biosynthesis.
