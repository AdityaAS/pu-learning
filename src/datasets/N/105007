AC   P18051;
Modification methylase BamHII (EC 2.1.1.113) (N-4 cytosine-specific
methyltransferase BamHII) (M.BamHII).
"The complete sequence of the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens proviral H2,
BamHI methylase gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: This methylase recognizes the double-stranded sequence
    GGATCC, causes specific methylation on C-5 on both strands, and
    protects the DNA from cleavage by the BamHI endonuclease.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + DNA cytosine = S-
    adenosyl-L-homocysteine + DNA 4-N-methylcytosine.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This methylase is encoded on the proviral phage H2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the N4/N6-methyltransferase family. N4
    subfamily.
