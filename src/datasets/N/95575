AC   P57959;
Lipoprotein signal peptidase (EC 3.4.23.36) (Prolipoprotein signal
peptidase) (Signal peptidase II) (SPase II).
"Complete genomic sequence of Pasteurella multocida Pm70.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein specifically catalyzes the removal of
    signal peptides from prolipoproteins (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Release of signal peptides from bacterial
    membrane prolipoproteins. Hydrolyzes -Xaa-Yaa-Zaa-|-
    (S,diacylglyceryl)Cys-, in which Xaa is hydrophobic (preferably
    Leu), and Yaa (Ala or Ser) and Zaa (Gly or Ala) have small,
    neutral side chains.
-!- PATHWAY: Lipoprotein biosynthesis; second step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase A8 family.
