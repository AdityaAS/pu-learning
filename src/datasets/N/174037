AC   Q8HXP3; Q2PFT1;
Superoxide dismutase [Mn], mitochondrial precursor (EC 1.15.1.1).
"Analysis of gene expression in cynomolgus monkey tissues by macaque
cDNA oligo-chips.";
"Structure, molecular evolution, and gene expression of primate
superoxide dismutases.";
-!- FUNCTION: Destroys radicals which are normally produced within the
    cells and which are toxic to biological systems.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 superoxide + 2 H(+) = O(2) + H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 manganese ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial matrix (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the iron/manganese superoxide dismutase
    family.
