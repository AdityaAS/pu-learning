Protein N-terminal asparagine amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.1.-) (Protein
NH2-terminal asparagine deamidase) (N-terminal Asn amidase) (NTN-
amidase) (PNAD) (Protein NH2-terminal asparagine amidohydrolase)
(PNAA).

amidohydrolase. A new component of the N-end Rule pathway.";

characterization of a new enzyme.";
-!- FUNCTION: Side-chain deamidation of N-terminal asparagine residues
    to aspartate. Required for the ubiquitin-dependent turnover of
    intracellular proteins that initiate with Met-Asn. These proteins
    are acetylated on the retained initiator methionine and can
    subsequently be modified by the removal of N-acetyl methionine by
    acylaminoacid hydrolase (AAH). Conversion of the resulting N-
    terminal asparagine to aspartate by PNAD renders the protein
    susceptible to arginylation, polyubiquitination and degradation as
    specified by the N-end rule. This enzyme does not act on
    substrates with internal or C-terminal asparagines and does not
    act on glutamine residues in any position.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
