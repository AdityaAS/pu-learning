Alpha-glucan water dikinase 1, chloroplast precursor (EC 2.7.9.4)
(Protein starch-related R1) (Protein starch excess 1).
"The Arabidopsis sex1 mutant is defective in the R1 protein, a general
regulator of starch degradation in plants, and not in the chloroplast
hexose transporter.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the incorporation of phosphate into starch-like
    alpha-glucan. Acts as an overall regulator of starch mobilization.
    Required for starch degradation, suggesting that the phosphate
    content of starch regulates its degradability.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + alpha-glucan + H(2)O = AMP + phospho-
    alpha-glucan + phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast. Note=Starch granules.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: The level of protein does not vary in a
    circadian rhythm and is stable throughout day and night (at
    protein level).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PEP-utilizing enzyme family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
