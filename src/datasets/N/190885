AC   P91919;
Triosephosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1) (TIM) (Triose-phosphate
isomerase) (Fragment).
"Towards a reconciliation of the introns early or late views:
triosephosphate isomerase genes from insects.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate = glycerone
    phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate biosynthesis; gluconeogenesis.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; D-glyceraldehyde 3-
    phosphate from glycerone phosphate: single step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the triosephosphate isomerase family.
Fatty acid biosynthesis; Gluconeogenesis; Glycolysis; Isomerase;
