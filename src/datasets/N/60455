-!- FUNCTION: Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are
    involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane
    signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the
    GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-
    effector interaction.
-!- SUBUNIT: G proteins are composed of 3 units, alpha, beta and
    gamma.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 7 WD repeats.
