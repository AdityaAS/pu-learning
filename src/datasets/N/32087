AC   Q9V3D6;
Probable cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 2
(Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 100 kDa subunit)
(CPSF 100 kDa subunit).
"The genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster.";
"Annotation of the Drosophila melanogaster euchromatic genome: a
systematic review.";
"Full length Drosophila melanogaster cDNA sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: CPSF plays a key role in pre-mRNA 3'-end formation,
    recognizing the AAUAAA signal sequence and interacting with
    poly(A)polymerase and other factors to bring about cleavage and
    poly(A) addition (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: CPSF is a heterotetramer composed of four distinct
    subunits 160, 100, 70 and 30 kDa (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA-metabolizing metallo-beta-
    lactamase-like family. CPSF2/YSH1 subfamily.
