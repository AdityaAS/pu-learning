-!- FUNCTION: Apoptotic suppressor. Inhibitor of caspase-3, -7 and -9.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with SMAC and with PRSS25; these interactions
    inhibit apoptotic suppressor activity.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P55211:CASP9; NbExp=3; IntAct=EBI-517127, EBI-516799;
    Q9NR28:DIABLO; NbExp=5; IntAct=EBI-517127, EBI-517508;
    O43464:HTRA2; NbExp=3; IntAct=EBI-517127, EBI-517086;
    Q9UHD2:TBK1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-517127, EBI-356402;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous, except peripheral blood
    leukocytes.
-!- DOMAIN: The second BIR domain is sufficient to inhibit caspase-3
    and caspase-7, while the third BIR is involved in caspase-9
    inhibition. The interactions with SMAC and PRSS25 are mediated by
    the second and third BIR domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IAP family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 BIR repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RING-type zinc finger.
