AC   P50916;
DNA replication and repair protein recF.
"Organization of the origins of replication of the chromosomes of
Mycobacterium smegmatis, Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and isolation of a functional origin from M. smegmatis.";
"Sequence analysis, purification, and study of inhibition by 4-
quinolones of the DNA gyrase from Mycobacterium smegmatis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The recF protein is involved in DNA metabolism; it is
    required for DNA replication and normal SOS inducibility. RecF
    binds preferentially to single-stranded, linear DNA. It also seems
    to bind ATP (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the recF family.
