AC   Q6CDV4;
ATP-dependent RNA helicase eIF4A (EC 3.6.1.-) (Eukaryotic initiation
factor 4A) (eIF-4A) (Translation Initiation factor 1).
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: ATP-dependent RNA helicase which is a subunit of the
    eIF4F complex involved in cap recognition and is required for mRNA
    binding to ribosome. In the current model of translation
    initiation, eIF4A unwinds RNA secondary structures in the 5'
    untranslated region of mRNAs which is necessary to allow efficient
    binding of the small ribosomal subunit, and subsequent scanning
    for the initiator codon (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the eIF4F complex, which composition varies
    with external and internal environmental conditions. It is
    composed of at least eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4G (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The Q motif is unique to and characteristic of the DEAD
    box family of RNA helicases and controls ATP binding and
    hydrolysis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DEAD box helicase family. eIF4A
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase C-terminal domain.
