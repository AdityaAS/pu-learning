AC   Q5P2I9;
tRNA(Ile)-lysidine synthase (EC 6.3.4.-) (tRNA(Ile)-lysidine
synthetase) (tRNA(Ile)-2-lysyl-cytidine synthase).
"The genome sequence of an anaerobic aromatic-degrading denitrifying
bacterium, strain EbN1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Ligates lysine onto the cytidine present at position 34
    of the AUA codon-specific tRNA(Ile) that contains the anticodon
    CAU, in an ATP-dependent manner. Cytidine is converted to
    lysidine, thus changing the amino acid specificity of the tRNA
    from methionine to isoleucine (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal region contains the highly conserved SGGXDS
    motif, predicted to be a P-loop motif involved in ATP binding.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tRNA(Ile)-lysidine synthase family.
