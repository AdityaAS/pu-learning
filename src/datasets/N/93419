2,5-dichlorohydroquinone reductive dechlorinase (EC 2.5.1.-) (2,5-DCHQ
dechlorinase) (Glutathione-dependent reductive dehalogenase).
"Cloning and sequencing of a 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone reductive
dehalogenase gene whose product is involved in degradation of gamma-
hexachlorocyclohexane by Sphingomonas paucimobilis.";
"Cloning and characterization of lin genes responsible for the
degradation of hexachlorocyclohexane isomers by Sphingomonas
paucimobilis strain B90.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the degradation of 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone
    (2,5-DCHQ) into hydroquinone (HQ) via chlorohydroquinone (CHQ).
    The conversion of CHQ to HQ by linD seems not to be essential for
    the degradation pathway of gamma-HCH in strain UT26, because the
    conversion rate of CHQ to HQ is much lower than that of 2,5-DCHQ
    to CHQ. CHQ is more efficiently degraded by linE in strain UT26.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2,5-DCHQ = chlorohydroquinone + chloride.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Chlorohydroquinone = hydroquinone + chloride.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by glutathione.
-!- PATHWAY: Gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation; fourth step.
-!- INDUCTION: By 2,5-DCHQ.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The mechanism of this reaction probably involves a
    glutathione transfer: the halogen is firstly removed through
    substitution with glutathione, which is then removed by
    displacement of the aromatic moiety by a second glutathione
    molecule, producing oxidized glutathione (GS-SG).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GST superfamily.
Aromatic hydrocarbons catabolism; Detoxification; Transferase.
