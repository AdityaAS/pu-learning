-!- FUNCTION: Basement membrane-associated chondroitin sulfate
    proteoglycan (CSPG). Has prolyl 3-hydroxylase activity catalyzing
    the posttranslational formation of 3-hydroxyproline in -Xaa-Pro-
    Gly- sequences in collagens, especially types IV and V. May be
    involved in the secretory pathway of cells. Has growth suppressive
    activity in fibroblasts.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Procollagen L-proline + 2-oxoglutarate + O(2)
    = procollagen trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline + succinate + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Iron (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Ascorbate (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum (By similarity).
    Secreted protein; extracellular space; extracellular matrix (By
    similarity). Note=Secreted into the extracellular matrix as a
    chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG).
