-!- FUNCTION: Adaptins are components of the adapter complexes which
    link clathrin to receptors in coated vesicles. Clathrin-associated
    protein complexes are believed to interact with the cytoplasmic
    tails of membrane proteins, leading to their selection and
    concentration. Alpha adaptin is a subunit of the plasma membrane
    adapter (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Assembly protein complex 2 (AP-2) is a heterotetramer
    composed of two large chains (alpha and beta), a medium chain
    (mu/AP50) and a small chain (sigma/AP17).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; coated pit; cytoplasmic side
    (By similarity). Note=Component of the coat surrounding the
    cytoplasmic face of coated vesicles in the plasma membrane (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adaptor complexes large subunit family.
