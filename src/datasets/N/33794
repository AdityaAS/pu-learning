AC   Q5RDW9;
Cleavage stimulation factor 77 kDa subunit (CSTF 77 kDa subunit) (CF-1
77 kDa subunit) (CstF-77).
-!- FUNCTION: One of the multiple factors required for polyadenylation
    and 3'-end cleavage of mammalian pre-mRNAs (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. The CSTF complex is composed of CSTF1 (50 kDa
    subunit), CSTF2 (64 kDa subunit) and CSTF3 (77 kDa subunit). CSTF3
    directly interacts with CSTF1 and CSTF2. Interacts with FIP1L1 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 9 HAT repeats.
mRNA processing; Nuclear protein; Repeat.
