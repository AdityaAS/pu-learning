Putative RNA exonuclease pqe-1 (PolyQ enhancer protein 1).
"Glutamine/proline-rich PQE-1 proteins protect Caenorhabditis elegans
neurons from huntingtin polyglutamine neurotoxicity.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Putative RNA exonuclease which protects neurons from the
    toxic effects of expanded poly-Q disease proteins. It is not known
    if this is done via participation in the pathogenic mechanism
    underlying poly-Q-induced neurodegeneration or acting as a genetic
    modifier of the age of onset or progression of neurodegeneration.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.

-!- DOMAIN: The Gln/Pro-rich N-terminus and the Arg/Asp/Glu/Lys-rich
    charged domain are critical in protecting glutamatergic ASH
    sensory neurons from degeneration. ASH neurons expressing isoforms
    lacking these domains show progressive degeneration.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the REXO1/REXO3 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 exonuclease domain.
