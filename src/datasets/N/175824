Regulatory protein spx.
"Genome sequence and comparative microarray analysis of serotype M18
group A Streptococcus strains associated with acute rheumatic fever
outbreaks.";
-!- FUNCTION: Interferes with activator-stimulated transcription by
    interaction with the RNA polymerase alpha-CTD. May function to
    globally reduce transcription of genes involved in growth- and
    development-promoting processes and to increase transcription of
    genes involved in thiol homeostasis, during periods of extreme
    stress (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the arsC family. Spx subfamily.
