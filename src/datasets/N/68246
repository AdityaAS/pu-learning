-!- FUNCTION: Conjugation of reduced glutathione to a wide number of
    exogenous and endogenous hydrophobic electrophiles.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: RX + glutathione = HX + R-S-glutathione.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: In addition to its enzymatic activity, the
    homodimer of Ya chains, called ligandin, binds various organic
    anions, xenobiotics, and azocarcinogen dyes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GST superfamily. Alpha family.
3D-structure; Transferase.
