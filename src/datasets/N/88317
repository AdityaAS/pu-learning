Bipolar kinesin KRP-130 (Kinesin-like protein Klp61F).
"The kinesin-like protein KLP61F is essential for mitosis in
Drosophila.";
"The genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster.";
"Annotation of the Drosophila melanogaster euchromatic genome: a
systematic review.";
"A Drosophila full-length cDNA resource.";
"Identification and partial characterization of six members of the
kinesin superfamily in Drosophila.";
"An essential bipolar mitotic motor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Important role in mitotic dividing cells. Microtubule
    motor required for spindle body separation. Slow plus-end directed
    microtubule motor capable of cross-linking and sliding apart
    antiparallel microtubules, thereby pushing apart the associated
    spindle poles during spindle assembly and function.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q9VKK6:CG14915; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-95528, EBI-140585;
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Specifically expressed in proliferating
    tissues during embryonic and larval development.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylation of Thr-933 during mitosis controls the
    association of Klp61F with the spindle apparatus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the kinesin-like protein family. BimC
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 kinesin-motor domain.
