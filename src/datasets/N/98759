Methyl-coenzyme M reductase I operon protein D.
"Cloning and characterization of the methyl coenzyme M reductase genes
from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum.";
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis; last step.
-!- SUBUNIT: MCR is composed of three subunits: alpha, beta, and
    gamma. The function of proteins C and D is not known.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: There are two MCR complexes in this bacteria.
    MCR II is expressed in the early growth phase. Late growth cells
    contains mostly MCR I.
