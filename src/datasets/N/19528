Calmodulin (CaM).
"Calmodulin genes in trypanosomes are tandemly repeated and produce
multiple mRNAs with a common 5' leader sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Calmodulin mediates the control of a large number of
    enzymes and other proteins by Ca(2+). Among the enzymes to be
    stimulated by the calmodulin-Ca(2+) complex are a number of
    protein kinases and phosphatases.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein has four functional calcium-binding
    sites.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 EF-hand domains.
