NADPH--cytochrome P450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4) (CPR) (P450R).
"Structurally and functionally conserved regions of cytochrome P-450
reductase as targets for DNA amplification by the polymerase chain
reaction. Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the Schizosaccharomyces
pombe cDNA.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"Large-scale screening of intracellular protein localization in living
fission yeast cells by the use of a GFP-fusion genomic DNA library.";
-!- FUNCTION: This enzyme is required for electron transfer from NADP
    to cytochrome P450 in microsomes. It can also provide electron
    transfer to heme oxygenase and cytochrome B5.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADPH + n oxidized hemoprotein = NADP(+) + n
    reduced hemoprotein.
-!- COFACTOR: FAD.
-!- COFACTOR: FMN.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; single-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the flavoprotein
    pyridine nucleotide cytochrome reductase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 FAD-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 flavodoxin-like domain.
