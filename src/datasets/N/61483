for phosphatidylcholine synthesis by the Kennedy pathway.";
-!- FUNCTION: Glycerophosphocholine glycerophosphodiesterase
    responsible for the hydrolysis of intracellular
    glycerophosphocholine into glycerol-phosphate and choline. The
    choline is used for phosphatidyl-choline synthesis. Required for
    utilization of glycerophosphocholine as phosphate source.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A glycerophosphodiester + H(2)O = an alcohol +
    sn-glycerol 3-phosphate.
-!- INTERACTION:

    P43564:YFL034W; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-31287, EBI-22823;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 2300 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GDE1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 ANK repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 GDPD domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PI-PLC X-box domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SPX domain.
