AC   Q59291; Q9PNR7;
Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.11) (ASA dehydrogenase)
(ASADH).
"Complete nucleotide sequence of the Campylobacter jejuni 72Dz asd
gene.";
"The genome sequence of the food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni
reveals hypervariable sequences.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde + phosphate +
    NADP(+) = L-4-aspartyl phosphate + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-lysine biosynthesis via DAP
    pathway; tetrahydrodipicolinate from L-aspartate: step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-methionine biosynthesis; L-
    homoserine from L-aspartate: step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-threonine biosynthesis; L-
    threonine from L-aspartate: step 2.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase
    family.
