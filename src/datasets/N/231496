AC   Q8FFC0;
Cell division protein zipA homolog.
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Interacts directly with the cell division protein ftsZ.
    Probable receptor for the septal ring structure, may anchor it to
    the inner-membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass type I
    membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the zipA family.
