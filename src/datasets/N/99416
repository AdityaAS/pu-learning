"A complex pattern of evolutionary conservation and alternative
polyadenylation within the long 3'-untranslated region of the methyl-
CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MeCP2) suggests a regulatory role in gene

-!- FUNCTION: Chromosomal protein that binds to methylated DNA. It can
    bind specifically to a single methyl-CpG pair. It is not
    influenced by sequences flanking the methyl-CpGs. Mediates
    transcriptional repression through interaction with histone
    deacetylase and the corepressor SIN3A (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with FNBP3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Note=Colocalized with methyl-CpG in
    the genome.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 A.T hook DNA-binding domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 MBD (methyl-CpG-binding) domain.
