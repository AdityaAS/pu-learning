AC   P17842;
Transcription factor IIIA (Factor A) (TFIIIA).
"Sequence variation in transcription factor IIIA.";
"A finger protein structurally similar to TFIIIA that binds
exclusively to 5S RNA in Xenopus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Interacts with the internal control region (ICR) of
    approximately 50 bases within the 5S RNA genes, is required for
    correct transcription of these genes by RNA polymerase III. Also
    binds the transcribed 5S RNA's.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Synthesized in oocytes and, in much lower
    levels, in somatic cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 9 C2H2-type zinc fingers.
