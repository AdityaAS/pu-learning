AC   P25323;
Myosin light chain kinase (EC 2.7.11.18) (MLCK).
"Characterization and bacterial expression of the Dictyostelium myosin
light chain kinase cDNA. Identification of an autoinhibitory domain.";
"Dictyostelium myosin light chain kinase. Purification and
characterization.";
-!- FUNCTION: Phosphorylates a specific serine in the N-terminus of a
    myosin light chain.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + [myosin light-chain] = ADP + [myosin
    light-chain] phosphate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Possesses an autoinhibitory domain.
    Autophosphorylation appears to increase the enzymatic activity.
    Does not have a calmodulin-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. CaMK
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
