Adipokinetic prohormone type 1 precursor [Contains: Adipokinetic
hormone 1 (Adipokinetic hormone I) (AKH-I); Adipokinetic hormone
precursor-related peptide alpha chain (APRP-alpha) (6 kDa dimeric
peptide A)].
"Molecular cloning of three distinct cDNAs, each encoding a different
adipokinetic hormone precursor, of the migratory locust, Locusta
migratoria. Differential expression of the distinct adipokinetic
hormone precursor genes during flight activity.";
"Structure of locust adipokinetic hormone, a neurohormone that
regulates lipid utilisation during flight.";
"Isolation, identification, and synthesis of AKH-I4-10 from Locusta
migratoria.";
"Isolation and structure of two novel 6-kDa dimeric peptides from the
corpora cardiaca of the insect Locusta migratoria. Molecular mass
determination by mass spectrometry.";
-!- FUNCTION: This hormone, released from cells in the corpora
    cardiaca after the beginning of flight, causes release of
    diglycerides from the fat body and then stimulates the flight
    muscles to use these diglycerides as an energy source.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the AKH/HRTH/RPCH family.
Amidation; Cleavage on pair of basic residues;
Direct protein sequencing; Flight; Neuropeptide;
