AC   Q5GRP0;
Recombination protein recR.
"The Wolbachia genome of Brugia malayi: endosymbiont evolution within
a human pathogenic nematode.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play a role in DNA repair. It seems to be involved
    in an recBC-independent recombinational process of DNA repair. It
    may act with recF and recO (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the recR family.
