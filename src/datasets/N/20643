AC   Q805F3;
Cathepsin E-A precursor (EC 3.4.23.34).
"Differential expression of two cathepsin Es during metamorphosis-
associated remodeling of the larval to adult type epithelium in
Xenopus stomach.";
-!- FUNCTION: May have a role in immune function. Probably involved in
    the processing of antigenic peptides during MHC class II-mediated
    antigen presentation (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Similar to cathepsin D, but slightly broader
    specificity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer; disulfide-linked.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endosome (By similarity). Note=The proenzyme
    is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus,
    while the mature enzyme is localized to the endosome (By
    similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed predominantly in the larval foregut
    and the anterior and posterior adult stomach.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expression levels are high in surface mucous
    cells and manicotto gland cells of the foregut epithelium of pro-
    metamorphic tadpoles. During metamorphosis, expression levels
    decrease markedly in larval epithelial cells but are high in
    proliferating adult epithelial primordia. In the adult stomach,
    expression was strongest in oxynticopeptic cells, but was also
    detected at a lower level in surface mucose cells.
-!- PTM: Glycosylated. Contains high mannose-type oligosaccharide.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase A1 family.
