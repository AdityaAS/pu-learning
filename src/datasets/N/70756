AC   P84791;
Hemoglobin subunit alpha-D (Hemoglobin alpha-D chain) (Alpha-D-
globin).
"Molecular mechanism of high altitude respiration: primary structure
of a minor hemoglobin component from Tufted duck (Aythya fuligula,
Anseriformes).";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in oxygen transport from the lung to the
    various peripheral tissues.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer of two alpha-D chains and two beta chains.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Red blood cells.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: In birds, the alpha-D chain occurs in a minor
    hemoglobin component, called hemoglobin d, which is expressed in
    late embryonic and adult life.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=15745; METHOD=Electrospray; RANGE=1-141;
    NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the globin family.
