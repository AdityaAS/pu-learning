AC   Q00826; Q5KJX9;
Probable proteasome subunit beta type 2 (EC 3.4.25.1).
"The second capsule gene of Cryptococcus neoformans, CAP64, is
essential for virulence.";
"The genome of the basidiomycetous yeast and human pathogen
Cryptococcus neoformans.";
-!- FUNCTION: The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex
    which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg,
    Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or
    slightly basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic
    activity (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cleavage of peptide bonds with very broad
    specificity.
-!- SUBUNIT: The proteasome is composed of at least 15 non identical
    subunits which form a highly ordered ring-shaped structure (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase T1B family.
