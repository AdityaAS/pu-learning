AC   Q8M9Y9;

(Endopeptidase Clp).

that restructured organelle DNAs within the green algal lineage that
led to land plants.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cleaves peptides in various proteins in a process that
    requires ATP hydrolysis. Has a chymotrypsin-like activity. Plays a
    major role in the degradation of misfolded proteins (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of proteins to small peptides in
    the presence of ATP and magnesium. Alpha-casein is the usual test
    substrate. In the absence of ATP, only oligopeptides shorter than
    five residues are hydrolyzed (such as succinyl-Leu-Tyr-|-NHMec;
    and Leu-Tyr-Leu-|-Tyr-Trp, in which cleavage of the -Tyr-|-Leu-
    and -Tyr-|-Trp bonds also occurs).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase S14 family.
Chloroplast; Hydrolase; Plastid; Protease; Serine protease.
