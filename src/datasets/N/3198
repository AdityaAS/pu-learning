AC   Q8JZR0;
Long-chain-fatty-acid--CoA ligase 5 (EC 6.2.1.3) (Long-chain acyl-CoA
synthetase 5) (LACS 5).
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Activation of long-chain fatty acids for both synthesis
    of cellular lipids, and degradation via beta-oxidation. Utilizes a
    wide range of saturated fatty acids with a preference for C16-C18
    unsaturated fatty acids (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a long-chain carboxylic acid + CoA = AMP
    + diphosphate + an acyl-CoA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane;
    single-pass type III membrane protein (By similarity). Peroxisome;
    peroxisomal membrane; single-pass type III membrane protein (By
    similarity). Microsome; microsomal membrane; single-pass type III
    membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATP-dependent AMP-binding enzyme
    family.
