Female-specific protein transformer.
"Interspecific comparison of the transformer gene of Drosophila
reveals an unusually high degree of evolutionary divergence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Member of the regulatory pathway controlling female
    somatic sexual differentiation, regulated by Sxl. Activates dsx
    female-specific splicing by promoting the formation of a splicing
    enhancer complex which consists of tra, tra2 and sr proteins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nuclear speckle (By similarity).
    Note=Speckled subnuclear compartment (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: RS domain directs localization of proteins to the speckled
    subnuclear compartment and the purpose of this localization is to
    allow colocalization and co-concentration of components of the
    splicing and splicing regulatory machinery to permit relatively
    high rates and/or efficiencies of reaction and interaction (By
    similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The sexual regulation of tra occurs through a
    mechanism of sex-specific alternative RNA splicing. The non-sex-
    specific RNA expressed in males is not translated.
