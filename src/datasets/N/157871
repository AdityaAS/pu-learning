AC   O15318;
DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit G (EC 2.7.7.6) (DNA-directed
RNA polymerase III 32 kDa polypeptide) (RNA polymerase III C32
subunit).
"Three human RNA polymerase III-specific subunits form a subcomplex
with a selective function in specific transcription initiation.";
-!- FUNCTION: May direct with other members of the subcomplex RNA Pol
    III binding to the TFIIIB-DNA complex via the interactions between
    TFIIIB and POLR3F. May be involved either in the recruitment and
    stabilization of the subcomplex within RNA polymerase III, or in
    stimulating catalytic functions of other subunits during
    initiation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: RNA polymerase III consists of about 15 different
    subunits (By similarity). Forms a subcomplex with POLR3C and
    POLR3F.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are
    found in eukaryotic nuclei: polymerase I for the ribosomal RNA
    precursor, polymerase II for the mRNA precursor, and polymerase
    III for 5S and tRNA genes.
