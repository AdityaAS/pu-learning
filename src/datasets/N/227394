-!- FUNCTION: External NADH dehydrogenase required for optimum
    cellular growth with a number of nonfermentable carbon sources,
    including ethanol. With NDE2, performes the mitochondrial
    oxidation of cytosolic NADH under these growth conditions.
    Regulates the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
    GUT2, also involved in cytosolic NADH oxydation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone = NAD(+) + ubiquinol.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P10592:SSA2; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-27294, EBI-8603;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial intermembrane
    space.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 4930 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NADH dehydrogenase family.
