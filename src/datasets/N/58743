AC   P41571;
Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) (G6PD)
(Zwischenferment).
"Isolation of cDNAs encoding 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from the mediterranean fruit fly
Ceratitis capitata: correlating genetic and physical maps of
chromosome 5.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-glucose 6-phosphate + NADP(+) = D-glucono-
    1,5-lactone 6-phosphate + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; pentose phosphate pathway; D-
    ribulose 5-phosphate from D-glucose 6-phosphate (oxidative stage):
    step 1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
    family.
Carbohydrate metabolism; Glucose metabolism; NADP; Oxidoreductase.
