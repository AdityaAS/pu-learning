AC   Q2FK15;
2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.60)
(4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase) (MEP
cytidylyltransferase) (MCT).
"Complete genome sequence of USA300, an epidemic clone of community-
acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-
    methyl-D-erythritol from CTP and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-
    phosphate (MEP) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CTP + 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate =
    diphosphate + 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol.
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; isopentenyl-PP biosynthesis via
    DXP pathway; isopentenyl-PP from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:
    step 2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ispD family.
 GO:0016114; P:terpenoid biosynthesis; IEA:HAMAP.
