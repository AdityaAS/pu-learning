AC   Q4R7Q7;
Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase M2 subunit (EC 1.17.4.1)
(Ribonucleotide reductase small subunit) (Ribonucleotide reductase
small chain).
"DNA sequences of macaque genes expressed in brain or testis and its
evolutionary implications.";
-!- FUNCTION: Provides the precursors necessary for DNA synthesis.
    Catalyzes the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides from the
    corresponding ribonucleotides (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2'-deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate +
    thioredoxin disulfide + H(2)O = ribonucleoside diphosphate +
    thioredoxin.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 iron ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Genetic information processing; DNA replication.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a large (M1) and a small chain (M2).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Two distinct regulatory sites have been defined:
    the specificity site, which controls substrate specificity, and
    the activity site which regulates overall catalytic activity. A
    substrate-binding catalytic site, located on M1, is formed only in
    the presence of the second subunit M2 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase
    small chain family.
