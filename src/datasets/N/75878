AC   P18818;
DNA-binding protein H-NS (Histone-like protein HLP-II).
"Characterization of the structural genes for the DNA-binding protein
H-NS in Enterobacteriaceae.";
-!- FUNCTION: H-NS binds tightly to ds-DNA, increases its thermal
    stability and inhibits transcription. It also binds to ss-DNA and
    RNA but with a much lower affinity. H-NS has possible histone-like
    function. May be a global transcriptional regulator through its
    ability to bind to curved DNA sequences, which are found in
    regions upstream of a certain subset of promoters. It plays a role
    in the thermal control of pili production. It is subject to
    transcriptional auto-repression. It binds preferentially to the
    upstream region of its own gene recognizing two segments of DNA on
    both sides of a bend centered around -150 (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the histone-like protein H-NS family.
