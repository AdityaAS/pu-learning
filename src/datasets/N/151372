AC   Q5E8B2;
50S ribosomal protein L2.
"Complete genome sequence of Vibrio fischeri: a symbiotic bacterium
with pathogenic congeners.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins. Required for
    association of the 30S and 50S subunits to form the 70S ribosome,
    for tRNA binding and peptide bond formation. It has been suggested
    to have peptidyltransferase activity; this is somewhat
    controversial. Makes several contacts with the 16S rRNA in the 70S
    ribosome (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit. Forms a bridge to the
    30S subunit in the 70S ribosome (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L2P family.
