AC   O06446; Q2G054;
Preprotein translocase secA subunit.
"Molecular characterization of the Staphylococcus aureus SecA
homolog.";
"The Staphylococcus aureus NCTC8325 genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in protein export. Interacts with the secY/secE
    subunits. SecA has a central role in coupling the hydrolysis of
    ATP to the transfer of pre-secretory proteins across the membrane
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus
    which comprise secA, secB, secD, secE, secF, secG and secY (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein;
    cytoplasmic side (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secA family.
