AC   Q321K6;
Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase alpha chain (EC 6.1.1.20)
(Phenylalanine--tRNA ligase alpha chain) (PheRS).
"Genome dynamics and diversity of Shigella species, the etiologic
agents of bacillary dysentery.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-phenylalanine + tRNA(Phe) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-phenylalanyl-tRNA(Phe).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per tetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta chains (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family. Phe-tRNA synthetase alpha chain type 1 subfamily.
