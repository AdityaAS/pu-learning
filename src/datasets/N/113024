AC   O19132;
Nitric-oxide synthase, brain (EC 1.14.13.39) (NOS type I) (Neuronal
NOS) (N-NOS) (nNOS) (Constitutive NOS) (NC-NOS) (bNOS).
"Molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a constitutive nitric oxide
synthase from rabbit brain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces nitric oxide (NO) which is a messenger molecule
    with diverse functions throughout the body. In the brain and
    peripheral nervous system, NO displays many properties of a
    neurotransmitter.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-arginine + n NADPH + m O(2) = citrulline +
    nitric oxide + n NADP(+).
-!- COFACTOR: Heme group (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FMN (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Metrahydrobiopterin (BH4). May stabilize the dimeric
    form of the enzyme (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Stimulated by calcium/calmodulin. Inhibited by
    n-Nos-inhibiting protein (PIN) which may prevent the dimerization
    of the protein (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Interacts with DLG4; the interaction possibly
    being prevented by the association between NOS1 and CAPON. Forms a
    ternary complex with CAPON and RASD1. Forms a ternary complex with
    CAPON and SYN1. Interacts with ZDHHC23 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; sarcolemma; peripheral
    membrane protein (By similarity). Note=In skeletal muscle, it is
    localized beneath the sarcolemma of fast-twitch muscle fiber by
    associating with the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The PDZ domain in the N-terminal part of the neuronal
    isoform participates in protein-protein interaction, and is
    responsible for targeting nNos to synaptic membranes in muscles
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NOS family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 flavodoxin-like domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PDZ (DHR) domain.
