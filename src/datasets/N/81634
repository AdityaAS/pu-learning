AC   O46613;
Interleukin-1 alpha precursor (IL-1 alpha).
"Identification of two transcripts of canine, feline, and porcine
interleukin-1 alpha.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produced by activated macrophages, IL-1 stimulates
    thymocyte proliferation by inducing IL-2 release, B-cell
    maturation and proliferation, and fibroblast growth factor
    activity. IL-1 proteins are involved in the inflammatory response,
    being identified as endogenous pyrogens, and are reported to
    stimulate the release of prostaglandin and collagenase from
    synovial cells (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein. Note=The lack of a
    specific hydrophobic segment in the precursor sequence suggests
    that IL-1 is released by damaged cells or is secreted by a
    mechanism differing from that used for other secretory proteins.
-!- DOMAIN: The similarity among the IL-1 precursors suggests that the
    amino ends of these proteins serve some as yet undefined function.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IL-1 family.
