anchored ub-fold protein 5) (AtMUB5).
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Full-length cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana.";
"MUBS: a family of ubiquitin-fold proteins that are plasma membrane-
anchored by prenylation.";
-!- FUNCTION: May serve as docking site to facilitate the association
    of other proteins to the plasma membrane.
