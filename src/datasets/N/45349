AC   Q5XHB2;
Dual specificity protein phosphatase 22 (EC 3.1.3.48) (EC 3.1.3.16).
-!- FUNCTION: Activates the Jnk signaling pathway. Dephosphorylates
    and deactivates p38 and stress-activated protein kinase /c-Jun N-
    terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein tyrosine phosphate + H(2)O = protein
    tyrosine + phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A phosphoprotein + H(2)O = a protein +
    phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family.
    Non-receptor class dual specificity subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 tyrosine-protein phosphatase domain.
