AC   P41452;
Probable DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta chain (EC 2.7.7.6) (Late
expression factor 8).
"A baculovirus gene involved in late gene expression predicts a large
polypeptide with a conserved motif of RNA polymerases.";
"The complete DNA sequence of Autographa californica nuclear
polyhedrosis virus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for late and very late gene expression. May be
    a component of the novel RNA polymerase activity induced by
    baculovirus infection.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA polymerase beta chain family.
DNA-directed RNA polymerase; Nucleotidyltransferase; Transcription;
