AC   Q97EQ4;
Phosphoheptose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.-) (Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate
isomerase).
"Genome sequence and comparative analysis of the solvent-producing
bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum.";
"Novel pathways for biosynthesis of nucleotide-activated glycero-
manno-heptose precursors of bacterial glycoproteins and cell surface
polysaccharides.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the isomerization of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate
    in D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate = D-glycero-alpha-
    D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate + D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 7-
    phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: GDP-D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose biosynthesis; first
    step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Is probably involved in the capsular polysaccharide
    (CPS) biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SIS family. GmhA subfamily.
