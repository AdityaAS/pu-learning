AC   Q87BZ2;
Glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30) (ATP:glycerol 3-phosphotransferase)
(Glycerokinase) (GK).
"Comparative analyses of the complete genome sequences of Pierce's
disease and citrus variegated chlorosis strains of Xylella
fastidiosa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Key enzyme in the regulation of glycerol uptake and
    metabolism.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + glycerol = ADP + sn-glycerol 3-
    phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycerol utilization; first (rate-limiting) step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FGGY kinase family.
