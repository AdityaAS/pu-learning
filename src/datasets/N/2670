AC   P47529;
Acyl carrier protein homolog (ACP).
"The minimal gene complement of Mycoplasma genitalium.";
-!- FUNCTION: Carrier of the growing fatty acid chain in fatty acid
    biosynthesis (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: De novo fatty acid biosynthesis.
-!- PTM: 4'-phosphopantetheine is transferred from CoA to a specific
    serine of the apo-ACP-like protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 acyl carrier domain.
