NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 21.3 kDa subunit (EC 1.6.5.3)
(EC 1.6.99.3).
"Primary structure, in vitro expression and import into mitochondria
of a 29/21-kDa subunit of complex I from Neurospora crassa.";

Neurospora genome sequence.";
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory
    chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed
    to be ubiquinone.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone = NAD(+) + ubiquinol.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + acceptor = NAD(+) + reduced acceptor.
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex I is composed of about 40 different subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane.
    Note=Importation into mitochondrion is membrane potential
    dependent.
