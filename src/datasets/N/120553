AC   P84674;
Phospholipase A2 VRV-PL-V (EC 3.1.1.4) (Phosphatidylcholine 2-
acylhydrolase).
"Mechanism of action of snake venom toxic phospholipases.";
-!- FUNCTION: PA2 catalyzes the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of the 2-
    acyl groups in 3-sn-phosphoglycerides.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphatidylcholine + H(2)O = 1-
    acylglycerophosphocholine + a carboxylate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phospholipase A2 family. Group II
    subfamily.
