RNA polymerase-associated protein LEO1 (Replicative senescence down-
regulated leo1-like protein).
"Expression of the Leo1-like domain of replicative senescence down-
regulated Leo1-like (RDL) protein promotes senescence of 2BS
fibroblasts.";
"Complete sequencing and characterization of 21,243 full-length human
cDNAs.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The parafibromin tumor suppressor protein is part of a human Paf1
complex.";
"A probability-based approach for high-throughput protein
phosphorylation analysis and site localization.";
-!- FUNCTION: The PAF1 complex is a multifunctional complex. The PAF1
    complex interacts with POLR2A. May be involved in both initiation
    and elongation, histone methylation and RNA processing.
    Overexpression of LEO1 induces cell growth arrest and premature
    senescence of fibroblasts.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the PAF1 complex, which consists of at least
    of CDC73, PAF1, LEO1 and CTR9. Interacts with CDC73.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P35222:CTNNB1; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-932432, EBI-491549;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q8WVC0-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q8WVC0-2; Sequence=VSP_020051, VSP_020052, VSP_020053;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart.
    Weakly expressed in placenta and liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the LEO1 family.
