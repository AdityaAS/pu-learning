AC   P69494; Q59AA6;
I-superfamily conotoxin precursor.
"Novel conopeptides of the I-superfamily occur in several clades of
cone snails.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits the vertebrate potassium channels Kv1.1 and
    Kv1.3, but not Kv1.2. It has no effect on HERG-type channels,
    sodium hH1 channels and Kir-type channels (IRK1) (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom duct.
-!- PTM: Contains four disulfide bonds (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the conotoxin I2 superfamily.
