AC   Q668V6;
Penicillin-insensitive murein endopeptidase precursor (EC 3.4.24.-)
(D-alanyl-D-alanine-endopeptidase) (DD-endopeptidase).
"Insights into the evolution of Yersinia pestis through whole-genome
comparison with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the removal of murein from the sacculus. May
    also facilitate integration of nascent murein strands into the
    sacculus by cleaving the peptide bonds between neighboring strands
    in mature murein (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Splits the D-alanyl-gamma-meso-2,6-diamino-
    pimelyl peptide bond connecting neighboring peptidoglycan strands.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 zinc ions per subunit. Zinc ion 1 is bound in
    the active site. Zinc ion 2 is bound at the dimer interface by
    residues from both subunits (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M74 family.
