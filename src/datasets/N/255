AC   P10316;
HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, A-69 alpha chain (MHC class I
antigen A*69) (Aw-69) (A-28).
"Exon shuffling in vivo can generate novel HLA class I molecules.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the presentation of foreign antigens to the
    immune system.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha chain and a beta chain (beta-2-
    microglobulin). Interacts with human herpesvirus 8 MIR1 protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- PTM: Polyubiquitinated in a post ER compartment by interaction
    with human herpesvirus 8 MIR1 protein. This targets the protein
    for rapid degradation via the ubiquitin system (By similarity).
-!- POLYMORPHISM: The only allele of A-69 known is A*6901 which is
    shown here.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MHC class I family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like C1-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
