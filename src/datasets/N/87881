AC   Q9KPK4;
Homoserine kinase (EC 2.7.1.39) (HSK) (HK).
"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-homoserine = ADP + O-phospho-L-
    homoserine.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-threonine biosynthesis; L-
    threonine from L-aspartate: step 4.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GHMP kinase family. Homoserine kinase
    subfamily.
