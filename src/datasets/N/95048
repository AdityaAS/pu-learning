AC   Q6G4R6;
Tetraacyldisaccharide 4'-kinase (EC 2.7.1.130) (Lipid A 4'-kinase).
"The louse-borne human pathogen Bartonella quintana is a genomic
derivative of the zoonotic agent Bartonella henselae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transfers the gamma-phosphate of ATP to the 4'-position
    of a tetraacyldisaccharide 1-phosphate intermediate (termed DS-1-
    P) to form tetraacyldisaccharide 1,4'-bis-phosphate (lipid IVA)
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + (2-N,3-O-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-
    beta-D-glucosaminyl)-(1->6)-(2-N,3-O-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-
    beta-D-glucosaminyl phosphate) = ADP + (2-N,3-O-bis(3-
    hydroxytetradecanoyl)-4-O-phosphono-beta-D-glucosaminyl)-(1->6)-
    (2-N,3-O-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-beta-D-glucosaminyl
    phosphate).
-!- PATHWAY: Lipid A biosynthesis; sixth step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lpxK family.
