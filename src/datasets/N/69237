AC   Q7SCL1; Q6MGF0;
GPI-anchored wall transfer protein 1 (EC 2.3.-.-).
"What's in the genome of a filamentous fungus? Analysis of the
Neurospora genome sequence.";
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable acetyltransferase, which acetylates the
    inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol during biosynthesis of GPI-
    anchor (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Glycolipid biosynthesis; glycosylphosphatidylinositol-
    anchor biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PIGW family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
