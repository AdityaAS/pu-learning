AC   Q46158;
Anaerobic regulatory protein (Fragment).
"Novel FNR homologues identified in four representative oral
facultative anaerobes: Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga
sputigena, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Actinobacillus
actinomycetemcomitans.";
-!- FUNCTION: It is involved in the activation of genes necessary for
    anaerobic respiration. It probably also activates genes involved
    in the production of virulence factors.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: By anaerobiosis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HTH crp-type DNA-binding domain.
