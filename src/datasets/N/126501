AC   Q9KNA8;
Deoxyribodipyrimidine photo-lyase (EC 4.1.99.3) (DNA photolyase)
(Photoreactivating enzyme).
"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
"Purification and characterization of three members of the
photolyase/cryptochrome family blue-light photoreceptors from Vibrio
cholerae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in repair of UV radiation-induced DNA damage.
    Catalyzes the light-dependent monomerization (300-600 nm) of
    cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers (in cis-syn configuration), which are
    formed between adjacent bases on the same DNA strand upon exposure
    to ultraviolet radiation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cyclobutadipyrimidine (in DNA) = 2 pyrimidine
    residues (in DNA).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate non-covalently per
    subunit. The occupancy is 0.2. Usually had equal molar flavin and
    folate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA photolyase class-1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DNA photolyase domain.
