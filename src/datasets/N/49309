AC   Q9UKH7;
HERV-K_5q13.3 provirus ancestral Env polyprotein precursor (Envelope
polyprotein) (HERV-K104 envelope protein) [Includes: Truncated surface
protein (SU)].
"Many human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) proviruses are unique to
humans.";
"Quantitation of HERV-K env gene expression and splicing in human
breast cancer.";
-!- FUNCTION: Retroviral envelope proteins mediate receptor
    recognition and membrane fusion during early infection. Endogenous
    envelope proteins may have kept, lost or modified their original
    function during evolution.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This envelope protein is encoded by a human
    specific provirus.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: HERV-K_5q13.3 has a type 2 genome. The HERV-K(HML-
    2) family contains type 1 and type 2 genomes depending on the
    absence or presence of 292 nucleotides at the 5' end of the env
    gene resulting in Env proteins of distinct sizes. Despite their
    overall retroviral envelope structure HERV-K(HML-2) type 1
    envelope proteins lack a predictable signal sequence. Subgenomic
    RNA transcripts coding for full-length envelope proteins have been
    detected for both type of genomes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the beta type-B retroviral envelope protein
    family. HERV class-II K(HML-2) subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Truncated; premature stop codon in the surface protein.
