AC   P35053;
Glypican-1 precursor (HSPG M12).
"Cloning of a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan from brain and
identification as the rat form of glypican.";
"Neuronal expression of glypican, a cell-surface
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan, in
the adult rat nervous system.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cell surface proteoglycan that bears heparan sulfate.
    May play an important role in the trophic and injury responses of
    neurons.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; GPI-anchor.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Nervous system.
-!- PTM: This cell-associated glypican is further processed to give
    rise to a medium-released species.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glypican family.
