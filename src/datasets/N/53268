AC   Q5EA62;
Fibulin-5 precursor (FIBL-5).
"Characterization of 954 bovine full-CDS cDNA sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: Promotes adhesion of endothelial cells through
    interaction of integrins and the RGD motif. Could be a vascular
    ligand for integrin receptors and may play a role in vascular
    development and remodeling (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fibulin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 EGF-like domains.
Calcium; Cell adhesion; EGF-like domain; Glycoprotein; Repeat; Signal.
