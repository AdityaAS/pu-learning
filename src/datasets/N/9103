AC   Q7UQZ8;
Acetylglutamate kinase (EC 2.7.2.8) (NAG kinase) (AGK) (N-acetyl-L-
glutamate 5-phosphotransferase).
"Complete genome sequence of the marine planctomycete Pirellula sp.
strain 1.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + N-acetyl-L-glutamate = ADP + N-acetyl-L-
    glutamate 5-phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-arginine biosynthesis; 2-N-
    acetyl-L-ornithine from L-glutamate: step 2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acetylglutamate kinase family.
