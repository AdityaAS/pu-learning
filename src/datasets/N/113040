AC   O19114;
Nitric oxide synthase, inducible (EC 1.14.13.39) (NOS type II)
(Inducible NO synthase) (Inducible NOS) (iNOS) (Fragment).
"Rabbit iducible nitric oxide synthase gene-NOS II.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces nitric oxide (NO) which is a messenger molecule
    with diverse functions throughout the body.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-arginine + n NADPH + m O(2) = citrulline +
    nitric oxide + n NADP(+).
-!- COFACTOR: Heme group (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FMN (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Metrahydrobiopterin (BH4). May stabilize the dimeric
    form of the enzyme (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Not stimulated by calcium/calmodulin (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Binds SLC9A3R1 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NOS family.
