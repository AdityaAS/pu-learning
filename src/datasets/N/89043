AC   Q875S4;
Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) (PK).
"Yeast genome duplication was followed by asynchronous differentiation
of duplicated genes.";
"Quantitative phosphoproteomics applied to the yeast pheromone
signaling pathway.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + pyruvate = ADP + phosphoenolpyruvate.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Potassium (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; pyruvate from D-
    glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate: step 5 [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pyruvate kinase family.
