AC   P10548;
Lysostaphin precursor (EC 3.4.24.75) (Glycyl-glycine endopeptidase).
"The molecular organization of the lysostaphin gene and its sequences
repeated in tandem.";
-!- FUNCTION: Lyses staphylococcal cells by hydrolyzing the
    polyglycine interpeptide bridges of the peptidoglycan.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of the -Gly-|-Gly- bond in the
    pentaglycine inter-peptide link joining staphylococcal cell wall
    peptidoglycans.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M23B family.
