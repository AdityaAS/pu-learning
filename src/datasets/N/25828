AC   P30578;
Chitin synthase 3 (EC 2.4.1.16) (Chitin-UDP acetyl-glucosaminyl
transferase 3) (Class-II chitin synthase 3) (Fragment).
"Classification of fungal chitin synthases.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a major role in cell wall biogenesis.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + (1,4-(N-acetyl-
    beta-D-glucosaminyl))(n) = UDP + (1,4-(N-acetyl-beta-D-
    glucosaminyl))(n+1).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chitin synthase family. Class II
    subfamily.
Cell wall; Glycosyltransferase; Membrane; Transferase; Transmembrane.
