AC   Q9LUB6;
F-box protein SNE (Protein SNEEZY) (Sleepy protein 2).
"Structural analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 5. X. Sequence
features of the regions of 3,076,755 bp covered by sixty P1 and TAC
clones.";
"Arabidopsis cDNA clones.";
"The Arabidopsis mutant sleepy1gar2-1 protein promotes plant growth by
increasing the affinity of the SCFSLY1 E3 ubiquitin ligase for DELLA
protein substrates.";
"Recessive-interfering mutations in the gibberellin signaling gene
SLEEPY1 are rescued by overexpression of its homologue, SNEEZY.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential component of a SCF-type E3 ligase complex that
    positively regulates the gibberellin signaling pathway. Upon
    gibberellin treatment, such complex probably mediates the
    ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of DELLA proteins (GAI,
    RGA and RGL2), some repressors of the gibberellin pathway, leading
    to activate the pathway. Can partially complement the absence of
    GID2/SLY1.
-!- PATHWAY: Ubiquitin conjugation; third step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Probable component of some SCF complex, which consist of
    some SKP1, a cullin, SNE/SLY2 and some RING box protein. Interacts
    directly with SKP1A and SKP1B.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in flowers and at much lower
    level in seedlings, rosette leaves and green siliques.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 F-box domain.
