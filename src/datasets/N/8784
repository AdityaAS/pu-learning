AC   P0A2X7; O54531; P35836;
Carbamate kinase 1 (EC 2.7.2.2).
"Carbamate kinase from Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium:
cloning of the genes, studies on the enzyme expressed in Escherichia
coli, and sequence similarity with N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase.";
"Gene structure, organization, expression, and potential regulatory
mechanisms of arginine catabolism in Enterococcus faecalis.";
"Role of mobile DNA in the evolution of vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus faecalis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reversible synthesis of carbamate and ATP
    from carbamoyl phosphate and ADP. Can also catalyze, although with
    low efficiency, the phosphorylation of bicarbonate, leading to the
    formation of carboxyphosphate, an unstable intermediate found in
    the reactions catalyzed by carbamoyl-phosphate synthase and biotin
    carboxylase. Can also use acetate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + NH(3) + CO(2) = ADP + carbamoyl
    phosphate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by
    adenosine(5')pentaphospho(5')adenosine (Ap5A), Ap6A and to a much
    lower extent by Ap4A.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid degradation; L-arginine degradation via ADI
    pathway; CO(2) and NH(3) from L-arginine: step 3 [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (predominantly) and homotetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: By arginine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the carbamate kinase family.
