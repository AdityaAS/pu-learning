Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 6A (Cytokeratin-6A) (CK 6A) (K6a
keratin) (Keratin-6 alpha) (mK6-alpha).
"The complete cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of a type II mouse
epidermal keratin of 60,000 Da: analysis of sequence differences
between type I and type II keratins.";
"The two functional keratin 6 genes of mouse are differentially
regulated and evolved independently from their human orthologs.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";

carcinogenesis in mouse skin.";
-!- FUNCTION: There are two types of cytoskeletal and microfibrillar
    keratin: I (acidic; 40-55 kDa) [K9 to K20] and II (neutral to
    basic; 56-70 kDa) [K1 to K8]. Both a basic and an acidic keratin
    are required for filament assembly.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a type I and a type II keratin. KRT6
    isomers associate with KRT16 and/or KRT17.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominates in the adult trunk skin, tongue,
    trachea/esophagus and eye. In adult skin, localization is
    restricted to hair follicles, where it is localized predominantly
    in the outer root sheath.
-!- INDUCTION: With the exception of specific body sites, keratin 6
    expression is induced under conditions of epithelial
    hyperproliferation such as wound healing, certain skin diseases,
    cancer, and by treatment of the skin with the phorbol ester PMA.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the intermediate filament family.
