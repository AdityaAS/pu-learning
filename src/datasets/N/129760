-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: GTP + oxaloacetate = GDP + phosphoenolpyruvate
    + CO(2).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activity is affected by a number of hormones
    regulating this metabolic process (such as glucagon, insulin, or
    glucocorticoids).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate biosynthesis; gluconeogenesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Major sites of expression are liver, kidney
    and adipocytes.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: In eukaryotes there are two isozymes: a cytoplasmic
    one and a mitochondrial one.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [GTP]
    family.
