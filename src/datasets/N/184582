-!- FUNCTION: TFIID is a multimeric protein complex that plays a
    central role in mediating promoter responses to various activators
    and repressors. An essential subunit binds to core promoter DNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Belongs to the TFIID complex which is composed of TATA
    binding protein (Tbp) and a number of TBP-associated factors
    (TAFs). Interacts with Tbp, Taf1, Taf11 and Taf12.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TAF2 family.
