AC   Q65729;
Genome polyprotein [Contains: Nuclear inclusion protein A (NI-A) (NIA)
(EC 3.4.22.44) (49 kDa proteinase) (49 kDa-Pro); Nuclear inclusion
protein B (NI-B) (NIB) (RNA-directed RNA polymerase) (EC 2.7.7.48);
Coat protein (CP)] (Fragment).
"Sequence of the 3'-terminal region of the RNA of a mite transmitted
potyvirus from Hordeum murinum L.";
"Potyvirus proteins: a wealth of functions.";
-!- FUNCTION: Nuclear inclusion protein B is a RNA-dependent RNA
    polymerase that plays an essential role in the virus replication
    (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: Nuclear inclusion protein A has RNA-binding and
    proteolytic activities (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolyzes glutaminyl bonds, and activity is
    further restricted by preferences for the amino acids in P6 - P1'
    that vary with the species of potyvirus, e.g. Glu-Xaa-Xaa-Tyr-Xaa-
    Gln-|-(Ser or Gly) for the enzyme from tobacco etch virus. The
    natural substrate is the viral polyprotein, but other proteins and
    oligopeptides containing the appropriate consensus sequence are
    also cleaved.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- PTM: The viral RNA of potyviruses is expressed as a single
    polyprotein which undergoes posttranslational proteolytic
    processing by the main proteinase NIa-pro resulting in the
    production of at least ten individual proteins (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potyviruses polyprotein family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase C4 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RdRp catalytic domain.
