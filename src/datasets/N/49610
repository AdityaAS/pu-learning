AC   P97687;
Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (EC 3.6.1.5) (NTPDase
1) (Ecto-ATP diphosphohydrolase) (ATPDase) (Lymphoid cell activation
antigen) (Ecto-apyrase) (CD39 antigen).
"Characterization of brain ecto-apyrase: evidence for only one ecto-
apyrase (CD39) gene.";
"Evidence for alternative splicing of ecto-ATPase associated with
termination of purinergic transmission.";
"An ecto-ATPase and an ecto-ATP diphosphohydrolase are expressed in
rat brain.";
-!- FUNCTION: In the nervous system, could hydrolyze ATP and other
    nucleotides to regulate purinergic neurotransmission. Could also
    be implicated in the prevention of platelet aggregation.
    Hydrolyzes ATP and ADP equally well.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 2 H(2)O = AMP + 2 phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Calcium.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer; disulfide-linked (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in primary neurons and astrocytes,
    kidney, liver, muscle, thymus, lung and spleen.
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GDA1/CD39 NTPase family.
