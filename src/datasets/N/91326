AC   P38662;
Lectin [Contains: Lectin alpha chain; Lectin beta chain].
"The complete primary structure of a unique mannose/glucose-specific
lectin from field bean (Dolichos lab lab).";
-!- FUNCTION: D-mannose/D-glucose-binding lectin. Requires Ca(2+) and
    Mn(2+) ions for full activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta chains.
-!- PTM: The N-terminus of alpha chain is blocked. The alpha and beta
    chains are produced by proteolytic processing, with probably the
    loss of intervening amino acid(s).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the leguminous lectin family.
Calcium; Direct protein sequencing; Glycoprotein; Lectin; Manganese;
