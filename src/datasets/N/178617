AC   P32944;
Mitosis inhibitor protein kinase SWE1 (EC 2.7.11.1).
"Properties of Saccharomyces cerevisiae wee1 and its differential
regulation of p34CDC28 in response to G1 and G2 cyclins.";
"Complete nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
X.";
"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae bud-neck proteins Kcc4 and Gin4 have
distinct but partially-overlapping cellular functions.";
-!- FUNCTION: Protein kinase that acts both on serines and on
    tyrosines. It acts as a negative regulator of entry into mitosis
    (G2 to M transition). Phosphorylates and inhibits CDC28.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with KCC4.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P25389:KCC4; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-18607, EBI-9607;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. WEE1
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
