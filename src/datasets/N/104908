AC   Q8EL95;
Putative modification methylase OB3336 (EC 2.1.1.37) (Cytosine-
specific methyltransferase) (M.OihORF3336P).
"Genome sequence of Oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from the Iheya
Ridge and its unexpected adaptive capabilities to extreme
environments.";
-!- FUNCTION: This methylase recognizes the double-stranded sequence
    ACCGGT, causes specific methylation on C-? on both strands, and
    protects the DNA from cleavage by a specific endonuclease
    (Potential).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + DNA = S-adenosyl-L-
    homocysteine + DNA containing 5-methylcytosine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the C5-methyltransferase family.
 GO:0003886; F:DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase activity; IEA:EC.
Complete proteome; Methyltransferase; Restriction system;
