Malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) (Fragment).
"Structural studies of malate dehydrogenases (MDHs): MDHs in
Brevundimonas species are the first reported MDHs in Proteobacteria
which resemble lactate dehydrogenases in primary structure.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reversible oxidation of malate to
    oxaloacetate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (S)-malate + NAD(+) = oxaloacetate + NADH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the LDH/MDH superfamily. MDH type 2 family.
