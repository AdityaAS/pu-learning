AC   O86847;
LexA repressor (EC 3.4.21.88).
"Streptomyces clavuligerus vitamin B12-dependent ribonucleotide
reductase enzyme: from protein to gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Represses a number of genes involved in the response to
    DNA damage (SOS response), including recA and lexA. In the
    presence of single-stranded DNA, recA interacts with lexA causing
    an autocatalytic cleavage which disrupts the DNA-binding part of
    lexA, leading to derepression of the SOS regulon and eventually
    DNA repair (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of Ala-|-Gly bond in repressor
    lexA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase S24 family.
