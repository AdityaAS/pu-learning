1-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase delta 1
(EC 3.1.4.11) (Phosphoinositide phospholipase C) (PLC-delta-1)
(Phospholipase C-delta-1) (PLC-III).
"Cloning and identification of amino acid residues of human
phospholipase C delta 1 essential for catalysis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The production of the second messenger molecules
    diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is
    mediated by activated phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase
    C enzymes.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-
    bisphosphate + H(2)O = 1D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate +
    diacylglycerol.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 3 calcium ions per subunit. Two of the calcium
    ions are bound to the C2 domain (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 C2 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 EF-hand domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PH domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PI-PLC X-box domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PI-PLC Y-box domain.
