    or mitogens. IFN-gamma, in addition to having antiviral activity,
    has important immunoregulatory functions. It is a potent activator
    of macrophages, it has antiproliferative effects on transformed
    cells and it can potentiate the antiviral and antitumor effects of
    the type I interferons (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
