"Role of peptide sequence and neighboring residue glycosylation on the
substrate specificity of the uridine 5'-diphosphate-alpha-N-
acetylgalactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases T1
and T2: kinetic modeling of the porcine and canine submaxillary gland
mucin tandem repeats.";
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the submaxillary salivary gland.
-!- DOMAIN: The mature protein contains tandemly repeated, identical
    sequences.
-!- PTM: Heavily O-glycosylated at most but not all Ser and Thr
    residues.
Direct protein sequencing; Glycoprotein.
