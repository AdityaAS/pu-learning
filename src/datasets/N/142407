AC   P16512;
RNA-directed RNA polymerase catalytic subunit (EC 2.7.7.48)
(Polymerase basic protein 1) (PB1) (RNA-directed RNA polymerase
subunit P1).
"Avian-to-human transmission of the PB1 gene of influenza A viruses in
the 1957 and 1968 pandemics.";
-!- FUNCTION: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which is responsible for
    replication and transcription of virus segments. Binds the
    promoter sequence of the encapsidated viral RNA. Displays an
    endonuclease activity involved in cap-stealing. Cleaves cellular
    pre-mRNA to generate primers for viral transcription.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: Influenza RNA polymerase is composed of three subunits:
    PB1, PB2 and PA.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the influenza viruses polymerase PB1
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RdRp catalytic domain.
Nucleotide-binding; Nucleotidyltransferase; RNA replication;
RNA-directed RNA polymerase; Transferase.
