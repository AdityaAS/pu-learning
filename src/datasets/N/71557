AC   Q95M30;
Tyrosine-protein kinase HCK (EC 2.7.10.2) (p56-HCK) (Hemopoietic cell
kinase).
-!- FUNCTION: May serve as part of a signaling pathway coupling the Fc
    receptor to the activation of the respiratory burst. May also
    contribute to neutrophil migration and may regulate the
    degranulation process of neutrophils (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + a
    [protein]-L-tyrosine phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tyr protein kinase family. SRC
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SH2 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SH3 domain.
