Tubulin alpha chain.
"Expression characteristics of an epsilon-subunit for the cytosolic
chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT) from oat in differently growing
tissues.";
-!- FUNCTION: Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules. It
    binds two moles of GTP, one at an exchangeable site on the beta
    chain and one at a non-exchangeable site on the alpha-chain.
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer of alpha and beta chains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tubulin family.
