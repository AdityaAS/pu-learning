AC   Q7W2D1;
30S ribosomal protein S11.
"Comparative analysis of the genome sequences of Bordetella pertussis,
Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica.";
-!- FUNCTION: Located on the platform of the 30S subunit, it bridges
    several disparate RNA helices of the 16S rRNA. Forms part of the
    Shine-Dalgarno cleft in the 70S ribosome (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Interacts with
    proteins S7 and S18. Binds to IF-3 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S11P family.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
