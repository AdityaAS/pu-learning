DNA alpha-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.26) (AGT) (Alpha-GT).
"Genes 55, alpha gt, 47 and 46 of bacteriophage T4: the genomic
organization as deduced by sequence analysis.";
"Bacteriophage T4 genome.";
"Structural evidence of a passive base-flipping mechanism for AGT, an
unusual GT-B glycosyltransferase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Is involved in a DNA modification process to protect the
    phage genome against its own nucleases and the host restriction
    endonuclease system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Transfers an alpha-D-glucosyl residue from
    UDP-glucose to an hydroxymethylcytosine residue in DNA.
-!- PATHWAY: Genetic information processing; DNA modification.
3D-structure; Glycosyltransferase; Transferase.
