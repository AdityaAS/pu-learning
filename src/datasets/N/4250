AC   O49923;
Adenosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.20) (AK) (Adenosine 5'-phosphotransferase).
"Cloning and characterization of an adenosine kinase from
Physcomitrella involved in cytokinin metabolism.";
-!- FUNCTION: ATP dependent phosphorylation of adenosine and other
    related nucleoside analogs to monophosphate derivatives. Can also
    act on the cytokinin isopentenyladenosine to produce
    isopentenyladenosine monophosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + adenosine = ADP + AMP.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Purine salvage. Cytokinin interconversion.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the carbohydrate kinase pfkB family.
Kinase; Magnesium; Purine salvage; Transferase.
