AC   Q8U1R5;
Translation initiation factor 2 alpha subunit (eIF-2-alpha) (aIF2-
alpha).
"The complete sequence of the Pyrococcus furiosus genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: eIF-2 functions in the early steps of protein synthesis
    by forming a ternary complex with GTP and initiator tRNA (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimer composed of an alpha, a beta and a gamma
    chain (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eIF-2-alpha family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 S1 motif domain.
