AC   P66981; O06130;
Tryptophan synthase alpha chain (EC 4.2.1.20).
"The complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium bovis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The alpha subunit is responsible for the aldol cleavage
    of indoleglycerol phosphate to indole and glyceraldehyde 3-
    phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-serine + 1-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate
    = L-tryptophan + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-tryptophan biosynthesis; L-
    tryptophan from chorismate: step 5 [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta chains (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the trpA family.
