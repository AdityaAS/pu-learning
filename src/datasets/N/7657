AP-2 complex subunit alpha (Alpha-adaptin) (Clathrin assembly protein
large alpha chain) (Clathrin assembly protein complex 2 alpha large
chain).
"A 38 kb segment containing the cdc2 gene from the left arm of fission
yeast chromosome II: sequence analysis and characterization of the
genomic DNA and cDNAs encoded on the segment.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: Adaptins are components of the adaptor complexes which
    link clathrin to receptors in coated vesicles. Clathrin-associated
    protein complexes are believed to interact with the cytoplasmic
    tails of membrane proteins, leading to their selection and
    concentration. Alpha adaptin is a subunit of the plasma membrane
    adaptor (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Assembly protein complex 2 (AP-2) is a heterotetramer
    composed of two large chains (alpha/apl3 and beta/apl1), a medium
    chain (mu/apm4) and a small chain (sigma/aps2) (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; coated pit; cytoplasmic side
    (By similarity). Note=Component of the coat surrounding the
    cytoplasmic face of coated vesicles in the plasma membrane (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adaptor complexes large subunit family.
