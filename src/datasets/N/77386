AC   Q71V10;
Sperm protamine P1.
"Phylogeny of the dasyurid marsupial genus Antechinus based on
cytochrome-b, 12S-rRNA, and protamine-P1 genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Protamines substitute for histones in the chromatin of
    sperm during the haploid phase of spermatogenesis. They compact
    sperm DNA into a highly condensed, stable and inactive complex (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Testis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the protamine P1 family.
