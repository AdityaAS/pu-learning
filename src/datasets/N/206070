-!- FUNCTION: Elicits tachypnea, ocular proctosis, rapid collapse and
    spasms in mice. The primary cause of death is respiratory failure.
    Selectively blocks the epsilon subunit of muscle nicotinic
    acetylcholine receptor.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- TOXIC DOSE: LD(50) is 0.369 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the waglerin family.
Acetylcholine receptor inhibitor; Direct protein sequencing;
Neurotoxin; Postsynaptic neurotoxin; Toxin.
