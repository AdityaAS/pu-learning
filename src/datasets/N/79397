-!- FUNCTION: Binds IGF-I and IGF-II with a relatively low affinity.
    Stimulates prostacyclin (PGI2) production.
-!- SUBUNIT: May interact with VPS24/CHMP3; the relevance of such
    interaction however remains unclear.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 IGFBP domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Kazal-like domain.
