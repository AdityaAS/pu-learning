AC   Q89I09;
Flagellar L-ring protein 1 precursor (Basal body L-ring protein 1).
"Complete genomic sequence of nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacterium
Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110.";
-!- FUNCTION: Assembles around the rod to form the L-ring and probably
    protects the motor/basal body from shearing forces during
    rotation.
-!- SUBUNIT: The basal body constitutes a major portion of the
    flagellar organelle and consists of four rings (L,P,S, and M)
    mounted on a central rod (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the flgH family.
