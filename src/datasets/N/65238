AC   P57814;
Phosphoheptose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.-) (Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate
isomerase).
"Complete genomic sequence of Pasteurella multocida Pm70.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the isomerization of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate
    in D-glycero-D-mannoheptose 7-phosphate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate = D-glycero-alpha-
    D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate + D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 7-
    phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Inner core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis; ADP-L-
    glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose biosynthesis; first step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SIS family. GmhA subfamily.
