AC   Q8XCS6; Q7AAW4;
Membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase C precursor (EC 3.2.1.-)
(Murein hydrolase C).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Murein-degrading enzyme. May play a role in recycling of
    muropeptides during cell elongation and/or cell division (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cleavage of the beta-1,4-glycosidic bond
    between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues,
    thereby conserving the energy in a newly synthesized 1,6-
    anhydrobond in the muramic acid residue.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; lipid-anchor (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transglycosylase slt family.
