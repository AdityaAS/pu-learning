AC   P13095; Q9VBI9;
Enhancer of split m4 protein (E(spl)m4).
"Closely related transcripts encoded by the neurogenic gene complex
enhancer of split of Drosophila melanogaster.";
"The genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster.";
"Annotation of the Drosophila melanogaster euchromatic genome: a
systematic review.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the Notch signaling pathway.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q9VKC4:CG6792; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-132651, EBI-120128;
    Q9XYR0:Traf1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-132651, EBI-120454;
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed at the time when separation of
    neural and epidermal precursors cells occurs. Mesectodermal
    expression appears shortly before the onset of gastrulation. In
    imaginal disks, expression is seen primarily within presumptive
    proneural clusters of eye-antennal, wing and leg disks.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the M4-like protein family.
