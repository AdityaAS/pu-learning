AC   Q64322;
Neural proliferation differentiation and control protein 1 precursor
(NPDC-1 protein).
"Proliferation and differentiation properties of bipotent glial
progenitor cell lines immortalized with the adenovirus E1A gene.";
"Identification of a neural-specific cDNA, NPDC-1, able to down-
regulate cell proliferation and to suppress transformation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Suppresses oncogenic transformation in neural and non-
    neural cells and down-regulates neural cell proliferation. Might
    be involved in transcriptional regulation.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the brain and nervous system. Not
    detected in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, spleen, pancreas,
    pituitary and adrenal glands. Expression increases when cultured
    neural cells are growth-arrested and begin to differentiate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NPDC1/cab-1 family.
