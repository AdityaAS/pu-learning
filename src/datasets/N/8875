-!- FUNCTION: GTP-binding protein that functions as an allosteric
    activator of the cholera toxin catalytic subunit, an ADP-
    ribosyltransferase. Involved in protein trafficking among
    different compartments. Modulates vesicle budding and uncoating
    within the Golgi complex. Deactivation induces the redistribution
    of the entire Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum,
    suggesting a crucial role in protein trafficking. In its GTP-bound
    form, its triggers the association with coat proteins with the
    Golgi membrane. The hydrolysis of ARF1-bound GTP, which is
    mediated by ARFGAPs proteins, is required for dissociation of coat
    proteins from Golgi membranes and vesicles.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PRKCABP, PSCD2, DDEF2 and PIP5K1A (By
    similarity). Interacts with GGA1. Interacts with ARFGAP1, which
    hydrolyzes GTP and thus, regulates its function.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small GTPase superfamily. Arf family.
