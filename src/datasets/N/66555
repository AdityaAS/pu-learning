AC   Q5ZZU2;
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase
(EC 5.4.2.1) (Phosphoglyceromutase) (BPG-independent PGAM) (iPGM).
"The genome sequence of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae strain 232, the agent
of swine mycoplasmosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate and
    3-phosphoglycerate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-phospho-D-glycerate + 2,3-diphosphoglycerate
    = 3-phospho-D-glycerate + 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-phospho-D-glycerate = 3-phospho-D-glycerate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 manganese ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; pyruvate from D-
    glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate: step 3.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the BPG-independent phosphoglycerate mutase
    family.
