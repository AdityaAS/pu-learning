AC   Q67WR5;
Putative GDP-L-fucose synthase 2 (EC 1.1.1.271) (GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-
mannose-3, 5-epimerase-4-reductase 2).
"Oryza sativa nipponbare chromosome 6 genomic DNA sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Two step NADP-dependent conversion of GDP-4-dehydro-6-
    deoxy-D-mannose to GDP-fucose, involving an epimerase and a
    reductase reaction (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: GDP-L-fucose + NADP(+) = GDP-4-dehydro-6-
    deoxy-D-mannose + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate biosynthesis; GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis via
    de novo pathway; GDP-L-fucose from GDP-D-mannose: step 2 [final
    step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fucose synthetase family.
 GO:0050577; F:GDP-L-fucose synthase activity; IEA:EC.
