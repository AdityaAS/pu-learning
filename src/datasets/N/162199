AC   P46179;
30S ribosomal protein S14.
"Cloning and characterization of the ribosomal protein genes in the
spc operon of a prokaryotic endosymbiont of the pea aphid,
Acyrthosiphon kondoi.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds 16S rRNA, required for the assembly of 30S
    particles and may also be responsible for determining the
    conformation of the 16S rRNA at the A site (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts proteins S3
    and S10 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S14P family.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
