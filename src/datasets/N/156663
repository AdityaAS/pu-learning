AC   Q5N605;
Ribonuclease P protein component (EC 3.1.26.5) (RNaseP protein) (RNase
P protein) (Protein C5).
"Complete genome structure of the unicellular cyanobacterium Anacystis
nidulans 6301 (Synechococcus sp. PCC6301).";
-!- FUNCTION: RNaseP catalyzes the removal of the 5'-leader sequence
    from pre-tRNA to produce the mature 5'-terminus. It can also
    cleave other RNA substrates such as 4.5S RNA. The protein
    component plays an auxiliary but essential role in vivo by binding
    to the 5'-leader sequence and broadening the substrate specificity
    of the ribozyme (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage of RNA, removing 5'-
    extranucleotides from tRNA precursor.
-!- SUBUNIT: Consists of a catalytic RNA component (M1 or rnpB) and a
    protein subunit (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the rnpA family.
