AC   Q8CZS4; Q8CZS5;
UPF0313 protein YPO0674/y3502/YP2990.
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague.";
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis KIM.";
"Complete genome sequence of Yersinia pestis strain 91001, an isolate
avirulent to humans.";
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster. The cluster is coordinated with
    3 cysteines and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UPF0313 family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1, Ref.2 and Ref.3 sequences differ from that shown
    due to a frameshift in position 511. However, it is probably a
    pseudogene resulting from truncation by frameshift mutation.
-!- CAUTION: Could be the product of a pseudogene.
