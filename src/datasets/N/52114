AC   P81424;
71 kDa F-actin-binding protein (Fragment).
"A new Tetrahymena actin-binding protein is localized in the division
furrow.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds directly to F-actin and induces actin filament
    bundling. May function as a regulator of actin filament
    organization.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Colocalized with actin in the oral apparatus
    in interphase cells. In dividing cells colocalized with actin in
    the division furrow.
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: On the 2D-gel the determined pI of this protein is:
    7.5, its MW is: 71 kDa.
-!- SIMILARITY: To yeast fimbrin.
Actin-binding; Direct protein sequencing.
