AC   Q5P9P7;
Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) (NDK) (NDP kinase)
(Nucleoside-2-P kinase).
"Complete genome sequencing of Anaplasma marginale reveals that the
surface is skewed to two superfamilies of outer membrane proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Major role in the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates
    other than ATP. The ATP gamma phosphate is transferred to the NDP
    beta phosphate via a ping-pong mechanism, using a phosphorylated
    active-site intermediate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + nucleoside diphosphate = ADP +
    nucleoside triphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NDK family.
