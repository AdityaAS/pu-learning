AC   P28327;
Rhodopsin kinase precursor (EC 2.7.11.14) (RK) (G protein-coupled
receptor kinase 1).
"The receptor kinase family: primary structure of rhodopsin kinase
reveals similarities to the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase.";
"Isoprenylation of a protein kinase. Requirement of
farnesylation/alpha-carboxyl methylation for full enzymatic activity
of rhodopsin kinase.";
"Identification of the autophosphorylation sites in rhodopsin
kinase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Phosphorylates rhodopsin thereby initiating its
    deactivation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + [rhodopsin] = ADP + [rhodopsin]
    phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; lipid-anchor.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Retina and pineal gland.
-!- PTM: Autophosphorylated.
-!- PTM: Farnesylation is required for full activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. GPRK
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RGS domain.
