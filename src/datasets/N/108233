AC   Q63358;
Myosin-9B (Myosin IXb) (Unconventional myosin-9b).
"A novel type of myosin implicated in signalling by rho family
GTPases.";
-!- FUNCTION: Myosins are actin-based motor molecules with ATPase
    activity. Unconventional myosins serve in intracellular movements.
    May be involved in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Binds
    actin with high affinity both in the absence and presence of ATP
    and its mechanochemical activity is inhibited by calcium ions.
    Also acts as a GTPase activating protein on Rho.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm; cell cortex. Cytoplasm;
    perinuclear region (By similarity). Note=In undifferentiated cells
    colocalizes with F-actin in the cell periphery while in
    differentiated cells its localization is cytoplasmic with the
    highest levels in the perinuclear region (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in testis, lung, thymus, brain,
    liver and spleen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 IQ domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 myosin head-like domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 phorbol-ester/DAG-type zinc finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ras-associating domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Rho-GAP domain.
