Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.-) (UGL) (Glycuronidase)
(Unsaturated uronic acid hydrolase) (Glycosaminoglycan hydrolase).
"Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase of Bacillus sp. GL1: novel enzyme
prerequisite for metabolism of unsaturated oligosaccharides produced
by polysaccharide lyases.";
"Crystal structure of unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase, responsible
for the degradation of glycosaminoglycan, from Bacillus sp. GL1 at 1.8
A resolution.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the hydrolysis of oligosaccharides with
    unsaturated glucuronyl residues at the nonreducing terminal, to a
    sugar or an amino sugar, and an unsaturated D-glucuronic acid
    (GlcA), which is nonenzymatically converted immediately to alpha-
    keto acid.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Partially inhibited by divalent metal ions such
    as calcium, copper, iron and mercury.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=90 uM for gellan lyase product;
      KM=200 uM for chondroitin lyase product;
      KM=226 uM for hyaluronate lyase product;
      Note= At 30 degrees Celsius and pH 6.5;
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 6.0-6.5;
    Temperature dependence:
      Optimum temperature is 45 degrees Celsius;
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 88 family.
