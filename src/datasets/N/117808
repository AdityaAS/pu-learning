AC   Q6ABX8;
Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta (EC 1.2.4.1).
"The genome sequence of the Gram-positive sugarcane pathogen Leifsonia
xyli subsp. xyli.";
-!- FUNCTION: The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the overall
    conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO(2). It contains
    multiple copies of three enzymatic components: pyruvate
    dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and
    lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Pyruvate + [dihydrolipoyllysine-residue
    acetyltransferase] lipoyllysine = [dihydrolipoyllysine-residue
    acetyltransferase] S-acetyldihydrolipoyllysine + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Thiamine pyrophosphate (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta chain (By similarity).
