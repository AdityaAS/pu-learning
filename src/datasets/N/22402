AC   Q90459;
G1/S-specific cyclin-D1.
"Zebrafish cyclin D1 is differentially expressed during early
embryogenesis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G1/S
    (start) transition.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with the CDK4 and CDK6 protein kinases to form
    a serine/threonine kinase holoenzyme complex. The cyclin subunit
    imparts substrate specificity to the complex.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyclin family. Cyclin D subfamily.
