DNA gyrase subunit A (EC 5.99.1.3).
"Genomic sequence of a Lyme disease spirochaete, Borrelia
burgdorferi.";
"Mapping of genes on the linear chromosome of the bacterium Borrelia
burgdorferi: possible locations for its origin of replication.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA gyrase negatively supercoils closed circular double-
    stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent manner and also catalyzes the
    interconversion of other topological isomers of double-stranded
    DNA rings, including catenanes and knotted rings.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP-dependent breakage, passage and rejoining
    of double-stranded DNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Made up of two chains. The A chain is responsible for DNA
    breakage and rejoining; the B chain catalyzes ATP hydrolysis. The
    enzyme forms an A2B2 tetramer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the topoisomerase gyrA/parC subunit family.
3D-structure; Antibiotic resistance; ATP-binding; Complete proteome;
