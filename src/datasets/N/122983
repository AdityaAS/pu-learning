AC   P27664;
Rod cGMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase alpha-subunit
(EC 3.1.4.35) (GMP-PDE alpha).
"Complete cDNA sequences of mouse rod photoreceptor cGMP
phosphodiesterase alpha- and beta-subunits, and identification of
beta'-, a putative beta-subunit isozyme produced by alternative
splicing of the beta-subunit gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein participates in processes of transmission
    and amplification of the visual signal.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Guanosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate + H(2)O =
    guanosine 5'-phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Oligomer composed of two catalytic chains (alpha and
    beta), an inhibitory chain (gamma) and the delta chain.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; cytoplasmic
    side (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 GAF domains.
