AC   Q45Z28;
Phospholipase A2, acidic 3 precursor (EC 3.1.1.4) (Phosphatidylcholine
2-acylhydrolase 3) (PLA-3).
"Identification and analysis of venom gland-specific genes from the
coastal taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) and related species.";
-!- FUNCTION: PA2 catalyzes the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of the 2-
    acyl groups in 3-sn-phosphoglycerides.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphatidylcholine + H(2)O = 1-
    acylglycerophosphocholine + a carboxylate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phospholipase A2 family. Group I
    subfamily.
Calcium; Hydrolase; Lipid degradation; Metal-binding; Signal; Toxin.
