AC   O51713;
Flagellar P-ring protein precursor (Basal body P-ring protein).
"Genomic sequence of a Lyme disease spirochaete, Borrelia
burgdorferi.";
-!- FUNCTION: Assembles around the rod to form the L-ring and probably
    protects the motor/basal body from shearing forces during
    rotation.
-!- SUBUNIT: The basal body constitutes a major portion of the
    flagellar organelle and consists of four rings (L,P,S, and M)
    mounted on a central rod (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the flgI family.
Complete proteome; Flagellum; Periplasmic; Signal.
