Progonadoliberin-1 precursor (Progonadoliberin I) (Medaka-type
gonadotropin-releasing hormone) (mdGnRH) (mfGnRH) [Contains:
Gonadoliberin-1 (Gonadoliberin I) (Luteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone I) (LH-RH I) (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone I) (GnRH I)
(Luliberin I); GnRH-associated peptide 1 (GnRH-associated peptide I)].
"A novel form of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the medaka, Oryzias
latipes.";
"Structural characterization of GnRH loci in the medaka genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Stimulates the secretion of gonadotropins (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the cell bodies of a cluster of
    neurons in the preoptic region.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Teleost species possess three paralogous GnRHs:
    mdGnRH and cGnRH-II have been identified in tetrapods; sGnRH has
    no tetrapod ortholog and is thought to be a duplication of cGnRH-
    II.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GnRH family.
