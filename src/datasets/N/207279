lacking XPC.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in DNA excision repair. May play a part in DNA
    damage recognition and/or in altering chromatin structure to allow
    access by damage-processing enzymes.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a 125 kDa subunit (p125) and of a 58 kDa
    subunit (p58). Interacts with CETN2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the XPC family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (AAC52500) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 50, 52 and 61.
