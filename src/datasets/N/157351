AC   O74633; Q7RVL5;
DNA-directed RNA polymerase I polypeptide 2 (EC 2.7.7.6) (RNA
polymerase I subunit 2).
"Mutation of the gene for the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase
I prolongs the period length of the circadian conidiation rhythm in
Neurospora crassa.";
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription
    of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as
    substrates. RNA polymerase I is essentially used to transcribe
    ribosomal DNA units.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: RNA polymerase I consists of 14 different subunits. This
    subunit is the second largest component of RNA polymerase I (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are
    found in eukaryotic nuclei: polymerase I for the ribosomal RNA
    precursor, polymerase II for the mRNA precursor, and polymerase
    III for 5S and tRNA genes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA polymerase beta chain family.
