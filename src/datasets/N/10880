AC   P44303;
Phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase (EC 2.5.1.54) (Phospho-2-
keto-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase) (DAHP synthetase) (3-deoxy-D-arabino-
heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase).
"Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae
Rd.";
-!- FUNCTION: Stereospecific condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
    and D-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) giving rise to 3-deoxy-D-
    arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphoenolpyruvate + D-erythrose 4-phosphate
    + H(2)O = 3-deoxy-D-arabino-hept-2-ulosonate 7-phosphate +
    phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; chorismate
    biosynthesis; chorismate from D-erythrose 4-phosphate and PEP:
    step 1.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Aromatic amino acids biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I DAHP synthetase family.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis;
Complete proteome; Transferase.
