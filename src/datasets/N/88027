-!- FUNCTION: Putative regulatory subunit of the putative trimeric
    SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK) complex, which may play a role
    in a signal transduction cascade regulating gene expression and
    carbohydrate metabolism in higher plants. The SnRK complex may
    also be involved in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis by
    phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and in assimilation of
    nitrogen by phosphorylating nitrate reductase.
-!- SUBUNIT: Subunit of a probable heterotrimeric complex consisting
    of an alpha catalytic, and a beta and gamma non-catalytic
    regulatory subunit (KINB1 or KINB2, and KING1), respectively.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in vegetative organs and, to lower
    extent, in reproductive organs.
-!- INDUCTION: Strongly induced in the dark.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase gamma
    subunit family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 CBS domains.
ATP-binding; Carbohydrate metabolism; CBS domain;
Fatty acid biosynthesis; Lipid synthesis; Nitrate assimilation;
Nucleotide-binding; Repeat.
