Green-sensitive opsin-1 (Green cone photoreceptor pigment 1) (Opsin-1,
medium-wave-sensitive 1) (Opsin RH2-1).
"Cloning and characterization of six zebrafish photoreceptor opsin
cDNAs and immunolocalization of their corresponding proteins.";
"Gene duplication and spectral diversification of cone visual pigments
of zebrafish.";
-!- FUNCTION: Visual pigments are the light-absorbing molecules that
    mediate vision. They consist of an apoprotein, opsin, covalently
    linked to cis-retinal.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Absorption:
      Abs(max)=467 nm;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Retinal double cone accessory photoreceptor
    cell outer segments.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on some or all of the serine and threonine
    residues present in the C-terminal region (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
    Opsin subfamily.
