AC   Q9DD65;
Lysozyme C precursor (EC 3.2.1.17) (1,4-beta-N-acetylmuramidase C).
"Characterization and expression of c-type lysozyme cDNA from Japanese
flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).";
"Moleculer cloning and novel repeated sequences of a c-type lysozyme
gene in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus).";
-!- FUNCTION: Lysozymes have primarily a bacteriolytic function; those
    in tissues and body fluids are associated with the monocyte-
    macrophage system and enhance the activity of immunoagents (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-linkages between N-
    acetylmuramic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in a
    peptidoglycan and between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in
    chitodextrins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Lysozyme C is capable of both hydrolysis and
    transglycosylation; it shows also a slight esterase activity. It
    acts rapidly on both peptide-substituted and unsubstituted
    peptidoglycan, and slowly on chitin oligosaccharides.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 22 family.
