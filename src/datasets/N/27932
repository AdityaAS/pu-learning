AC   Q9XSC5;
Clusterin precursor (Apolipoprotein J) (Apo-J) [Contains: Clusterin
beta chain; Clusterin alpha chain].
"Apolipoprotein J/clusterin is induced in vascular smooth muscle cells
after vascular injury.";
-!- FUNCTION: Not yet clear. It is known to be expressed in a variety
    of tissues and it seems to be able to bind to cells, membranes and
    hydrophobic proteins. It has been associated with programmed cell
    death (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Antiparallel disulfide-linked heterodimer. Interacts with
    CLUAP1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic vesicle; secretory vesicle;
    chromaffin granule. Note=Present in chromaffin granules.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the clusterin family.
Glycoprotein; Signal.
