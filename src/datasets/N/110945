AC   P43443;
Neuromedin-B precursor.
"Isolation and sequence of a cDNA encoding the precursor of a
bombesin-like peptide from brain and early embryos of Xenopus
laevis.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be a growth factor required for the high rate of
    cell division ensuing after fertilization, or may have a role as a
    secretagogue that triggers the release of stored components.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain, intestine, and ovaries and early
    embryos (stages 2 and 10).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bombesin/neuromedin-B/ranatensin
    family.
Amidation; Cleavage on pair of basic residues; Signal.
