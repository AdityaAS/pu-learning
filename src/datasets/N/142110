Mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes assembly protein RCA1
(EC 3.4.24.-) (TAT-binding homolog 12).
"A new member of a family of ATPases is essential for assembly of
mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthetase complexes in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"Identification of a set of yeast genes coding for a novel family of
putative ATPases with high similarity to constituents of the 26S
protease complex.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
XIII.";
"The YTA10-12 complex, an AAA protease with chaperone-like activity in
the inner membrane of mitochondria.";
"The formation of respiratory chain complexes in mitochondria is under
the proteolytic control of the m-AAA protease.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts as component of the m-AAA protease complex which is
    a ATP-dependent metalloprotease mediating degradation of non-
    assembled mitochondrial inner membrane proteins. The complex is
    necessary for the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain and
    ATPase complexes. Function both in posttranslational assembly and
    in the turnover of mistranslated or misfolded polypeptides.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion (Potential).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the 850 kDa m-AAA protease complex (YTA10-
    12) which consists of multiple copies of RCA1 AND AFG3.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P39925:AFG3; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-14858, EBI-2317;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 11500 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the AAA ATPase
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the peptidase
    M41 family.
