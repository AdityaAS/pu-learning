AC   Q6FWS1;
Nucleolar GTP-binding protein 2.
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: GTPase that associates with pre-60S ribosomal subunits
    in the nucleolus and is required for their nuclear export and
    maturation (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nucleolus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MMR1/HSR1 GTP-binding protein family.
    NOG2 subfamily.
