AC   Q6FV34;
L-aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase-phosphopantetheinyl
transferase (EC 2.7.8.-) (AASD-PPT).
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the transfer of a 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety
    from coenzyme A to a serine residue of acceptor proteins, such as
    alpha-aminoadipate reductase. Necessary for alpha-aminoadipate
    reductase activity (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CoA-[4'-phosphopantetheine] + apo-[acyl-
    carrier-protein] = adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + holo-[acyl-
    carrier-protein].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the P-Pant transferase superfamily. AcpS
    family.
Complete proteome; Transferase.
