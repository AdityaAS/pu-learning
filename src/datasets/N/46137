Dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3).
"Mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase gene of trimethoprim-
resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae.";
"Complete genome sequence of a virulent isolate of Streptococcus
pneumoniae.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate + NADP(+) = 7,8-
    dihydrofolate + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis;
    tetrahydrofolate from 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-
    dihydropteridine diphosphate and 4-aminobenzoate: step 3 [final
    step].
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Strains 1/1, 21, 30, 56 and 92 are trimethoprim
    resistant.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The reaction catalyzed by this enzyme represents an
    essential step for de novo glycine and purine synthesis, DNA
    precursor synthesis, and for the conversion of dUMP to dTMP.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dihydrofolate reductase family.
Antibiotic resistance; Complete proteome; NADP; One-carbon metabolism;
Oxidoreductase; Trimethoprim resistance.
