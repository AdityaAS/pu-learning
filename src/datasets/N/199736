AC   Q8K3K1;
Usherin precursor (Usher syndrome type-2A protein homolog) (Usher
syndrome type IIa protein homolog).
"Identification of the mouse and rat orthologs of the gene mutated in
Usher syndrome type IIA and the cellular source of USH2A mRNA in
retina, a target tissue of the disease.";
"Scaffold protein harmonin (USH1C) provides molecular links between
Usher syndrome type 1 and type 2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in hearing and vision (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with collagen IV and fibronectin via its
    laminin EGF-like domains. Interaction with collagen may be
    required for stable integration into the basement membrane.
    Interacts with USH1C and WHRN (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=1;
      Comment=A number of isoforms are produced;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q8K3K1-1; Sequence=Displayed;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Present in the synaptic terminals of inner ear
    hair cells (at protein level). Predominantly expressed in the
    retina and cochlea. Weakly expressed in brain and kidney.
    Detectable from E17 in the neural epithelium, but not in the
    retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the developing retina. After
    birth, it is expressed at P7 and remains expressed during
    adulthood.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 fibronectin type-III domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 10 laminin EGF-like domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 laminin N-terminal domain.
