"Yellow jacket venom allergens, hyaluronidase and phospholipase:
sequence similarity and antigenic cross-reactivity with their hornet
and wasp homologs and possible implications for clinical allergy.";
"Structure of recombinant Ves v 2 at 2.0 Angstrom resolution:
structural analysis of an allergenic hyaluronidase from wasp venom.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play a role in reproduction (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Random hydrolysis of 1->4-linkages between N-
    acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and D-glucuronate residues in
    hyaluronate.
-!- ALLERGEN: Causes an allergic reaction in human.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 56 family.
