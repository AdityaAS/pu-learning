AC   Q9RT44;
Nuclease sbcCD subunit C.
"Genome sequence of the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus
radiodurans R1.";
-!- FUNCTION: SbcCD cleaves DNA hairpin structures. These structures
    can inhibit DNA replication and are intermediates in certain DNA
    recombination reactions. The complex acts as a 3'->5' double
    strand exonuclease that can open hairpins. It also has a 5'
    single-strand endonuclease activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of sbcC and sbcD (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SMC family. SbcC subfamily.
