Dynein light chain 1, cytoplasmic (Dynein light chain LC8-type 1) (8
kDa dynein light chain) (DLC8) (Protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric
oxide synthase) (PIN).
"Cloning and structure of a rabbit protein inhibitor of neuronal
nitric oxide synthase (PIN) gene and its pseudogene.";
"Solution structure of a protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide
synthase.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in some aspects of dynein-related
    intracellular transport and motility. May play a role in changing
    or maintaining the spatial distribution of cytoskeletal structures
    (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: Binds and inhibits the catalytic activity of neuronal
    nitric oxide synthase (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Consists of at least two heavy chains and a number of
    intermediate and light chains (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dynein light chain family.
