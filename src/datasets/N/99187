"Mdm31 and Mdm32 are inner membrane proteins required for maintenance
of mitochondrial shape and stability of mitochondrial DNA nucleoids in
yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the organization of the mitochondrial
    membranes and the global structure of the mitochondria. Also
    required for mitochondrial distribution and mobility as well as
    for the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA nucleoids structures.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with MDM31. Participates to a complex of about
    175 kDa.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 10400 molecules/cell.
