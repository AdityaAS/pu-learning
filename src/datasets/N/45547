AC   Q8SRS0;
Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (EC 3.6.1.23)
(dUTPase) (dUTP pyrophosphatase).
"Genome sequence and gene compaction of the eukaryote parasite
Encephalitozoon cuniculi.";
-!- FUNCTION: This enzyme is involved in nucleotide metabolism: it
    produces dUMP, the immediate precursor of thymidine nucleotides
    and it decreases the intracellular concentration of dUTP so that
    uracil cannot be incorporated into DNA (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: dUTP + H(2)O = dUMP + diphosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: De novo synthesis of thymidylate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dUTPase family.
 GO:0004170; F:dUTP diphosphatase activity; IEA:EC.
