AC   Q43299;
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31) (PEPCase) (PEPC).
"The C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase) from grain
Amaranth.";
-!- FUNCTION: Through the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
    it forms oxaloacetate, a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid source for
    the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphate + oxaloacetate = H(2)O +
    phosphoenolpyruvate + CO(2).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: By light-reversible phosphorylation (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Tricarboxylic acid cycle. This isozyme is involved in C4
    photosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PEPCase family.
Allosteric enzyme; Carbon dioxide fixation; Lyase; Phosphorylation;
Photosynthesis; Tricarboxylic acid cycle.
