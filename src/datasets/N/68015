Glutathione synthetase (EC 6.3.2.3) (Glutathione synthase) (GSH
synthetase) (GSH-S) (GSHase).
"Analysis of the chromosome sequence of the legume symbiont
Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine + glycine =
    ADP + phosphate + glutathione.
-!- PATHWAY: Sulfur metabolism; glutathione biosynthesis; glutathione
    from L-cysteine and L-glutamate: step 2 [final step].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic GSH synthase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ATP-grasp domain.
ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Glutathione biosynthesis; Ligase;
