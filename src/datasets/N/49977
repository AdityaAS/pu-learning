AC   O13146;
Ephrin type-A receptor 3 precursor (EC 2.7.10.1) (Tyrosine-protein
kinase receptor ZEK1) (EPH-like kinase 1).
"Novel Eph-family receptor tyrosine kinase is widely expressed in the
developing zebrafish nervous system.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for members of the ephrin-B family. May play a
    role in early pattern formation within the developing nervous
    system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + a
    [protein]-L-tyrosine phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed in the developing zebrafish
    nervous system.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tyr protein kinase family. Ephrin
    receptor subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 fibronectin type-III domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain.
