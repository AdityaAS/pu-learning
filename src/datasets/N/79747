AC   Q9ZDR0;
Isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP] (EC 1.1.1.42) (Oxalosuccinate
decarboxylase) (IDH) (NADP(+)-specific ICDH) (IDP).
"The genome sequence of Rickettsia prowazekii and the origin of
mitochondria.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Isocitrate + NADP(+) = 2-oxoglutarate + CO(2)
    + NADPH.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Oxalosuccinate + NADP(+) = 2-oxoglutarate +
    CO(2) + NADPH.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the isocitrate and isopropylmalate
    dehydrogenases family.
