Lupus La protein homolog (La ribonucleoprotein) (La autoantigen
homolog) (Fragment).
"Sjogren's syndrome nuclear antigen B (La): cDNA cloning, structural
domains, and autoepitopes.";
-!- FUNCTION: La protein plays a role in the transcription of RNA
    polymerase III. It is most probably a transcription termination
    factor. Binds to the 3' termini of virtually all nascent
    polymerase III transcripts. It is associated with precursor forms
    of RNA polymerase III transcripts including tRNA and 4.5S, 5S, 7S,
    and 7-2 RNAs.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with DDX15. May interact with RUFY1 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RRM (RNA recognition motif) domain.
Nuclear protein; Phosphorylation; RNA-binding.
