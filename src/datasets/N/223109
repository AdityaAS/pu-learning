"A 570-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 28.0-40.1 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Protein complexes of the Escherichia coli cell envelope.";
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein; periplasmic side. Note=Has been isolated in association
    with the inner membrane, suggesting it may be tethered to the
    membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: To E.coli yihF and H.influenzae HI1236.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (AAA68926) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 422.
