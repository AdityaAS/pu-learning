AC   Q12056;
Iron sulfur cluster assembly protein 2, mitochondrial precursor (Iron
sulfur cluster scaffold protein 2).
"Sequence and analysis of a 33 kb fragment from the right arm of
chromosome XV of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XV.";
"Saccharomyces cerevisiae ISU1 and ISU2: members of a well-conserved
gene family for iron-sulfur cluster assembly.";

-!- FUNCTION: Involved in iron homeostasis within the mitochondrion
    where it is involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur proteins.
    Essential for de novo biosynthesis of mitochondrial and
    cytoplasmic iron sulfur proteins. May also be involved in the
    repair of iron sulfur clusters.
-!- COFACTOR: Contains 2 2Fe-2S clusters per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial matrix.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 3420 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nifU family.
