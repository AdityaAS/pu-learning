AC   Q9PIK8;
Lipid-A-disaccharide synthase (EC 2.4.1.182).
"The genome sequence of the food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni
reveals hypervariable sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: Condensation of UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine and 2,3-
    diacylglucosamine-1-phosphate to form lipid A disaccharide, a
    precursor of lipid A, a phosphorylated glycolipid that anchors the
    lipopolysaccharide to the outer membrane of the cell (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)glucosamine
    + 2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-beta-D-glucosaminyl 1-phosphate
    = UDP + 2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-D-glucosaminyl-1,6-beta-D-
    2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-beta-D-glucosaminyl 1-phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Lipid A biosynthesis; fifth step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lpxB family.
Complete proteome; Glycosyltransferase; Lipid A biosynthesis;
Lipid synthesis; Transferase.
