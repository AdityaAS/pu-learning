AC   Q6GDC9;
Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit hisH (EC 2.4.2.-) (IGP
synthase glutamine amidotransferase subunit) (IGP synthase subunit
hisH) (ImGP synthase subunit hisH) (IGPS subunit hisH).
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: IGPS catalyzes the conversion of PRFAR and glutamine to
    IGP, AICAR and glutamate. The hisH subunit provides the glutamine
    amidotransferase activity that produces the ammonia necessary to
    hisF for the synthesis of IGP and AICAR (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5-[(5-phospho-1-deoxyribulos-1-
    ylamino)methylideneamino]-1-(5-phosphoribosyl)imidazole-4-
    carboxamide + L-glutamine = imidazole-glycerol phosphate + 5-
    aminoimidazol-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide + L-glutamate + H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-histidine biosynthesis; L-
    histidine from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate: step 5.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of hisH and hisF (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 glutamine amidotransferase type-1 domain.
