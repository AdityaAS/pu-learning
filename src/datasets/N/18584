Probable cytochrome P450 CYP36A1 (EC 1.14.-.-).
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate
    monooxygenases. They oxidize a variety of structurally unrelated
    compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics.
