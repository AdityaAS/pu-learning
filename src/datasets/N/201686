AC   Q801E1;
Ventral anterior homeobox 2.
"Hedgehog signalling maintains the optic stalk-retinal interface
through the regulation of Vax gene activity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for closure of the choroid fissure and together
    with Vax1 is required for optic nerve differentiation and to limit
    retinal development to the optic cup.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the anterior neural keel and
    later in the preoptic area, optic stalk and ventral retina.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: By 7 somites, detected in the anterior brain
    and expression is strong within the optic stalks, preoptic area
    and telencephalon by 12 somites. By 16 somites, expression in the
    telencephalon is reduced but that in the preoptic area, optic
    stalk and ventral retina remains and this pattern of expression is
    similiar at 24 hpf (hours post-fertilization). By 48 hpf,
    expression is restricted to the ventral preoptic area, anterior
    dorsal hypothalamus and ventral retina.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the EMX homeobox family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 homeobox DNA-binding domain.
