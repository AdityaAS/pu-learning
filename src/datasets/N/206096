AC   Q95107;
Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP).
"N-WASP, a novel actin-depolymerizing protein, regulates the cortical
cytoskeletal rearrangement in a PIP2-dependent manner downstream of
tyrosine kinases.";
-!- FUNCTION: Regulates actin polymerization by stimulating the actin-
    nucleating activity of the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3)
    complex. Binds to HSF1/HSTF1 and forms a complex on heat shock
    promoter elements (HSE) that negatively regulates HSP90
    expression.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds actin and the Arp2/3 complex. Interacts with CDC42.
    Binds to SH3 domains of GRB2. Interacts with the C-terminal SH3
    domain of DNMBP. Interacts with the WW domains of PRPF40A/FBP11
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity). Note=Preferentially localized in the cytoplasm when
    phosphorylated and in the nucleus when unphosphorylated (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CRIB domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 WH1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 WH2 domains.
