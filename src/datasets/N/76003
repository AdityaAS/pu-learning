Homer protein homolog 3 (Homer-3).
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Homer regulates the association of group 1 metabotropic glutamate
receptors with multivalent complexes of homer-related, synaptic
proteins.";
"Homer binds a novel proline-rich motif and links group 1 metabotropic
glutamate receptors with IP3 receptors.";
"Agonist-independent activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors by
the intracellular protein Homer.";
"Comprehensive identification of phosphorylation sites in postsynaptic
density preparations.";
-!- FUNCTION: Postsynaptic density scaffolding protein. Binds and
    cross-links cytoplasmic regions of GRM1, GRM5, ITPR1, DNM3, RYR1,
    RYR2, SHANK1 and SHANK3. By physically linking GRM1 and GRM5 with
    ER-associated ITPR1 receptors it aids the coupling of surface
    receptors to intracellular calcium release. Isoforms can be
    differently regulated and may play an important role in
    maintaining the plasticity at glutamatergic synapses (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Isoform 1 and isoform 2 encode coiled-coil structures
    that mediate homo- and heteromultimerization.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Note=Postsynaptic
    density of neuronal cells (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q99JP6-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q99JP6-2; Sequence=VSP_009078;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the cerebellum, hippocampus, lung
    and thymus.
-!- DOMAIN: The WH1 domain interacts with the PPXXF motif in GRM1,
    GRM5, RYR1, RYR2, ITPR1, SHANK 1 and SHANK3.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Homer family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 WH1 domain.
