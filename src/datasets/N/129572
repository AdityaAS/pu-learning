AC   Q74ZR2;
Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 4 catalytic subunit (EC 3.1.3.16)
(PP4C).
"The Ashbya gossypii genome as a tool for mapping the ancient
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the dephosphorylation and activation of the
    transcription factor GLN3 in response to nutrient availability.
    Forms the histone H2A phosphatase complex in association with the
    regulatory subunits PSY2 and PSY4, which dephosphorylates 'Ser-
    128' of histone H2A that has been displaced from sites of DNA
    lesions in the double-stranded DNA break repair process.
    Dephosphorylation is necessary for efficient recovery from the DNA
    damage checkpoint (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A phosphoprotein + H(2)O = a protein +
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 iron ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 manganese ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Catalytic subunit of the histone H2A phosphatase complex
    (HTP-C) containing PPH3, PSY2 and PSY4 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PPP phosphatase family. PP-X subfamily.
Complete proteome; Hydrolase; Iron; Manganese; Metal-binding;
