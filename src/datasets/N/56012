AC   O04395;
Flavonol synthase/flavanone 3-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.23)
(EC 1.14.11.9) (FLS) (Fragment).
"Cloning and expression of a flavonol synthase gene from common stock
(Matthiola incana).";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of flavonols from
    dihydroflavonols. It can act on dihydrokaempferol to produce
    kaempferol, on dihydroquercetin to produce quercitin and on
    dihydromyricetin to produce myricetin.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A dihydroflavonol + 2-oxoglutarate + O(2) = a
    flavonol + succinate + CO(2) + H(2)O.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A flavanone + 2-oxoglutarate + O(2) = a
    dihydroflavonol + succinate + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 ascorbate molecule per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 iron ion per subunit.
-!- PATHWAY: Secondary metabolite biosynthesis; flavonoid
    biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the iron/ascorbate-dependent oxidoreductase
    family.
