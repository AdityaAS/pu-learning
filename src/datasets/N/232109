AC   Q6UIM1;
Zinc finger HIT domain-containing protein 3 (Thyroid receptor-
interacting protein 3) (TRIP-3) (Thyroid hormone receptor interactor
3) (Fragment).
"Elevated gene expression levels distinguish human from non-human
primate brains.";
-!- FUNCTION: Thyroid receptor interacting proteins (TRIPs)
    specifically interact with the ligand binding domain of the
    thyroid receptor (TR). TRIP3 requires the presence of thyroid
    hormone for its interaction (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HIT-type zinc finger.
