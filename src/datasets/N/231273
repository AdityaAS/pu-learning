Zinc finger protein 40 (Human immunodeficiency virus type I enhancer-
binding protein 1) (HIV-EP1) (Major histocompatibility complex-binding
protein 1) (MBP-1) (Positive regulatory domain II-binding factor 1)
(PRDII-BF1).
"A DNA-binding protein containing two widely separated zinc finger
motifs that recognize the same DNA sequence.";
"A large protein containing zinc finger domains binds to related
sequence elements in the enhancers of the class I major
histocompatibility complex and kappa immunoglobulin genes.";
"Large-scale characterization of HeLa cell nuclear phosphoproteins.";
"High-resolution three-dimensional structure of a single zinc finger
from a human enhancer binding protein in solution.";
"High-resolution solution structure of the double Cys2His2 zinc finger
from the human enhancer binding protein MBP-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein specifically binds to the DNA sequence 5'-
    GGGACTTTCC-3' which is found in the enhancer elements of numerous
    viral promoters such as those of SV40, CMV, or HIV1. In addition,
    related sequences are found in the enhancer elements of a number
    of cellular promoters, including those of the class I MHC,
    interleukin-2 receptor, and interferon-beta genes. It may act in
    T-cell activation.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P54253:ATXN1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-722264, EBI-930964;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- INDUCTION: By mitogens and phorbol ester.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains two sets of 2 zinc-fingers, which are widely
    separated and recognize the same DNA sequence. There is a fifth
    zinc-finger in-between.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 C2H2-type zinc fingers.
