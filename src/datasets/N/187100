AC   Q23623;
Probable queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.29) (tRNA-guanine
transglycosylase) (Guanine insertion enzyme).
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Exchanges the guanine residue with 7-aminomethyl-7-
    deazaguanine in tRNAs with GU(N) anticodons (tRNA-Asp, -Asn, -His
    and -Tyr). After this exchange, a cyclopentendiol moiety is
    attached to the 7-aminomethyl group of 7-deazaguanine, resulting
    in the hypermodified nucleoside queuosine (Q) (7-(((4,5-cis-
    dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-yl)amino)methyl)-7-deazaguanosine) (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: tRNA guanine + queuine = tRNA queuine +
    guanine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase family.
