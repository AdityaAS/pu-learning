AC   Q9X172;
Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (EC 6.1.1.17) (Glutamate--tRNA ligase 1)
(GluRS 1).
"Evidence for lateral gene transfer between Archaea and Bacteria from
genome sequence of Thermotoga maritima.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-glutamate + tRNA(Glu) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-glutamyl-tRNA(Glu).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Ligase;
