AC   P27988;
Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl CoA synthase alpha subunit
(EC 2.3.1.169) (Acetyl CoA synthase subunit) (CODH/ACS) (ACS subunit).
"The primary structure of the subunits of carbon monoxide
dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase from Clostridium thermoaceticum.";
"Identification of a cysteine involved in the interaction between
carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and corrinoid/Fe-S protein from
Clostridium thermoaceticum.";
"A Ni-Fe-Cu center in a bifunctional carbon monoxide
dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase.";
"Ni-Zn-[Fe4-S4] and Ni-Ni-[Fe4-S4] clusters in closed and open
subunits of acetyl-CoA synthase/carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.";
-!- FUNCTION: The beta subunit generates CO from CO(2), while the
    alpha subunit (this protein) combines the CO with CoA and a methyl
    group to form acetyl-CoA. The methyl group, which is incorporated
    into acetyl-CoA, is transferred to the alpha subunit by a
    corrinoid iron-sulfur protein.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + corrinoid protein = CO +
    methylcorrinoid protein + CoA.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 nickel ions per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster per subunit.
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta chains.
