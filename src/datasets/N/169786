AC   Q9LP46;
Protein SCAR3 (AtSCAR3) (Protein WAVE2).
"Activation of Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization by plant
proteins distantly related to Scar/WAVE.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"NAPP and PIRP encode subunits of a putative wave regulatory protein
complex involved in plant cell morphogenesis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in regulation of actin and microtubule
    organization. Part of a WAVE complex that activates the Arp2/3
    complex. Regulates trichome branch positioning and expansion.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds BRK1.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in expanding cotyledons, expanding
    leaves and expanding siliques containing developing embryos.
    Detected in unopened flower buds. Reduced expression in mature
    leaves and mature cotyledons.
-!- DOMAIN: Activates the Arp2/3 complex and binds actin through the
    C-terminal VCA (verprolin homology/cofilin homology/acidic) domain
    consisting of a WH2 domain followed by an Arp2/3-binding acidic
    motif (A), separated by a conserved linker region (C). Binds BRK1
    through the N-terminal Scar homology domain (SHD).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 WH2 domain.
Actin-binding; Cytoskeleton.
