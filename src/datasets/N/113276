AC   Q9CBW6;
NAD-dependent deacetylase (EC 3.5.1.-) (Regulatory protein SIR2
homolog).
"Massive gene decay in the leprosy bacillus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Modulates the activities of several enzymes which are
    inactive in their acetylated form (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NAD(+) + an acetylprotein = nicotinamide + O-
    acetyl-ADP-ribose + a protein.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sirtuin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 deacetylase sirtuin-type domain.
