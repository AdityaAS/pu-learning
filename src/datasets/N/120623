AC   Q9I845;
Phospholipase A2 cPt09 precursor (EC 3.1.1.4) (Phosphatidylcholine 2-
acylhydrolase).
-!- FUNCTION: PA2 catalyzes the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of the 2-
    acyl groups in 3-sn-phosphoglycerides (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphatidylcholine + H(2)O = 1-
    acylglycerophosphocholine + a carboxylate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phospholipase A2 family. Group I
    subfamily.
