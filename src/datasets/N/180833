ligase) (HisRS).
"Isolation, structure and expression of mammalian genes for histidyl-
tRNA synthetase.";
"Structural analysis of the 5' region of the chromosomal gene for
hamster histidyl-tRNA synthetase.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-histidine + tRNA(His) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-histidyl-tRNA(His).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 WHEP-TRS domain.
