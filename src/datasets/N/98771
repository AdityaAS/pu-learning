-!- FUNCTION: Modulates the transcription repressor activity of DAXX
    by recruiting it to the nucleolus (By similarity). May be an
    inhibitor of TERT telomerase activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds to NOL1, DAXX, PINX1 and TERT (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 FHA domain.
