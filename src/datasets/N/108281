AC   P52179;
Myomesin-1 (190 kDa titin-associated protein) (190 kDa connectin-
associated protein).
"The globular head domain of titin extends into the center of the
sarcomeric M band. cDNA cloning, epitope mapping and immunoelectron
microscopy of two titin-associated proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Major component of the vertebrate myofibrillar M band.
    Binds myosin, titin, and light meromyosin. This binding is dose
    dependent.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with TTN/titin (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 fibronectin type-III domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domains.
