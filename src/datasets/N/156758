AC   Q6A759;
Ribonuclease PH (EC 2.7.7.56) (RNase PH) (tRNA
nucleotidyltransferase).
"The complete genome sequence of Propionibacterium acnes, a commensal
of human skin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Phosphorolytic exoribonuclease that removes nucleotide
    residues following the -CCA terminus of tRNA and adds nucleotides
    to the ends of RNA molecules by using nucleoside diphosphates as
    substrates (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: tRNA(n+1) + phosphate = tRNA(n) + a nucleoside
    diphosphate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNase PH family.
