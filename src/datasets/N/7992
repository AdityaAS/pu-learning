AC   Q8JHE9;
Gamma-secretase subunit Aph-1b (Anterior-pharynx-defective protein
1b).
"aph-1 and pen-2 are required for Notch pathway signaling, gamma-
secretase cleavage of betaAPP, and presenilin protein accumulation.";
"Hematopoietic gene expression profile in zebrafish kidney marrow.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, an
    endoprotease complex that catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of
    integral proteins such as Notch receptors. It may represent a
    stabilizing cofactor for the presenilin homodimer that promotes
    the formation of a stable complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the gamma-secretase complex, a complex
    composed of a presenilin homodimer (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin
    (NCSTN), APH1 and PEN2 (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the APH-1 family.
Membrane; Notch signaling pathway; Transmembrane.
