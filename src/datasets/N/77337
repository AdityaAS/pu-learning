AC   P15341;
Sperm protamine P1 (Cysteine-rich protamine) (Protamine ST1).
"Sequence of a horse protamine-1 (PRM-1) gene and its flanking
regions.";
"Isolation and characterization of two protamines St1 and St2 from
stallion spermatozoa, and amino-acid sequence of the major protamine
St1.";
"The major protamine from stallion sperm. Isolation and amino-acid
sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Protamines substitute for histones in the chromatin of
    sperm during the haploid phase of spermatogenesis. They compact
    sperm DNA into a highly condensed, stable and inactive complex.
-!- SUBUNIT: Cross-linked by interchain disulfide bonds around the
    DNA-helix.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Testis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the protamine P1 family.
