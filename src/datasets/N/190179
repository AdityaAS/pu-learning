-!- FUNCTION: Can mediate activation of c-Jun and NF-kappa-B. May
    promote caspase-independent cell death (By similarity). Isoform 2
    and isoform 3 may act as decoy receptors.
-!- SUBUNIT: Associates with TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3 and TRAF5 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Isoform 1: Cell membrane; single-pass type I
    membrane protein (Probable). Isoform 3: Cell membrane; single-pass
    type I membrane protein (Probable). Isoform 4: Cell membrane;
    single-pass type I membrane protein (Probable). Isoform 2:
    Secreted protein (Probable).

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in adult brain, and in
    embryos from day 11-17, but not earlier. Detected in embryonic
    brain and epithelium, and at lower levels in adult heart, lung and
    liver. In neonatal mice, mainly in hair follicles and neuron-like
    cells in the cerebellum, but not in the skin epidermis. Isoform 3
    was found in embryonic day 17.5 skin but not in brain and liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 TNFR-Cys repeats.
