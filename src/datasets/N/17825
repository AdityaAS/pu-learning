Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein homolog.

implications for cancer predisposition.";

arrays.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a central role in DNA repair by facilitating
    cellular response to DNA repair. Required for appropriate cell
    cycle arrests after ionizing irradiation in both the S-phase and
    the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Involved in transcriptional
    regulation of P21 in response to DNA damage. Required for FANCD2
    targeting to sites of DNA damage. May function as a
    transcriptional regulator. Mediates E2-dependent ubiquitination.
    Inhibits lipid synthesis by binding to inactive phosphorylated
    ACACA and preventing its dephosphorylation (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex
    (BASC), which contains BRCA1, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, ATM, BLM, PMS2 and
    the RAD50-MRE11-NBN protein complex. This association could be a
    dynamic process changing throughout the cell cycle and within
    subnuclear domains. CTIP interacts specifically with the BRCT
    domains. Interacts with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Interacts
    with SMC1A and COBRA1/NELFB. Binds BRIP1 through the BRCT domains.
    Interacts with ubiquitinated FANCD2. Interacts with BAP1.
    Interacts with DCLRE1C/Artemis and CLSPN. Interacts with histone
    H2AFX and this requires phosphorylation of H2AFX. Interacts with
    CHEK1/CHK1. Interacts with BRCC3. Interacts through its BRCT
    domains with phosphorylated ACACA and prevents its
    dephosphorylation (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Potential).
-!- DOMAIN: The RING-type zinc finger domain interacts with BAP1 (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-1423 in response to IR, UV, and various
    stimuli that cause checkpoint activation (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 BRCT domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RING-type zinc finger.
