Apical endosomal glycoprotein precursor.
"Molecular characterization of an apical early endosomal glycoprotein
from developing rat intestinal epithelial cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably involved in the sorting and selective transport
    of receptors and ligands across polarized epithelia.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Apical endosomal tubules of developing rat
    intestinal epithelial cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 LDL-receptor class A domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 MAM domains.
