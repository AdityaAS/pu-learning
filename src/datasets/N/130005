Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (EC 5.2.1.8) (PPIase A)
(Rotamase A) (Cyclophilin A) (Cyclosporin A-binding protein).
"Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase is the cyclosporin A-binding
protein cyclophilin.";
"Evaluation and characterization of a porcine small intestine cDNA
library: analysis of 839 clones.";
"Cyclophilin and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase are probably
identical proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes
    the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in
    oligopeptides.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Peptidylproline (omega=180) = peptidylproline
    (omega=0).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Binds cyclosporin A (CsA). CsA mediates some of
    its effects via an inhibitory action on PPIase.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyclophilin-type PPIase family. PPIase
    A subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PPIase cyclophilin-type domain.
