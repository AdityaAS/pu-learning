AC   Q1T763;
Centromere protein R (CENP-R) (Nuclear receptor-interacting factor 3).
"The CENP-H-I complex is required for the efficient incorporation of
newly synthesized CENP-A into centromeres.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transcription coregulator that can have both coactivator
    and corepressor functions. Involved in the coactivation of nuclear
    receptors for retinoid X (RXRs) and thyroid hormone (TRs) in a
    ligand-dependent fashion. Probable component of a centromeric
    complex involved in assembly of kinetochore proteins, mitotic
    progression and chromosome segregation (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity). Centromere (By
    similarity). Note=Localizes in the centromeres (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Contains one Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Leu (LXXLL) motif, a motif
    known to be important for the association with nuclear receptors
    (By similarity).
