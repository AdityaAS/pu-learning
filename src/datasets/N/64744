AC   Q74DI7;
Glutamyl-Q tRNA(Asp) synthetase (EC 6.1.1.-) (Glu-Q-RSs).
"Genome of Geobacter sulfurreducens: metal reduction in subsurface
environments.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the tRNA-independent activation of glutamate
    in presence of ATP and the subsequent transfer of glutamate onto a
    tRNA(Asp). Glutamate is transferred on the 2-amino-5-(4,5-
    dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-yl) moiety of the queuosine in the
    wobble position of the QUC anticodon (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family. GluQ subfamily.
 GO:0008270; F:zinc ion binding; IEA:HAMAP.
