Adipokinetic prohormone type 2 precursor [Contains: Adipokinetic
hormone 2 (Adipokinetic hormone II) (AKH-II); Adipokinetic hormone
precursor-related peptide beta chain (APRP-beta) (6 kDa dimeric
peptide B)].
"Molecular cloning of three distinct cDNAs, each encoding a different
adipokinetic hormone precursor, of the migratory locust, Locusta
migratoria. Differential expression of the distinct adipokinetic
hormone precursor genes during flight activity.";
"Primary structures of locust adipokinetic hormones II.";
"Sequence analyses of adipokinetic hormones II from corpora cardiaca
of Schistocerca nitans, Schistocerca gregaria, and Locusta migratoria
by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.";
"Isolation and structure of two novel 6-kDa dimeric peptides from the
corpora cardiaca of the insect Locusta migratoria. Molecular mass
determination by mass spectrometry.";
-!- FUNCTION: This hormone, released from cells in the corpora
    cardiaca after the beginning of flight, causes release of
    diglycerides from the fat body and then stimulates the flight
    muscles to use these diglycerides as an energy source.
-!- SUBUNIT: Adipokinetic hormone precursor-related peptide (APRP) can
    form three type of disulfide-bond dimers: p1 (alpha-alpha), p2
    (alpha-beta), and p3 (beta-beta).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the AKH/HRTH/RPCH family.
