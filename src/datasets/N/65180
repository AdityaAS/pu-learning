-!- FUNCTION: Possible function in spermatogenesis. Enhances the
    degradation of MDM2 and increases the amount of p53 probably by
    modulating the nucleocytoplasmic transport.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with TMPO-Beta, TSG101 and TFDP2. Interacts
    with EMD (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nuclear matrix.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitously expressed at low levels
    throughout development and in adult tissues.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Highest levels in pachytene and diplotene
    stage spermatocytes and primordial germ cells of the male and the
    female.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Its co-expression with the E2F5-TFDP2 transcription
    factor caused a reduction in its transcriptional activity (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 BTB (POZ) domain.
