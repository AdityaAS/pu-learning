-!- FUNCTION: Exact function not known, phosphatase 2A performs an
    essential cellular function.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A phosphoprotein + H(2)O = a protein +
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 iron ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 manganese ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Inactivated in a complex with phosphatase methylesterase
    PPE1 (PP2Ai). Interacts with phosphatase 2A activator RRD2, which
    can reactivate PP2Ai by dissociating the catalytic subunit from
    the complex. Interacts with TAP42.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q12199:TIP41; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-12752, EBI-38123;
    Q12059:ULA1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-12752, EBI-32882;
-!- PTM: Reversibly methyl esterified on Leu-377 by leucine carboxyl
    methyltransferase 1 (PPM1) and protein phosphatase methylesterase
    1 (PPE1). Carboxyl methylation influences the affinity of the
    catalytic subunit for the different regulatory subunits, thereby
    modulating the PP2A holoenzyme's substrate specificity, enzyme
    activity and cellular localization.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 4110 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PPP phosphatase family. PP-2A
    subfamily.
