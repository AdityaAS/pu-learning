AC   P55708;
Putative cysteine synthase (EC 2.5.1.47) (O-acetylserine
sulfhydrylase) (O-acetylserine (Thiol)-lyase) (CSase).
"Molecular basis of symbiosis between Rhizobium and legumes.";
-!- FUNCTION: As it is highly similar to bacterial and plant cysteine
    synthases, it is possible that it catalyzes a related reaction.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3-O-acetyl-L-serine + H(2)S = L-cysteine +
    acetate.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cysteine synthase/cystathionine beta-
    synthase family.
