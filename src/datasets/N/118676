AC   P28683;
Green-sensitive opsin (Green cone photoreceptor pigment).
"Primary structures of chicken cone visual pigments: vertebrate
rhodopsins have evolved out of cone visual pigments.";
"A visual pigment from chicken that resembles rhodopsin: amino acid
sequence, gene structure, and functional expression.";
-!- FUNCTION: Visual pigments are the light-absorbing molecules that
    mediate vision. They consist of an apoprotein, opsin, covalently
    linked to cis-retinal.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Absorption:
      Abs(max)=508 nm;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: The color pigments are found in the cone
    photoreceptor cells.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on some or all of the serine and threonine
    residues present in the C-terminal region.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
    Opsin subfamily.
