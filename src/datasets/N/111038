Melanostatin (Melanotropin release-inhibiting factor) (Neuropeptide Y)
(NPY).
"Characterization of melanotropin-release-inhibiting factor
(melanostatin) from frog brain: homology with human neuropeptide Y.";
-!- FUNCTION: NPY is implicated in the control of feeding and in
    secretion of gonadotrophin-release hormone. NPY may play a
    physiological role in the regulation of pituitary melanotrophs.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NPY family.
Amidation; Direct protein sequencing; Neuropeptide.
