Hepatitis B virus X-interacting protein (HBX-interacting protein) (HBV
X-interacting protein).
"Cloning and characterization of a novel hepatitis B virus x binding
protein that inhibits viral replication.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"HBXIP functions as a cofactor of survivin in apoptosis suppression.";
-!- FUNCTION: When complexed to BIRC5, interferes with apoptosome
    assembly, preventing recruitment of pro-caspase-9 to oligomerized
    APAF1, thereby selectively suppressing apoptosis initiated via the
    mitochondrial/cytochrome c pathway. Down-regulates hepatitis B
    virus (HBV) replication.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with phosphorylated BIRC5; the resulting
    complex binds pro-caspase-9, as well as active caspase-9, but much
    less efficiently. Interacts with hepatitis B virus (HBV)
    oncoprotein HBX C-terminus.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac
    muscle, followed by pancreas, kidney, liver, brain, placenta and
    lung. Elevated levels in both cancerous and non-cancerous liver
    tissue of patients with chronic HBV infection compared with
    hepatic tissue without HBV infection.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Suppression of caspase activation by the
    BIRC5/HBXIP complex is increased in the presence of HBX.
