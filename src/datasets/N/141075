AC   Q9PKU1;
Ribosome-binding factor A.
"Genome sequences of Chlamydia trachomatis MoPn and Chlamydia
pneumoniae AR39.";
-!- FUNCTION: Associates with free 30S ribosomal subunits (but not
    with 30S subunits that are part of 70S ribosomes or polysomes).
    Essential for efficient processing of 16S rRNA. May interact with
    the 5'-terminal helix region of 16S rRNA (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the rbfA family.
Complete proteome; rRNA processing.
