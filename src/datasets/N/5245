(Fragment).
"Homology between a human protein and a protein of the green garden
pea.";
"An ancient conserved gene expressed in the human inner ear:
identification, expression analysis, and chromosomal mapping of human
and mouse antiquitin (ATQ1).";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: An aldehyde + NAD(+) + H(2)O = an acid + NADH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Abundant in kidney, liver, cochlea and outer
    hair cells but not inner hair cells or vestibular type I hair
    cells. Very low levels in lung, brain, intestine and pancreas.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family.
