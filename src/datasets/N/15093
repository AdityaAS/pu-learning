-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the brain, heart, liver, skeletal
    muscle, pancreas and placenta. Isoform 1 is predominant in the
    brain and spinal cord while isoform 4 is more abundant in the
    cerebellum. In the brain, broadly expressed in the amygdala,
    caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, hippocampus, hypothalamus,
    substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus and thalamus.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: The poly-Gln region of ATXN2 is polymorphic: 17 to
    29 repeats in the normal population, expanded to about 36 to 52
    repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) patients.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in ATXN2 are the cause of spinocerebellar ataxia
    2 (SCA2) [MIM:183090]; also known as olivopontocerebellar atrophy
    II (OPCA II or OPCA2). Spinocerebellar ataxia is a clinically and
    genetically heterogeneous group of autosomal dominant cerebellar
    ataxias (ADCA). Patients show progressive incoordination of gait
    and often poor coordination of hands, speech and eye movements.
    Spinocerebellar ataxia is caused by degeneration of the cerebellum
    with variable involvement of the brainstem and spinal cord. Three
    clinical types are distinguished, according to the extent of
    extra-cerebellar signs: cerebellar ataxia with additional features
    like optic atrophy, ophthalmoplegia, bulbar and extrapyramidal
    signs, peripheral neuropathy and dementia, is known as ADCA type
    I; cerebellar ataxia with retinal degeneration and pigmentary
    macular dystrophy is defined as ADCA type II; pure cerebellar
    ataxia without additional signs is classified as ADCA type III.
    SCA2 is clinically classified as ADCA I. It is characterized by
    hyporeflexia, myoclonus and action tremor and dopamine-responsive
    parkinsonism. SCA2 is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the
    coding region of ATXN2. Longer expansions result in earlier onset
    of the disease. In some patients with smaller CAG repeat
    expansions, SCA2 presents as pure familial parkinsonism without
    cerebellar signs.
