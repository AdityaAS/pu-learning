AC   Q4WXH8;
DNA polymerase epsilon, catalytic subunit A (EC 2.7.7.7) (DNA
polymerase II subunit A).
"Genomic sequence of the pathogenic and allergenic filamentous fungus
Aspergillus fumigatus.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA polymerase II participates in chromosomal DNA
    replication (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer. Consists of 4 subunits: pol2, dpb2, dpb3
    and dpb4 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The DNA polymerase activity domain resides in the N-
    terminal half of the protein, while the C-terminus is necessary
    for complexing subunits B and C (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA polymerase type-B family.
