AC   Q06749; Q57292;
Alginate lyase precursor (EC 4.2.2.3) (Poly(beta-D-mannuronate) lyase)
(Poly(mana) alginate lyase).
"Sequence of the algL gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and purification
of its alginate lyase product.";
"Characterization of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa alginate lyase gene
(algL): cloning, sequencing, and expression in Escherichia coli.";
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
-!- FUNCTION: Depolymerizes alginate by cleaving the beta-1,4
    glycosidic bond. May enhance the production of alginate by
    controlling the length of the polymer chain during export.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Eliminative cleavage of polysaccharides
    containing beta-D-mannuronate residues to give oligosaccharides
    with 4-deoxy-alpha-L-erythro-hex-4-enopyranuronosyl groups at
    their ends.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the polysaccharide lyase 5 family.
