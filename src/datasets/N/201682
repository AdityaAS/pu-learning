AC   Q2NKI2; O88880;
Ventral anterior homeobox 1.
"Vax1 is a novel homeobox-containing gene expressed in the developing
anterior ventral forebrain.";
"Expression of the Vax family homeobox genes suggests multiple roles
in eye development.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The homeodomain protein vax1 is required for axon guidance and major
tract formation in the developing forebrain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for axon guidance and major tract formation in
    the developing forebrain. May contribute to the differentiation of
    the neuroretina, pigmented epithelium and optic stalk.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q2NKI2-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q2NKI2-2; Sequence=VSP_019397;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: At 9.5 dpc, expressed in the forebrain,
    through the optic stalk and ending in the proximal portion of the
    optic vesicle. At 10.5 dpc, expressed in the optic stalk, outer
    layer of the optic cup, and the primordium of the pigment
    epithelium. In the pigment epithelium, down-regulated after 11.5
    dpc, and expression restricted to the optic stalk and the ventral
    forebrain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the EMX homeobox family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 homeobox DNA-binding domain.
