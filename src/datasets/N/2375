AC   Q7NAZ6;
Acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1) (Acetokinase).
"The complete genome sequence of the avian pathogen Mycoplasma
gallisepticum strain R(low).";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + acetate = ADP + acetyl phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + propanoate = ADP + propanoyl phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; acetyl-CoA
    biosynthesis; acetyl-CoA from acetate: step 1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acetokinase family.
