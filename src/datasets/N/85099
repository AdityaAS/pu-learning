-!- FUNCTION: Integrin alpha-PS1/beta-PS is a receptor for laminin.
    Integrin alpha-PS2/beta-PS is a receptor for Tig (Tiggrin). Also
    binds to wb (wing blister) and Ten-m (Tenascin major). Required
    for many embryonic (dorsal closure and somatic muscle attachments)
    and post-embryonic developmental processes (attachment between
    cell layers of imaginal disks, organization of ommatidial arrays
    and flight muscle development). Involved in the function and/or
    development of the olfactory system.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta subunit. Beta-PS
    associates with either alpha-PS1, alpha-PS2 or alpha-PS3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Embryonic dorsal cuticle, larval eye and wing
    imaginal disk.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The absence of the beta-PS subunit results in
    detachment and rounding up of the muscles, thus the gene encoding
    beta-PS is called myospheroid.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the integrin beta chain family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 VWFA domain.
