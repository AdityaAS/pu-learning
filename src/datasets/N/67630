Gramicidin S synthetase 2 (Gramicidin S synthetase II) [Includes: ATP-
dependent proline adenylase (ProA) (Proline activase); ATP-dependent
valine adenylase (ValA) (Valine activase); ATP-dependent ornithine
adenylase (OrnA) (Ornithine activase); ATP-dependent leucine adenylase
(LeuA) (Leucine activase)].
"Four homologous domains in the primary structure of GrsB are related
to domains in a superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes.";
"Gramicidin S biosynthesis operon containing the structural genes grsA
and grsB has an open reading frame encoding a protein homologous to
fatty acid thioesterases.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is a multifunctional enzyme, able to
    activate and polymerize the amino acids Pro, Val, Orn and Leu.
    Activation sites for these AA consist of individual domains.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 4 phosphopantetheines covalently.
-!- PATHWAY: Antibiotic biosynthesis; gramicidin S biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Large multienzyme complex of grsA and grsB.
-!- DOMAIN: Consists of four modules, and harbors a putative
    thioesterase domain at its C-terminal end. Each module
    incorporates one amino acid into the peptide product and can be
    further subdivided into domains responsible for substrate
    adenylation, thiolation, condensation (not for the initiation
    module), and epimerization (optional), and N methylation
    (optional).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATP-dependent AMP-binding enzyme
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 acyl carrier domains.
Antibiotic biosynthesis; Hydrolase; Ligase; Multifunctional enzyme;
Phosphopantetheine; Repeat.
