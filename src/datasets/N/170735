AC   Q5HAD9; Q5FDL4;
Protein-export protein secB.
"The genome of the heartwater agent Ehrlichia ruminantium contains
multiple tandem repeats of actively variable copy number.";
"Comparative genomic analysis of three strains of Ehrlichia
ruminantium reveals an active process of genome size plasticity.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the proteins required for the normal
    export of envelope proteins out of the cell cytoplasm. It is a
    molecular chaperone that binds to a subset of precursor proteins,
    thereby preventing them from aggregating (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer. Interacts with secA. Part of the
    prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus which comprise secA,
    secB, secD, secE, secF, secG and secY (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the secB family.
