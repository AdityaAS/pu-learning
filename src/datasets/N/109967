-!- FUNCTION: NCS has antibiotic activity (for Gram-positive bacteria)
    and antitumor activity (for certain mouse tumors). NCS binds non-
    covalently to a chromophore which is the cytotoxic and mutagenic
    component of the antibiotic. The chromophore binds to DNA as a
    weak intercalator and causes single- and double-strand breaks.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the neocarzinostatin family.
