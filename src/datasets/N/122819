AC   Q93TL5;
Phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (EC 1.3.7.5).
"Functional genomic analysis of the HY2 family of ferredoxin-dependent
bilin reductases from oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.";
"Genome divergence in two Prochlorococcus ecotypes reflects oceanic
niche differentiation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the four-electron reduction of biliverdin IX-
    alpha (2-electron reduction at both the A and D rings); the
    reaction proceeds via an isolatable 2-electron intermediate,
    181,182-dihydrobiliverdin.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (3Z)-phycocyanobilin + oxidized ferredoxin =
    biliverdin IX-alpha + reduced ferredoxin.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HY2 family.
