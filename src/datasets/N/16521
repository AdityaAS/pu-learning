AC   Q07947;
Benzene 1,2-dioxygenase system ferredoxin subunit.
"The Pseudomonas putida ML2 plasmid-encoded genes for benzene
dioxygenase are unusual in codon usage and low in G+C content.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein seems to be a 2Fe-2S ferredoxin.
-!- PATHWAY: Aromatic compound metabolism; benzene degradation;
    catechol from benzene: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: This dioxygenase system consists of four proteins: the
    two subunits of the hydroxylase component (bedC1 and bedC2), a
    ferredoxin (bedB) and a ferredoxin reductase (bedA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial ring-hydroxylating
    dioxygenase ferredoxin component family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Rieske domain.
