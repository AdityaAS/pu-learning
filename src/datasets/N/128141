Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase pme-3 (EC 3.2.1.143) (Poly ADP-ribose
metabolism enzyme 3).
"Characterization of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolases in the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Poly(ADP-ribose) synthesized after DNA damage is only
    present transiently and is rapidly degraded by poly(ADP-ribose)
    glycohydrolase. Poly(ADP-ribose) metabolism may be required for
    maintenance of the normal function of neuronal cells (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolyzes poly(ADP-ribose) at glycosidic
    (1''-2') linkage of ribose-ribose bond to produce free ADP-ribose.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=a; Synonyms=long;
      IsoId=Q867X0-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=b; Synonyms=short;
      IsoId=Q867X0-2; Sequence=VSP_051616, VSP_051617;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase family.
