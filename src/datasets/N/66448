AC   Q5HLI0;
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (EC 5.4.2.1)
(Phosphoglyceromutase) (PGAM) (BPG-dependent PGAM) (dPGM).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate and
    3-phosphoglycerate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-phospho-D-glycerate + 2,3-diphosphoglycerate
    = 3-phospho-D-glycerate + 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-phospho-D-glycerate = 3-phospho-D-glycerate.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; pyruvate from D-
    glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate: step 3.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphoglycerate mutase family. BPG-
    dependent PGAM subfamily.
 GO:0046538; F:2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent phosphogl...; IEA:HAMAP.
