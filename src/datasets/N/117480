Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 2 (ODC antizyme, long form) (ODC-Az-
L).
"Two zebrafish (Danio rerio) antizymes with different expression and
activities.";
-!- FUNCTION: Exhibits ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitory
    activity but does not accelerate ODC degradation in vitro.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed ubiquitously in 24 hour embryos,
    with highest levels in telencephalon, lens, retina, cerebellum and
    hindbrain primordia.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed in both embryos and adults.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: A ribosomal frameshift occurs between the codons
    for Ser-60 and Asp-61. An autoregulatory mechanism enables
    modulation of frameshifting according to the cellular
    concentration of polyamines.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ODC antizyme family.
Ribosomal frameshift.
