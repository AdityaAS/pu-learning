AC   Q8YFK1;
Phosphoribosylamine--glycine ligase (EC 6.3.4.13) (GARS) (Glycinamide
ribonucleotide synthetase) (Phosphoribosylglycinamide synthetase).
"The genome sequence of the facultative intracellular pathogen
Brucella melitensis.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 5-phospho-D-ribosylamine + glycine = ADP
    + phosphate + 1-N-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)glycinamide.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; IMP biosynthesis; 1-N-(5-
    phospho-D-ribosyl)glycinamide from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-
    diphosphate: step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Purine biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GARS family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ATP-grasp domain.
