-!- FUNCTION: Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate
    monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an
    NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety
    of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty
    acids, and xenobiotics.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (6Z,8E,10E,14Z)-(5S,12R)-5,12-dihydroxyicosa-
    6,8,10,14-tetraenoate + NADPH + O(2) = (6Z,8E,10E,14Z)-(5S,12R)-
    5,12,20-trihydroxyicosa-6,8,10,14-tetraenoate + NADP(+) + H(2)O.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; peripheral membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family.
