"Structure and organization of Marchantia polymorpha chloroplast
genome. III. Gene organization of the large single copy region from
rbcL to trnI(CAU).";
"Chloroplast gene organization deduced from complete sequence of
liverwort Marchantia polymorpha chloroplast DNA.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly to 16S rRNA central domain where it helps coordinate
    assembly of the platform of the 30S subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S8P family.
