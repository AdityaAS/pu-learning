-!- FUNCTION: Putative taste receptor which may play a role in the
    perception of bitterness.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Low levels in tongue, stomach and duodenum.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Several bitter taste receptors are expressed in a
    single taste receptor cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor T2R family.
