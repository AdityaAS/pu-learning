AC   Q2KTN9;
Arginyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.19) (Arginine--tRNA ligase) (ArgRS).
"Comparison of the genome sequence of the poultry pathogen Bordetella
avium with those of B. bronchiseptica, B. pertussis, and B.
parapertussis reveals extensive diversity in surface structures
associated with host interaction.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-arginine + tRNA(Arg) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-arginyl-tRNA(Arg).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Ligase;
