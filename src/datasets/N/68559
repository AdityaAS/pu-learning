AC   Q9V0I6;
GMP synthase [glutamine-hydrolyzing] subunit A (EC 6.3.5.2) (Glutamine
amidotransferase).
"An integrated analysis of the genome of the hyperthermophilic
archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the synthesis of GMP from XMP (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + xanthosine 5'-phosphate + L-glutamine +
    H(2)O = AMP + diphosphate + GMP + L-glutamate.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; GMP biosynthesis; GMP from XMP
    (glutamine route): single step [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer composed of a glutamine amidotransferase
    subunit (A) and a GMP-binding subunit (B) (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 glutamine amidotransferase type-1 domain.
Complete proteome; Glutamine amidotransferase; GMP biosynthesis;
