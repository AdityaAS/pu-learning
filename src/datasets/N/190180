Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A precursor (p60)
(TNF-R1) (TNF-RI) (TNFR-I) (p55).
"Cloning and sequencing of cDNA encoding bovine tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-receptor I.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for TNFSF2/TNF-alpha and homotrimeric
    TNFSF1/lymphotoxin-alpha. The adapter molecule FADD recruits
    caspase-8 to the activated receptor. The resulting death-inducing
    signaling complex (DISC) performs caspase-8 proteolytic activation
    which initiates the subsequent cascade of caspases (aspartate-
    specific cysteine proteases) mediating apoptosis (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Binding of TNF to the extracellular domain leads to
    homotrimerization. The aggregated death domains provide a novel
    molecular interface that interacts specifically with the death
    domain of TRADD. Various TRADD-interacting proteins such as TRAFS,
    RIPK1 and possibly FADD, are recruited to the complex by their
    association with TRADD. This complex activates at least two
    distinct signaling cascades, apoptosis and NF-kappa-B signaling.
    Interacts with BAG4, BRE, GRB2, SQSTM1 and TRPC4AP (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- DOMAIN: Both the cytoplasmic membrane-proximal region and the C-
    terminal region containing the death domain are involved in the
    interaction with TRPC4AP (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 death domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 TNFR-Cys repeats.
