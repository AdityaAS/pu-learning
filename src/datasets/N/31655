AC   O18963; Q4PS78;
Cytochrome P450 2E1 (EC 1.14.14.1) (CYPIIE1).
"Isolation of a full length cytochrome P450 (CYP2E) cDNA sequence and
its functional expression in V79 cells.";
"Comparative mapping of the bovine SPRN locus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate
    monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an
    NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety
    of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty
    acids, and xenobiotics.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: RH + reduced flavoprotein + O(2) = ROH +
    oxidized flavoprotein + H(2)O.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; peripheral membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family.
