AC   Q5HP79;
3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.19) (5-
enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) (EPSP synthase) (EPSPS).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphoenolpyruvate + 3-phosphoshikimate =
    phosphate + 5-O-(1-carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshikimate.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; chorismate
    biosynthesis; chorismate from D-erythrose 4-phosphate and PEP:
    step 6.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Aromatic amino acids biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the EPSP synthase family.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis;
