-!- FUNCTION: Binds the telomeric double-stranded TTAGGG repeat.
    Protects against end-to-end fusion of chromosomes and plays a role
    in successful progression through the cell division cycle.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Binds to RAP1. Interacts with NBN.
-!- INTERACTION:

    Q14191:WRN; NbExp=4; IntAct=EBI-706637, EBI-368417;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Note=Colocalizes with telomeric DNA
    in interphase cells and is located at chromosome ends during
    metaphase.
