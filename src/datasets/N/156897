AC   Q7N3W0;
Ribonuclease T (EC 3.1.13.-) (Exoribonuclease T) (RNase T).
"The genome sequence of the entomopathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus
luminescens.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the end-turnover of tRNA: specifically
    removes the terminal AMP residue from uncharged tRNA (tRNA-C-C-A).
    Also appears to be involved in tRNA biosynthesis (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNase T family.
