methyltransferase).
"Antibiotic resistance as a stress response: complete sequencing of a
large number of chromosomal loci in Staphylococcus aureus strain COL
that impact on the expression of resistance to methicillin.";
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of 7-N-methylguanine at position
    46 (m7G46) in tRNA (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA = S-adenosyl-L-
    homocysteine + tRNA containing 7-N-methylguanine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily. TrmB
    family.
