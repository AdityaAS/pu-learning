Squalene monooxygenase (EC 1.14.99.7) (Squalene epoxidase) (SE).
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
"Molecular biological characterization of an azole-resistant Candida
glabrata isolate.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the first oxygenation step in sterol
    biosynthesis and is suggested to be one of the rate-limiting
    enzymes in this pathway.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Squalene + AH(2) + O(2) = (S)-squalene-2,3-
    epoxide + A + H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: FAD.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Microsome; microsomal membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the squalene monooxygenase family.
