Nudix hydrolase 4 (EC 3.6.1.-) (AtNUDT4) (ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase)
(EC 3.6.1.13) (NADH pyrophosphatase) (EC 3.6.1.22).

-!- FUNCTION: Probably mediates the hydrolysis of some nucleoside
    diphosphate derivatives. In vitro, it can use both NADH and ADP-
    ribose as substrates; however the relevance of such substrates in
    vivo is unclear.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ADP-ribose + H(2)O = AMP + D-ribose 5-
    phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NAD(+) + H(2)O = AMP + NMN.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium or manganese (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in roots, stems and leaves.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Nudix hydrolase family.
