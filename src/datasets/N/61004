AC   Q88P64;
Glycine cleavage system H protein 1.
"Complete genome sequence and comparative analysis of the
metabolically versatile Pseudomonas putida KT2440.";
-!- FUNCTION: The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the degradation of
    glycine. The H protein shuttles the methylamine group of glycine
    from the P protein to the T protein (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 lipoyl cofactor covalently (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The glycine cleavage system is composed of four proteins:
    P, T, L and H (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gcvH family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 lipoyl-binding domain.
 GO:0019464; P:glycine decarboxylation via glycine cleavag...; IEA:HAMAP.
