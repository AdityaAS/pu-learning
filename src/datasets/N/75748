AC   P71119;
Heme oxygenase (EC 1.14.99.3).
"Utilization of host iron sources by Corynebacterium diphtheriae:
identification of a gene whose product is homologous to eukaryotic
heme oxygenases and is required for acquisition of iron from heme and
hemoglobin.";
"The complete genome sequence and analysis of Corynebacterium
diphtheriae NCTC13129.";
-!- FUNCTION: Allows the bacteria to use the host heme as an iron
    source. Involved in the oxidation of heme and subsequent release
    of iron from the heme moiety.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Heme + 3 AH(2) + 3 O(2) = biliverdin + Fe(2+)
    + CO + 3 A + 3 H(2)O.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the heme oxygenase family.
