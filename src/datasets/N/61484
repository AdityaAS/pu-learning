AC   Q2PQH8;
Glycogen debranching enzyme (Glycogen debrancher) [Includes: 4-alpha-
glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.25) (Oligo-1,4-1,4-glucantransferase);
Amylo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.33) (Amylo-1,6-glucosidase)
(Dextrin 6-alpha-D-glucosidase)].
"Glycogen storage disease type IIIa in curly coated retrievers.";
-!- FUNCTION: Multifunctional enzyme acting as 1,4-alpha-D-glucan:1,4-
    alpha-D-glucan 4-alpha-D-glycosyltransferase and amylo-1,6-
    glucosidase in glycogen degradation (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Transfers a segment of a 1,4-alpha-D-glucan to
    a new position in an acceptor, which may be glucose or a 1,4-
    alpha-D-glucan.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of (1->6)-alpha-D-glucosidic branch
    linkages in glycogen phosphorylase limit dextrin.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycogen debranching enzyme family.
