AC   Q6AAD6;
4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (EC 2.7.1.148) (CMK)
(4-(cytidine-5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase).
"The complete genome sequence of Propionibacterium acnes, a commensal
of human skin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the phosphorylation of the position 2 hydroxy
    group of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-
    erythritol = ADP + 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-
    D-erythritol.
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; isopentenyl-PP biosynthesis via
    DXP pathway; isopentenyl-PP from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:
    step 3.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GHMP kinase family. IspE subfamily.
ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Isoprene biosynthesis; Kinase;
Nucleotide-binding; Transferase.
