AC   O57811;
Fibrillarin-like rRNA/tRNA 2'-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.-).
"Complete sequence and gene organization of the genome of a hyper-
thermophilic archaebacterium, Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3.";
"A structural approach to gene function and structure quality for
Pyrococcus horikoshii fibrillarin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in pre-rRNA and tRNA processing. Utilizes the
    methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine to catalyze the site-specific
    2'-hydroxyl methylation of ribose moieties in rRNA and tRNA. Site
    specificity is provided by a guide RNA that base pairs with the
    substrate. Methylation occurs at a characteristic distance from
    the sequence involved in base pairing with the guide RNA (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with nop5. Component of box C/D small
    ribonucleoprotein (sRNP) particles that contain rpl7ae, flpA and
    nop5, plus a guide RNA (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fibrillarin family.
