cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-alpha regulatory subunit.
"Human testis cDNA for the regulatory subunit RII alpha of cAMP-
dependent protein kinase encodes an alternate amino-terminal region.";
"Molecular cloning, upstream sequence and promoter studies of the
human gene for the regulatory subunit RII alpha of cAMP-dependent
protein kinase.";
"Phosphoproteomic analysis of the human pituitary.";
-!- FUNCTION: Type II regulatory chains mediate membrane association
    by binding to anchoring proteins, including the MAP2 kinase.
-!- SUBUNIT: The inactive form of the enzyme is composed of two
    regulatory chains and two catalytic chains. Activation by cAMP
    produces two active catalytic monomers and a regulatory dimer that
    binds four cAMP molecules. Interacts with AKAP4.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Four types of regulatory chains are found: I-
    alpha, I-beta, II-alpha, and II-beta. Their expression varies
    among tissues and is in some cases constitutive and in others
    inducible.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by the activated catalytic chain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cAMP-dependent kinase regulatory chain
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 cyclic nucleotide-binding domains.
