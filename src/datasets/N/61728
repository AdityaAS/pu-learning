AC   P97785;
GDNF family receptor alpha-1 precursor (GFR-alpha-1) (GDNF receptor
alpha) (GDNFR-alpha) (TGF-beta-related neurotrophic factor receptor
1).
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for GDNF. Mediates the GDNF-induced
    autophosphorylation and activation of the RET receptor (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: 2 molecules of GDNFR-alpha are thought to form a complex
    with the disulfide-linked GDNF dimer and with 2 molecules of RET
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; GPI-anchor (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GDNFR family.
