AC   Q63484;
RAC-gamma serine/threonine-protein kinase (EC 2.7.11.1) (RAC-PK-gamma)
(Protein kinase Akt-3) (Protein kinase B, gamma) (PKB gamma).
"Genome sequence of the Brown Norway rat yields insights into
mammalian evolution.";
"Molecular cloning and characterization of a new member of the RAC
protein kinase family: association of the pleckstrin homology domain
of three types of RAC protein kinase with protein kinase C subspecies
and beta gamma subunits of G proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: IGF-1 leads to the activation of AKT3, which may play a
    role in regulating cell survival. Capable of phosphorylating
    several known proteins (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Two specific sites, one in the kinase domain
    (Thr-305) and the other in the C-terminal regulatory region (Ser-
    472), need to be phosphorylated for its full activation (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Binding of the PH domain to the phosphatidylinositol 3-
    kinase alpha (PI(3)K) results in its targeting to the plasma
    membrane.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on threonine and serine residues.
    Phosphorylation on both sites is required for full activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. RAC
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PH domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
