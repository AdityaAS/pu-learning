AC   P31835;
Cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase precursor (EC 2.4.1.19)
(Cyclodextrin-glycosyltransferase) (CGTase).
"Polypeptide possessing cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase
activity.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cyclizes part of a 1,4-alpha-D-glucan chain by
    formation of a 1,4-alpha-D-glucosidic bond.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 calcium ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- DOMAIN: May consist of two protein domains: the one in the N-
    terminal side cleaves the alpha-1,4-glucosidic bond in starch, and
    the other in the C-terminal side catalyzes other activities,
    including the reconstitution of an alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkage
    for cyclizing the maltooligosaccharide produced.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 13 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CBM20 (carbohydrate binding type-20)
    domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 IPT/TIG domain.
