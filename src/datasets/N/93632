AC   Q2T1K6;
Lipoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.-) (Lipoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]-protein-
N-lipoyltransferase) (Lipoate-protein ligase B).
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the transfer of the endogenously synthesized
    lipoate to apoproteins, creating an amide linkage that joins the
    free carboxyl group of lipoic acid to the epsilon-amino group of a
    specific lysine residue in lipoate-dependent enzymes. Utilizes
    lipoyl-acyl-carrier-protein as a source of lipoyl groups, although
    octanoyl groups from octanoyl-ACP can also be transferred to the
    lipoyl domain of apoproteins (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Lipoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + apo-protein =
    holo-protein + acyl-carrier-protein.
-!- PATHWAY: Endogenous lipoate metabolism; lipoylation step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lipB family.
