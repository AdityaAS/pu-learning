Photosystem II reaction center protein T (PSII-T).
"Utility of 17 chloroplast genes for inferring the phylogeny of the
basal angiosperms.";
"The tortoise and the hare II: relative utility of 21 noncoding
chloroplast DNA sequences for phylogenetic analysis.";
"Complete chloroplast genome sequences of Drimys, Liriodendron, and
Piper: implications for the phylogeny of magnoliids.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to play a role in the dimerization of PSII (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; single-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the psbT family.
