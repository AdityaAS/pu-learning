AC   Q9WVE9; Q9WVE1;
Intersectin-1 (EH domain and SH3 domain regulator of endocytosis 1).
"EHSH1/intersectin, a protein that contains EH and SH3 domains and
binds to dynamin and SNAP-25. A protein connection between exocytosis
and endocytosis?";
-!- FUNCTION: Adapter protein that may provide indirect link between
    the endocytic membrane traffic and the actin assembly machinery.
    May regulate the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with dynamin, CDC42, SNAP25 and SNAP23.
    Clusters several dynamin in a manner that is regulated by
    alternative splicing. Also binds clathrin-associated proteins and
    other components of the endocytic machinery, such as SPIN90,
    EPS15, EPN1, EPN2 and STN2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Intracytoplasmic membrane. Synaptosome.
    Note=Enriched in synaptosomes.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
      Comment=Additional isoforms seem to exist;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q9WVE9-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q9WVE9-2; Sequence=VSP_004297;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in brain.
-!- DOMAIN: SH3-3, SH3-4 and SH3-5, but not SH3-1 and SH3-2 domains,
    bind to dynamin.
-!- DOMAIN: The KLERQ domain binds to SNAP-25 and SNAP-23.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 EF-hand domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 EH domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 SH3 domains.
