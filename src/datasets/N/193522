AC   P21689;
Anthranilate synthase component 1 (EC 4.1.3.27) (Anthranilate synthase
component I).
"Molecular characterization and expression analysis of the
anthranilate synthase gene of Pseudomonas syringae subsp.
savastanoi.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Chorismate + L-glutamine = anthranilate +
    pyruvate + L-glutamate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-tryptophan biosynthesis; L-
    tryptophan from chorismate: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two components I and two components II (By
    similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Component I catalyzes the formation of anthranilate
    using ammonia rather than glutamine, whereas component II provides
    glutamine amidotransferase activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the anthranilate synthase component I
    family.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis; Lyase;
Tryptophan biosynthesis.
