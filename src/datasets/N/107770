AC   Q3SYU9;
Major vault protein (MVP).
-!- FUNCTION: Required for normal vault structure. Vaults are multi-
    subunit structures that may act as scaffolds for proteins involved
    in signal transduction. Vaults may also play a role in nucleo-
    cytoplasmic transport. Down-regulates INFG-mediated STAT1
    signaling and subsequent activation of JAK. Down-regulates SRC
    activity and signaling through MAP kinases (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Major component of the vault ribonucleoprotein particle,
    at least composed of MVP, PARP4 and one or more vault RNAs
    (vRNAs). Interacts with TEP1. Interacts with PTEN and activated
    MAPK1. The phosphorylated protein interacts with the SH2 domains
    of PTPN11 and SRC (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: MVP 3 mediates interaction with PTEN (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: MVP 4 mediates interaction with PARP4 (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on Tyr residues after EGF stimulation (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: Dephosphorylated by PTPN11 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 8 MVP (vault) repeats.
