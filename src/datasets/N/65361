AC   P18873;
Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(o) subunit alpha 2.
"Alternative splicing produces transcripts encoding two forms of the
alpha subunit of GTP-binding protein Go.";
-!- FUNCTION: Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are
    involved as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane
    signaling systems. The G(o) protein function is not clear.
-!- SUBUNIT: G proteins are composed of 3 units; alpha, beta and
    gamma. The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding
    site.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Alpha-2;
      IsoId=P18873-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Alpha-1;
      IsoId=P18872-1; Sequence=External;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-alpha family. G(i/o/t/z) subfamily.
