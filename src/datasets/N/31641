Cytochrome P450 2D10 (EC 1.14.14.1) (CYPIID10) (P450-DB5) (P450-CMF1B)
(Debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase).

site.";
"Four species of cDNAs for cytochrome P450 isozymes immunorelated to

-!- FUNCTION: Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate
    monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an
    NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety
    of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty
    acids, and xenobiotics.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: RH + reduced flavoprotein + O(2) = ROH +
    oxidized flavoprotein + H(2)O.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; peripheral membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: P450 can be induced to high levels in liver and other
    tissues by various foreign compounds, including drugs, pesticides,
    and carcinogens.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family.
