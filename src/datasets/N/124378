"Isolation and characterization of porcine cationic eosinophil granule
proteins.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Donor + H(2)O(2) = oxidized donor + 2 H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion per heterodimer (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 heme B (iron-protoporphyrin IX) group covalently
    per heterodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two light chains and two heavy chains (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic granule. Note=Cytoplasmic
    granules of eosinophils.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peroxidase family. XPO subfamily.
