AC   O58885;
Xaa-Pro dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.9) (X-Pro dipeptidase) (Proline
dipeptidase) (Prolidase) (Imidodipeptidase).
"Complete sequence and gene organization of the genome of a hyper-
thermophilic archaebacterium, Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3.";
-!- FUNCTION: Splits dipeptides with a prolyl or hydroxyprolyl residue
    in the C-terminal position and nonpolar amino acid at the N-
    terminal position (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of Xaa-|-Pro dipeptides; also acts
    on aminoacyl-hydroxyproline analogs. No action on Pro-|-Pro.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 manganese ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M24B family.
