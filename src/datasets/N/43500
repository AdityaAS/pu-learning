DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 3 (DnaJ protein homolog 3) (Heat shock
J3 protein) (HSJ-3) (MSJ-1).
"MSJ-1, a new member of the DNAJ family of proteins, is a male germ
cell-specific gene product.";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: May operate as a co-chaperone of the male germ cell- and
    haploid stage-specific Hsp70 proteins.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Testis specific. Expression is confined to the
    germ line without any contribution of the somatic components.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Its expression occurs in the postmeiotic
    phase of male germ cell development. First detected in 30 days old
    mice and thereafter into adulthood. Barely detectable in 20 days
    old mice and absent before this period.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 J domain.
Chaperone.
