AC   O27372;
DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit L (EC 2.7.7.6).
"Complete genome sequence of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum
deltaH: functional analysis and comparative genomics.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription
    of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as
    substrates.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the archaeal rpoL/eukaryotic RPB11/RPC19
    RNA polymerase subunit family.
 GO:0006351; P:transcription, DNA-dependent; IEA:HAMAP.
Complete proteome; DNA-directed RNA polymerase;
