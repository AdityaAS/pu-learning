-!- FUNCTION: CBF binds to the core site, 5'-PYGPYGGT-3', of a number
    of enhancers and promoters, including murine leukemia virus,
    polyomavirus enhancer, T-cell receptor enhancers, LCK, IL-3 and
    GM-CSF promoters. The alpha subunit binds DNA and appears to have
    a role in the development of normal hematopoiesis. Isoform AML-1L
    interferes with the transactivation activity of RUNX1. Acts
    synergistically with ELF4 to transactivate the IL-3 promoter and
    with ELF2 to transactivate the mouse BLK promoter. Inhibits MYST4-
    dependent transcriptional activation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer with CBFB. RUNX1 binds DNA as a monomer and
    through the Runt domain. DNA-binding is increased by
    heterodimerization. Isoform AML-1L can neither bind DNA nor
    heterodimerize. Interacts with TLE1 and THOC4. Interacts with
    ELF1, ELF2 and SPI1. Interacts via its Runt domain with the ELF4
    N-terminal region. Interaction with ELF2 isoform 2 (NERF-1a) may
    act to repress RUNX1-mediated transactivation. Interacts with
    MYST3 and MYST4.

    develop acute myelogenous leukemia.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Runt domain.
-!- CAUTION: The fusion of AML1 with EAP in T-MDS induces a change of
    reading frame in the latter resulting in 17 AA unrelated to those
    of EAP.
