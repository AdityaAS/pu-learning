-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of dTDP-glucose, from dTTP and
    glucose 1-phosphate, as well as its pyrophosphorolysis.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: dTTP + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate =
    diphosphate + dTDP-glucose.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (Probable).
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=20.5 uM for dTTP;
      KM=34 uM for glucose 1-phosphate;
      KM=95 uM for dTDP-glucose;
      KM=154 uM for PPi;
      Vmax=194 umol/min/mg enzyme for the forward reaction;
      Vmax=360 umol/min/mg enzyme for the reverse reaction;
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 8.0-8.5. Active from pH 6.0 to 10.0;
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate biosynthesis; dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Lipopolysaccharide O-antigen biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Both catalyzed reactions, i.e. dTDP-glucose
    biosynthesis and pyrophosphorolysis, follow a sequential ordered
    bi-bi catalytic mechanism.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glucose-1-phosphate
    thymidylyltransferase family.
-!- CAUTION: Most extant K-12 lines do not express O-antigen because
    of mutations in dTDP-rhamnose biosynthetic genes or in the
    rhamnosyltransferase gene wbbL.
