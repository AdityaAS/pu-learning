AC   Q6HDK5;
Heat-inducible transcription repressor hrcA.
"Pathogenomic sequence analysis of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus
thuringiensis isolates closely related to Bacillus anthracis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Negative regulator of class I heat shock genes (grpE-
    dnaK-dnaJ and groELS operons). Prevents heat-shock induction of
    these operons (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hrcA family.
