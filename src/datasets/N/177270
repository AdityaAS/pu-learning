-!- FUNCTION: Involved in intracellular signal transduction mediated
    by cytokines and growth factors. Upon IL-2 and GM-CSL stimulation,
    it plays a role in signaling leading to DNA synthesis and c-myc
    induction. May also play a role in endocytic trafficking as well
    as in T-cell development.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer. Composed of STAM1 and HGS/HRS. Also
    interacts directly with STAMBP/AMSH.
-!- INTERACTION:
    O95630:STAMBP; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-752333, EBI-396676;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q92783-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q92783-2; Sequence=VSP_014846, VSP_014847;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitously expressed.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on Tyr-197. Phosphorylation occurs in response
    to IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-7, GM-CSF, EGF and PDGF.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the STAM family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ITAM domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SH3 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 UIM (ubiquitin-interacting motif) repeat.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 VHS domain.
