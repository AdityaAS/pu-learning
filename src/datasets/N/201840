Deubiquitinating protein VCIP135 (EC 3.4.22.-) (Valosin-containing
protein p97/p47 complex-interacting protein p135) (Valosin-containing
protein p97/p47 complex-interacting protein 1).
"VCIP135, a novel essential factor for p97/p47-mediated membrane
fusion, is required for Golgi and ER assembly in vivo.";
"VCIP135 acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme during p97-p47-mediated
reassembly of mitotic Golgi fragments.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme. Necessary for VCP-
    mediated reassembly of Golgi stacks after mitosis. May play a role
    in VCP-mediated formation of transitional endoplasmic reticulum
    (tER). Mediates dissociation of the ternary complex containing
    STX5A, NSFL1C and VCP.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds VCP and the ternary complex containing STX5A,
    NSFL1C and VCP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum. Golgi apparatus;
    Golgi stack. Note=Associated with Golgi stacks and endoplasmic
    reticulum.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 OTU domain.
