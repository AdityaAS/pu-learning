AC   P0A5U5; O34519; P26345;
Protein recA (Recombinase A) [Contains: Endonuclease PI-MboI
(EC 3.1.-.-) (Mbo recA intein)].
"The complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium bovis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Can catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of
    single-stranded DNA, the ATP-dependent uptake of single-stranded
    DNA by duplex DNA, and the ATP-dependent hybridization of
    homologous single-stranded DNAs. It interacts with lexA causing
    its activation and leading to its autocatalytic cleavage (By
    similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: PI-MboI is an endonuclease (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- PTM: This protein undergoes a protein self splicing that involves
    a post-translational excision of the intervening region (intein)
    followed by peptide ligation (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the recA family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DOD-type homing endonuclease domain.
