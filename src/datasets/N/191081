AC   P42637;
Tropomyosin 1 (TMI) (Polypeptide 49).
"Schistosoma mansoni tropomyosin: cDNA characterization, sequence,
expression, and gene product localization.";
-!- FUNCTION: Tropomyosin, in association with the troponin complex,
    plays a central role in the calcium dependent regulation of muscle
    contraction.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed at much higher levels in the adult
    worm stage as compared to the cercariae and the egg stages.
-!- DOMAIN: The molecule is in a coiled coil structure that is formed
    by 2 polypeptide chains. The sequence exhibits a prominent seven-
    residues periodicity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tropomyosin family.
Coiled coil; Repeat.
