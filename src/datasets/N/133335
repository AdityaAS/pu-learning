AC   P28075;
Proteasome subunit beta type 5 precursor (EC 3.4.25.1) (Proteasome
epsilon chain) (Macropain epsilon chain) (Multicatalytic endopeptidase
complex epsilon chain) (Proteasome subunit X) (Proteasome chain 6).
"N-terminal sequence similarities between components of the
multicatalytic proteinase complex.";
-!- FUNCTION: The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex
    which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg,
    Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or
    slightly basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic
    activity.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cleavage of peptide bonds with very broad
    specificity.
-!- SUBUNIT: The proteasome is composed of at least 15 non identical
    subunits which form a highly ordered ring-shaped structure. This
    subunit can be displaced by the equivalent immune-specific subunit
    PSMB8. Directly interacts with POMP (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase T1B family.
