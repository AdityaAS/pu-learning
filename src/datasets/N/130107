Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-like 1 (EC 5.2.1.8) (PPIase)
(Rotamase).
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes
    the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in
    oligopeptides. May be involved in pre-mRNA splicing (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Peptidylproline (omega=180) = peptidylproline
    (omega=0).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by Cyclosporin A (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Identified in the spliceosome C complex, at least
    composed of AQR, ASCC3L1, C19orf29, CDC40, CDC5L, CRNKL1, DDX23,
    DDX41, DDX48, DDX5, DGCR14, DHX35, DHX38, DHX8, EFTUD2, FRG1,

    PRPF6, PRPF8, RALY, RBM22, RBM8A, RBMX, SART1, SF3A1, SF3A2,
    SF3A3, SF3B1, SF3B2, SF3B3, SFRS1, SKIV2L2, SNRPA1, SNRPB, SNRPB2,
    SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF, SNRPG, SNW1, SRRM1, SRRM2,
    SYF2, SYNCRIP, TFIP11, THOC4, U2AF1, WDR57, XAB2 and ZCCHC8 (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyclophilin-type PPIase family. PPIL1
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PPIase cyclophilin-type domain.
