AC   Q8CRH4;
30S ribosomal protein S8.
"Genome-based analysis of virulence genes in a non-biofilm-forming
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (ATCC 12228).";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly to 16S rRNA central domain where it helps coordinate
    assembly of the platform of the 30S subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts proteins S5
    and S12 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S8P family.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
