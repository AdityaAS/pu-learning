AC   Q6GHJ9;
UPF0122 protein SAR1212.
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: Not known. Could take part in the signal recognition
    particle (SRP) pathway. This is inferred due to the conservation
    of its genetic proximity to ftsY/ffh. May be a regulatory protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UPF0122 family.
 GO:0003674; F:molecular_function; IEA:HAMAP.
