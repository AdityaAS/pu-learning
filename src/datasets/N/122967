(Fragment).
"Differential CNS expression of alternative mRNA isoforms of the
mammalian genes encoding cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases.";
"Molecular cloning of rat homologues of the Drosophila melanogaster
dunce cAMP phosphodiesterase: evidence for a family of genes.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate + H(2)O =
    adenosine 5'-phosphate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by rolipram.
-!- PATHWAY: Cyclic nucleotide metabolism.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase
    family.
cAMP; Hydrolase.
