AC   Q8ZBM5;
Deoxyguanosinetriphosphate triphosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.5.1) (dGTPase)
(dGTP triphosphohydrolase).
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague.";
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis KIM.";
"Complete genome sequence of Yersinia pestis strain 91001, an isolate
avirulent to humans.";
-!- FUNCTION: dGTPase preferentially hydrolyzes dGTP over the other
    canonical NTPs (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: dGTP + H(2)O = deoxyguanosine + triphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dGTPase family. Type 1 subfamily.
Complete proteome; Hydrolase; Magnesium.
