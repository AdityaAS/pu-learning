AC   Q983E4;
Putative arginyl-tRNA--protein transferase (EC 2.3.2.8) (R-
transferase) (Arginyltransferase).
"Complete genome structure of the nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacterium
Mesorhizobium loti.";
-!- FUNCTION: May conjugate Arg from its aminoacyl-tRNA to the N-
    termini of proteins containing an N-terminal aspartate or
    glutamate (Potential).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-arginyl-tRNA + protein = tRNA + L-arginyl-
    protein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the R-transferase family.
