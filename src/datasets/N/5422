AC   P23240; Q9KTS0;
Aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3).
"Expression of the Vibrio cholerae gene encoding aldehyde
dehydrogenase is under control of ToxR, the cholera toxin
transcriptional activator.";
"A Vibrio cholerae pathogenicity island associated with epidemic and
pandemic strains.";
"Comparison of Vibrio cholerae pathogenicity islands in sixth and
seventh pandemic strains.";
"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in V.cholerae virulence, as its
    expression is under the control of toxR, a transcriptional
    activator of several genes associated with virulence.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: An aldehyde + NAD(+) + H(2)O = an acid + NADH.
-!- PATHWAY: Ethanol utilization; second step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family.
