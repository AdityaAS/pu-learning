AC   Q2YDH6;
AP-3 complex subunit sigma-1 (Adapter-related protein complex 3 sigma-
1 subunit) (Sigma-adaptin 3a) (AP-3 complex sigma-3A subunit) (Sigma-
3A-adaptin).
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the AP-3 complex, an adapter-related complex
    which is not clathrin-associated. The complex is associated with
    the Golgi region as well as more peripheral structures. It
    facilitates the budding of vesicles from the Golgi membrane and
    may be directly involved in trafficking to lysosomes (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) is an heterotetramer
    composed of two large adaptins (delta/AP3D1 and beta3A/AP3B2 or
    beta3B/AP3B1), a medium adaptin (mu3A/AP3M1 or mu3B/AP3M2) and a
    small adaptin (sigma3A/AP3S1 or sigma3B/AP3S2). Interacts with
    CENTG2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus. Cytoplasmic vesicle;
    cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; peripheral membrane protein;
    cytoplasmic side (By similarity). Note=Component of the coat
    surrounding the cytoplasmic face of coated vesicles located at the
    Golgi complex (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adaptor complexes small subunit family.
