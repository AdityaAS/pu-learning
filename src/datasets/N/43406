AC   P03264;
Early E2A DNA-binding protein.
"Nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding adenovirus type 2 DNA
binding protein.";
"The sequence of the 3' non-coding region of the hexon mRNA discloses
a novel adenovirus gene.";
"Phosphorylation of adenovirus DNA-binding protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds cooperatively single-stranded DNA in a sequence-
    independent manner. Involved in DNA-replication, regulation of
    mRNA formation, and host-range specificity. Zinc is required for
    DNA binding.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Note=Accumulates in infected cells.
