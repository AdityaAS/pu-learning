Neprilysin (EC 3.4.24.11) (Neutral endopeptidase) (NEP)
(Enkephalinase) (Neutral endopeptidase 24.11) (Atriopeptidase) (CD10
antigen).
"Amino acid sequence of rabbit kidney neutral endopeptidase 24.11
(enkephalinase) deduced from a complementary DNA.";
"An antibody purified with a lambda GT11 fusion protein precipitates
enkephalinase activity.";
"Exploration of the catalytic site of endopeptidase 24.11 by site-
directed mutagenesis. Histidine residues 583 and 587 are essential for
catalysis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Thermolysin-like specificity, but is almost confined on
    acting on polypeptides of up to 30 amino acids. Biologically
    important in the destruction of opioid peptides such as Met- and
    Leu-enkephalins by cleavage of a Gly-Phe bond. Involved in the
    degradation of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Preferential cleavage of polypeptides between
    hydrophobic residues, particularly with Phe or Tyr at P1'.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M13 family.
