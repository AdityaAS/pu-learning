AC   Q6MU20;
50S ribosomal protein L20.
"The genome sequence of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC type
strain PG1T, the causative agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
(CBPP).";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds directly to 23S ribosomal RNA and is necessary for
    the in vitro assembly process of the 50S ribosomal subunit. It is
    not involved in the protein synthesizing functions of that subunit
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L20P family.
