"Functional significance and evolutionary development of the 5'-
terminal regions of immunoglobulin variable-region genes.";
"The variability, arrangement, and rearrangement of immunoglobulin
genes.";
"Sequence of the full-length immunoglobulin kappa-chain of mouse
myeloma MPC 11.";
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The mature chain has 12 additional residues at its
    amino end, due to a tandem duplication of 36 nucleotides after the
    codon for residue 36. Residue 42 corresponds to the N-terminal
    residue of typical kappa chains.
