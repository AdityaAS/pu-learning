AC   Q5NF19;
Probable inorganic polyphosphate/ATP-NAD kinase (EC 2.7.1.23)
(Poly(P)/ATP NAD kinase).
"The complete genome sequence of Francisella tularensis, the causative
agent of tularemia.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the phosphorylation of NAD to NADP. Utilizes
    ATP and other nucleoside triphosphates as well as inorganic
    polyphosphate as a source of phosphorus (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + NAD(+) = ADP + NADP(+).
-!- COFACTOR: Divalent metal ions (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NAD kinase family.
