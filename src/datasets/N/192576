AC   Q926U7;
tRNA modification GTPase trmE.
"Comparative genomics of Listeria species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Exhibits a very high intrinsic GTPase hydrolysis rate.
    Involved in the biosynthesis of the hypermodified nucleoside 5-
    methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, which is found in the wobble
    position of some tRNAs (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the era/trmE GTP-binding protein family.
    TrmE subfamily.
Complete proteome; GTP-binding; Nucleotide-binding; tRNA processing.
