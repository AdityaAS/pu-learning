Nitrile hydratase subunit beta (EC 4.2.1.84) (Nitrilase) (NHase).
"Purification, cloning, and primary structure of a new enantiomer-
selective amidase from a Rhodococcus strain: structural evidence for a
conserved genetic coupling with nitrile hydratase.";
-!- FUNCTION: NHase catalyzes the hydration of various nitrile
    compounds to the corresponding amides.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: An aliphatic amide = a nitrile + H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta chain.
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Industrial production of acrylamide is now being
    developed using some of these enzymes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nitrile hydratase subunit beta family.
Lyase.
