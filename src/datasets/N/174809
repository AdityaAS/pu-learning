AC   P15501;
Prostatic spermine-binding protein precursor (SBP) (Major prostatic
secretory glycoprotein) (P25).
"Androgen regulated expression of a spermine binding protein gene in
mouse ventral prostate.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein seems to be functional equivalent to rat
    prostatic spermine-binding protein, which is involved in polyamine
    binding.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Prostate.
-!- INDUCTION: By androgens.
-!- SIMILARITY: To rat SBP.
