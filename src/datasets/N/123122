AC   Q9EP73;
Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 precursor (Programmed death ligand 1)
(PD-L1) (PDCD1 ligand 1) (B7 homolog 1) (B7-H1) (CD274 antigen).
"Engagement of the PD-1 immunoinhibitory receptor by a novel B7-family
member leads to negative regulation of lymphocyte activation.";
"B7-H1 costimulation preferentially enhances CD28-independent T-helper
cell function.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"PD-L2 is a second ligand for PD-1 and inhibits T cell activation.";
"Molecular modeling and functional mapping of B7-H1 and B7-DC uncouple
costimulatory function from PD-1 interaction.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the costimulatory signal, essential for T
    lymphocyte proliferation and production of IL10 and IFNG, in an
    IL2-dependent and a PDCD1-independent manner. Interaction with
    PDCD1 inhibit T-cell proliferation and cytokine production.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PDCD1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in the heart, thymus,
    skeletal muscle, and lung. Weakly expressed in the kidney, spleen,
    thyroid, and liver. Expressed on activated dendritic cells, B
    cells and macrophages. Expressed in numerous tumor cells lines of
    lymphoid origin.
-!- INDUCTION: Up-regulated by IFNG treatment in monocytes. Up-
    regulated on dendritic cells, B-cells and macrophages after
    activation by LPS and INFG.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. BTN/MOG
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like V-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
