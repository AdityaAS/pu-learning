AC   Q9S219;
Probable inorganic polyphosphate/ATP-NAD kinase 2 (EC 2.7.1.23)
(Poly(P)/ATP NAD kinase 2).
"Complete genome sequence of the model actinomycete Streptomyces
coelicolor A3(2).";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the phosphorylation of NAD to NADP. Utilizes
    ATP and other nucleoside triphosphates as well as inorganic
    polyphosphate as a source of phosphorus (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + NAD(+) = ADP + NADP(+).
-!- COFACTOR: Divalent metal ions (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NAD kinase family.
 GO:0046872; F:metal ion binding; IEA:HAMAP.
