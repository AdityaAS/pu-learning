AC   Q28985;
Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 precursor (IGFBP-5) (IBP-
5) (IGF-binding protein 5).
"Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the porcine insulin-like
growth factor binding protein-5 complementary deoxyribonucleic acid.";
-!- FUNCTION: IGF-binding proteins prolong the half-life of the IGFs
    and have been shown to either inhibit or stimulate the growth
    promoting effects of the IGFs on cell culture. They alter the
    interaction of IGFs with their cell surface receptors.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 IGFBP domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 thyroglobulin type-1 domain.
Growth factor binding; Signal.
