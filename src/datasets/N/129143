AC   P05896;
Pol polyprotein [Contains: Protease (Retropepsin) (EC 3.4.23.-);
Reverse transcriptase/ribonuclease H (EC 2.7.7.49) (EC 3.1.26.4) (RT);
Integrase (IN)].
"Sequence of simian immunodeficiency virus from macaque and its
relationship to other human and simian retroviruses.";
-!- FUNCTION: During replicative cycle of retroviruses, the reverse-
    transcribed viral DNA is integrated into the host chromosome by
    the viral integrase enzyme. RNase H activity is associated with
    the reverse transcriptase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage to 5'-
    phosphomonoester.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
-!- PTM: Cleavage sites that yield the mature proteins remain to be
    determined.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This is a macaque isolate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the retroviral Pol polyprotein family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 integrase catalytic domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 integrase-type DNA-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 integrase-type zinc finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase A2 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 reverse transcriptase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RNase H domain.
