Casein kinase I isoform delta (EC 2.7.11.1) (Protein kinase 20).
"Developmental timing in C. elegans is regulated by kin-20 and tim-1,
homologs of core circadian clock genes.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Casein kinases are operationally defined by their
    preferential utilization of acidic proteins such as caseins as
    substrates. It can phosphorylate a large number of proteins.
    Participates in Wnt signaling (By similarity). Is a developmental
    timer that specifies temporal cell fate selection; acts to control
    the temporal identity of hypodermal seam cells. Required during
    late-larval development to prevent adult fates, particularly cell
    cycle exit and fusion, from being expressed too early.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Exhibits substrate-dependent heparin activation
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
