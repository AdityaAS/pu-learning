AC   O34328;
Guanylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.8) (GMP kinase).
"A 28 kbp segment from the spoVM region of the Bacillus subtilis 168
genome.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential for recycling GMP and indirectly, cGMP (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + GMP = ADP + GDP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the guanylate kinase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 guanylate kinase-like domain.
