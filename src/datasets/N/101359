AC   Q9DGE2;
Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14a (EC 2.7.11.24) (Mitogen-activated
protein kinase p38a) (MAP kinase p38a) (zp38a).
"Asymmetric p38 activation in zebrafish: its possible role in
symmetric and synchronous cleavage.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responds to activation by environmental stress and
    cytokines by phosphorylating downstream targets. Required for
    cytokinesis on the future dorsal side of the blastodisc,
    suggesting a role in symmetrical and synchronous blastomere
    cleavage.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by threonine and tyrosine
    phosphorylation by the dual specificity kinase, MKK3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed as the predominant form of mapk14
    both maternally and zygotically throughout development.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. MAP
    kinase subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
