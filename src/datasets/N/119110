AC   Q9WUV0; Q3TMI6;
Origin recognition complex subunit 5.
"Identification and characterization of MmORC4 and MmORC5, two
subunits of the mouse origin of replication recognition complex.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the origin recognition complex (ORC) that
    binds origins of replication. It has a role in both chromosomal
    replication and mating type transcriptional silencing. Binds to
    the ARS consensus sequence (ACS) of origins of replication in an
    ATP-dependent manner.
-!- SUBUNIT: ORC is composed of six subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ORC5 family.
