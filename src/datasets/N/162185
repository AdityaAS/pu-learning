AC   Q5XA27;
30S ribosomal protein S14.
"Progress toward characterization of the group A Streptococcus
metagenome: complete genome sequence of a macrolide-resistant serotype
M6 strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds 16S rRNA, required for the assembly of 30S
    particles and may also be responsible for determining the
    conformation of the 16S rRNA at the A site (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts proteins S3
    and S10 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S14P family.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
