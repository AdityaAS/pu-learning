97 kDa heat shock protein (Egg sperm receptor).
"Sea urchin egg receptor for sperm: sequence similarity of binding
domain and hsp70.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cell surface recognition protein that binds acrosome-
    reacted sperm and thereby mediates binding and subsequent fusion
    of the sperm and egg.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) thought to have a N-terminal
    sequence signal and a C-terminal transmembrane region. Both
    domains do not exist in the revised sequence.
ATP-binding; Direct protein sequencing; Nucleotide-binding.
