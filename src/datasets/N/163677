AC   P14128;
30S ribosomal protein S1 (Fragment).
"Comparative studies on the structural gene for the ribosomal protein
S1 in ten bacterial species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds mRNA; thus facilitating recognition of the
    initiation point. It is needed to translate mRNA with a short
    Shine-Dalgarno (SD) purine-rich sequence (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S1P family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains at least 5 S1 motif domains.
Repeat; Ribonucleoprotein; Ribosomal protein; RNA-binding.
