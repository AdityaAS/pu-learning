DNA-directed RNA polymerase alpha chain (EC 2.7.7.6) (PEP) (Plastid-
encoded RNA polymerase subunit alpha) (RNA polymerase subunit alpha).
"The chloroplast genome of Nymphaea alba: whole-genome analyses and
the problem of identifying the most basal angiosperm.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription
    of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as
    substrates.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: In plastids the minimal PEP RNA polymerase catalytic core
    is composed of four subunits: alpha, beta, beta', and beta''. When
    a (nuclear-encoded) sigma factor is associated with the core the
    holoenzyme is formed, which can initiate transcription (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal domain is essential for RNAP assembly and
    basal transcription, whereas the C-terminal domain is involved in
    interaction with transcriptional regulators and with upstream
    promoter elements (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA polymerase alpha chain family.
