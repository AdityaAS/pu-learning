AC   Q9K8I7;
Molybdopterin-converting factor subunit 2 (MPT synthase subunit 2)
(Molybdopterin synthase subunit 2) (Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis
protein E) (Molybdopterin-converting factor large subunit).
"Complete genome sequence of the alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus
halodurans and genomic sequence comparison with Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Converts molybdopterin precursor Z into molybdopterin.
    This requires the incorporation of two sulfur atoms into precursor
    Z to generate a dithiolene group (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; molybdopterin biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of 2 moaD subunits and 2 moaE subunits (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the moaE family.
Complete proteome; Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis.
