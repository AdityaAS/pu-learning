AC   P57633;
DNA mismatch repair protein mutL.
"Genome sequence of the endocellular bacterial symbiont of aphids
Buchnera sp. APS.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is involved in the repair of mismatches in
    DNA. It is required for dam-dependent methyl-directed DNA mismatch
    repair. May act as a "molecular matchmaker", a protein that
    promotes the formation of a stable complex between two or more
    DNA-binding proteins in an ATP-dependent manner without itself
    being part of a final effector complex (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA mismatch repair mutL/hexB family.
Complete proteome; DNA damage; DNA repair.
