AC   Q9HM85; P14823;
Elongation factor 2 (EF-2).
"Sequence analysis of the peptide-elongation factor EF-2 gene,
downstream from those of ribosomal proteins H-S12 and H-S7, from the
archaebacterial extreme halophile, Halobacterium halobium.";
"Genome sequence of Halobacterium species NRC-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein promotes the GTP-dependent translocation of
    the nascent protein chain from the A-site to the P-site of the
    ribosome.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GTP-binding elongation factor family.
    EF-G/EF-2 subfamily.
