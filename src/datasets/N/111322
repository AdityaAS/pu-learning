AC   Q5BKC9;
Ephexin-1 (Eph-interacting exchange protein) (Neuronal guanine
nucleotide exchange factor).
"Genome sequence of the Brown Norway rat yields insights into
mammalian evolution.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"EphA receptors regulate growth cone dynamics through the novel
guanine nucleotide exchange factor ephexin.";
"Eph-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of ephexin1 modulates growth
cone collapse.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which
    differentially activates the GTPases RHOA, RAC1 and CDC42. Plays a
    role in axon guidance regulating ephrin-induced growth cone
    collapse. Upon activation by ephrin through EPHA4, the GEF
    activity switches toward RHOA resulting in its activation.
    Activated RHOA promotes cone retraction at the expense of RAC1-
    and CDC42-stimulated growth cone extension.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with EPHA4.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Membrane. Note=Associated with
    membranes. Localizes to axonal growth cones.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in telencephalic neurons (at protein
    level). Expressed in brain, spinal cord and testis.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: First detected at E15. Expression increases
    gradually throughout embryonic development and peaks at postnatal
    day 10. Expressed at E17 in the eye and the deep layers of the
    cortex. At postnatal day 6, expression is restricted to retinal
    glanglion cell layer in the eye.
-!- DOMAIN: The DH domain and the PH domain are both required to
    mediate interaction with EPHA4 (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Src-dependent phosphorylation at Tyr-172 upon EPHA4
    activation increases the guanine exchange factor activity toward
    RHOA.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DH (DBL-homology) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PH domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SH3 domain.
