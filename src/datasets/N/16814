AC   Q8ISB6;
Beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein 2 precursor (BGBP-2) (Beta-1,3-glucan
recognition protein 2) (BetaGRP-2).
"Beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein-2 (betaGRP-2) from Manduca sexta:
an acute-phase protein that binds beta-1,3-glucan and lipoteichoic
acid to aggregate fungi and bacteria and stimulate prophenoloxidase
activation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the recognition of invading micro-organisms.
    Binds specifically to beta-1,3-glucan and lipoteichoic acid and
    causes aggregation of invading micro-organisms. Binding to beta-
    1,3-glucan activates the phenoloxidase cascade.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Cuticle and fat body.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expression levels are low during larval
    feeding stages and increase dramatically at the start of the
    wandering stage.
-!- INDUCTION: By bacterial and yeast infection.
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=54920; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=19-482;
    NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the insect beta-1,3-glucan binding protein
    family.
