AC   Q4WS57; Q6MYA1;
Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (EC 2.1.1.-) (Protein phosphatase
methyltransferase 1).
"Insight into the genome of Aspergillus fumigatus: analysis of a 922
kb region encompassing the nitrate assimilation gene cluster.";
"Genomic sequence of the pathogenic and allergenic filamentous fungus
Aspergillus fumigatus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Methylates the carboxyl group of the C-terminal leucine
    residue of protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunits to form
    alpha-leucine ester residues (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily. LCMT
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
