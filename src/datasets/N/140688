AC   P38545;
GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran (GTPase Ran) (Ras-like protein TC4).
"Cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding the homologue of Ran/TC4
GTP-binding protein from Plasmodium falciparum.";
"Cloning and characterisation of a Plasmodium falciparum homologue of
the Ran/TC4 signal transducing GTPase involved in cell cycle
control.";
-!- FUNCTION: GTP-binding protein involved in nucleocytoplasmic
    transport. Required for the import of protein into the nucleus and
    also for RNA export. Involved in chromatin condensation and
    control of cell cycle (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small GTPase superfamily. Ran family.
