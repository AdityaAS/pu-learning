transferase) (SAT) (ATP-sulfurylase small subunit).
"Comparative analyses of the complete genome sequences of Pierce's
disease and citrus variegated chlorosis strains of Xylella
fastidiosa.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + sulfate = diphosphate + adenylyl
    sulfate.
-!- PATHWAY: Sulfur metabolism; hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis; sulfite
    from sulfate: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer composed of cysD, the smaller subunit, and
    cysN (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PAPS reductase family. CysD subfamily.
