-!- FUNCTION: AS-C proteins are involved in the determination of the
    neuronal precursors in the peripheral nervous system and the
    central nervous system.
-!- SUBUNIT: Efficient DNA binding requires dimerization with another
    bHLH protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: L(1)SC, SC and AC strongly label the
    presumptive stomatogastric nervous system, while ASE is more
    prominent in the presumptive procephalic lobe.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain.
