-!- FUNCTION: The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the degradation of
    glycine. The H protein shuttles the methylamine group of glycine
    from the P protein to the T protein.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 lipoyl cofactor covalently.
-!- SUBUNIT: The glycine cleavage system is composed of four proteins:
    P, T, L and H.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in GCSH are a cause of non-ketotic
    hyperglycinemia (NKH) [MIM:605899]; also known as glycine
    encephalopathy (GCE). NKH is an autosomal recessive disease
    characterized by accumulation of a large amount of glycine in body
    fluid and by severe neurological symptoms.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gcvH family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 lipoyl-binding domain.
