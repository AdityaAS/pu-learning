-!- FUNCTION: Troponin is the central regulatory protein of striated
    muscle contraction. Tn consists of three components: Tn-I which is
    the inhibitor of actomyosin ATPase, Tn-T which contains the
    binding site for tropomyosin and Tn-C. The binding of calcium to
    Tn-C abolishes the inhibitory action of Tn on actin filaments.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P02643:TNNI2; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1026870, EBI-1026877;
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Skeletal muscle troponin C binds four calcium ions.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the troponin C family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 EF-hand domains.
