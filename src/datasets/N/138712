-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the ATP-dependent amination of UTP to CTP with
    either L-glutamine or ammonia as the source of nitrogen.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + UTP + NH(3) = ADP + phosphate + CTP.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; CTP biosynthesis; CTP from UDP:
    step 2 [final step].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CTP synthase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 glutamine amidotransferase type-1 domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
