associated protein).

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The novel angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-associated protein
ATRAP downregulates AT1R and ameliorates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.";
-!- FUNCTION: Appears to be a negative regulator of type-1 angiotensin
    II receptor-mediated signaling by regulating receptor
    internalisation as well as mechanism of receptor desensitization
    such as phosphorylation. Induces also a decrease in angiotensin
    II-stimulated transcriptional activity. May play a role of
    negative regulator in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by
    angiotensin II through an inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated
    protein kinase pathway.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with GNB2L1/RACK1 (By similarity), and with the
    C-terminal region of AGTR1.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P29754:Agtr1; NbExp=4; IntAct=EBI-645964, EBI-765178;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity). Golgi
    apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity). Cytoplasmic vesicle; cytoplasmic vesicle
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
    Note=Present in perinuclear vesicular membranes, Endoplasmic
    reticulum, Golgi and endocytic vesicles (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous but more abundant in kidney, testis
    and heart.
