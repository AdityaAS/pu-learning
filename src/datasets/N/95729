Acyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.2.1.50).
"Cloning and nucleotide sequences of lux genes and characterization of
luciferase of Xenorhabdus luminescens from a human wound.";
"Multiple repetitive elements and organization of the lux operons of
luminescent terrestrial bacteria.";
-!- FUNCTION: LuxC is the fatty acid reductase enzyme responsible for
    synthesis of the aldehyde substrate for the luminescent reaction
    catalyzed by luciferase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A long-chain aldehyde + CoA + NADP(+) = a
    long-chain acyl-CoA + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Bioluminescent fatty acid reduction system; third step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the luxC family.
