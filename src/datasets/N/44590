AC   Q9HH84;
DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7) [Contains: Endonuclease PI-TspGE8I
(EC 3.1.-.-) (Tsp-GE8 pol-1 intein); Endonuclease PI-TspGE8II
(EC 3.1.-.-) (Tsp-GE8 pol-2 intein)].
"Thermococcales taxonomy and phylogeny based on the comparative use of
16S rDNA, 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer and family B DNA polymerase
genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: In addition to polymerase activity, this DNA polymerase
    exhibits 3' to 5' exonuclease activity (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: PI-TspGE8I and PI-TspGE8II are endonucleases
    (Potential).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
-!- PTM: This protein undergoes a protein self splicing that involves
    a post-translational excision of the intervening region (intein)
    followed by peptide ligation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA polymerase type-B family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 DOD-type homing endonuclease domains.
