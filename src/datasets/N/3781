AC   O35227;
ADAM 7 precursor (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 7).
"ADAM7, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) gene
family is specifically expressed in the mouse anterior pituitary and
epididymis.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play an important role in male reproduction
    including sperm maturation and gonadotrope function. This is a non
    catalytic metalloprotease-like protein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the apical region of the proximal
    caput epididymal epithelium and in the anterior pituitary,
    specifically, in the gonadotrophes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 disintegrin domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase M12B domain.
