"Vibrio fischeri Lux operon SalI digest.";
"Nucleotide sequence of the regulatory locus controlling expression of
bacterial genes for bioluminescence.";
"Nucleotide sequence of the luxR and luxI genes and structure of the
primary regulatory region of the lux regulon of Vibrio fischeri ATCC
7744.";
-!- FUNCTION: LuxC is the fatty acid reductase enzyme responsible for
    synthesis of the aldehyde substrate for the luminescent reaction
    catalyzed by luciferase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A long-chain aldehyde + CoA + NADP(+) = a
    long-chain acyl-CoA + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Bioluminescent fatty acid reduction system; third step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the luxC family.
