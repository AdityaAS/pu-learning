Activated RNA polymerase II transcriptional coactivator p15 precursor
(SUB1 homolog) (Positive cofactor 4) (PC4) (p14).
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";

specifically expressed in embryo as well as in a chemically induced
pancreatic B cell tumor of rat.";
-!- FUNCTION: General coactivator that functions cooperatively with
    TAFs and mediates functional interactions between upstream
    activators and the general transcriptional machinery. May be
    involved in stabilizing the multiprotein transcription complex.
    Binds single-stranded DNA. Also binds, in vitro, nonspecifically
    to double-stranded DNA (ds DNA) (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with CSTF2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- PTM: Proteolysis is required for p9 DNA-binding activity (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: Activity of p15 is controlled by protein kinases that target
    the regulatory domain. Phosphorylation inactivates both ds DNA-
    binding and cofactor function (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transcriptional coactivator PC4 family.
