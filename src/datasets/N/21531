AC   P60889;
Chromobox protein homolog 7.
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in maintaining the transcriptionally repressive
    state of genes. Modifies chromatin, rendering it heritably changed
    in its expressibility. Regulator of cellular lifespan by
    maintaining the repression of CDKN2A, but not by inducing
    telomerase activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the chromatin-associated polycomb complex
    (PcG). Interacts with RING1, but not with BMI1, EED or EZH2 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 chromo domain.
