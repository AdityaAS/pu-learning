Hypothetical sugar kinase ydeV.
"A 570-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 28.0-40.1 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Identification of a novel Bcl-2 related gene, BRAG-1, in human
glioma.";
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FGGY kinase family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.4) thought to be a human sequence and
    was called by them BRAG1 (brain-related apoptosis gene 1 = BRAG-1)
    with a role in apoptosis. The DNA sequence of the region they
    sequenced is more than 99% identical to that of this E.coli gene.
    Furthermore they claim 'extensive similarity to the Bcl-2 family
    of genes.' such a similarity is not significant and this protein
    is much more likely to be a sugar kinase.
