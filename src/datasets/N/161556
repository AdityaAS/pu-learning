AC   Q492A9;
30S ribosomal protein S12.
"Genome sequence of Blochmannia pennsylvanicus indicates parallel
evolutionary trends among bacterial mutualists of insects.";
-!- FUNCTION: With S4 and S5 plays an important role in translational
    accuracy (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: Interacts with and stabilizes bases of the 16S rRNA that
    are involved in tRNA selection in the A site and with the mRNA
    backbone. Located at the interface of the 30S and 50S subunits, it
    traverses the body of the 30S subunit contacting proteins on the
    other side and probably holding the rRNA structure together. The
    combined cluster of proteins S8, S12 and S17 appears to hold
    together the shoulder and platform of the 30S subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts proteins S8
    and S17. May interact with IF1 in the 30S initiation complex (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S12P family.
