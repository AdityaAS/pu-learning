AC   P03364;
Pol polyprotein [Contains: Reverse transcriptase/ribonuclease H
(EC 2.7.7.49) (EC 3.1.26.4) (RT); Integrase (IN)].
"Molecular cloning, complete nucleotide sequence, and gene structure
of the provirus genome of a retrovirus produced in a human
lymphoblastoid cell line.";
"Major pol gene progenitors in the evolution of oncoviruses.";
-!- FUNCTION: During replicative cycle of retroviruses, the reverse-
    transcribed viral DNA is integrated into the host chromosome by
    the viral integrase enzyme. RNase H activity is associated with
    the reverse transcriptase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
-!- PTM: Specific enzymatic cleavages in vivo yield mature proteins.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the retroviral Pol polyprotein family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 integrase catalytic domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 integrase-type DNA-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 integrase-type zinc finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 reverse transcriptase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RNase H domain.
