AC   O35185; P97289;
Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 2 (bHLHB2) (Stimulated by
retinoic acid gene 13 protein) (E47 interaction protein 1) (eipl).
"Overexpression of Stra13, a novel retinoic acid-inducible gene of the
basic helix-loop-helix family, inhibits mesodermal and promotes
neuronal differentiation of P19 cells.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: May function as a transcriptional factor for neuronal
    differentiation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2I/UBC9
    (By similarity). Able to homodimerize or heterodimerize with
    TCF3/E47.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed from E9.5 day to E17.5 day in the
    ventricular layer of the brain and spinal cord, but also in the
    retinal pigment epithelium, developing eyelids, nasal epithelium,
    serous gland, vibrissae, epithelium of the mouth cavity and the
    tooth buds. Highly expressed in the heart, thymus and adrenal
    glands followed by lung, liver parenchyma, kidney tubules,
    epithelium of the esophagus and stomach. From E15.5 to E17.5 it is
    expressed in urinary bladder and urethra. From E17.5, it is
    expressed in developing muscle.
-!- INDUCTION: Stimulated by retinoic acid (RA).
-!- PTM: Ubiquitinated; which may lead to proteasomal degradation (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Orange domain.
