Methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein tlpA.
"Cloning and characterization of genes encoding methyl-accepting
chemotaxis proteins in Bacillus subtilis.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Chemotactic-signal transducers respond to changes in the
    concentration of attractants and repellents in the environment,
    transduce a signal from the outside to the inside of the cell, and
    facilitate sensory adaptation through the variation of the level
    of methylation. All amino acids serve as attractants in
    B.subtilis, they appear to cause an increase in the turnover
    methyl groups, leading to methylation of an unidentified acceptor,
    while repellents have been shown to cause a decrease in methyl
    group turnover. The methyl groups are added by a methyltransferase
    and removed by a methylesterase.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HAMP domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 methyl-accepting transducer domain.
