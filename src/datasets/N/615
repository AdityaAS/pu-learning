AC   P31687;
4-coumarate--CoA ligase 2 (EC 6.2.1.12) (4CL 2) (4-coumaroyl-CoA
synthase 2) (Clone 4CL16).
"Molecular cloning and expression of 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase, an
enzyme involved in the resistance response of soybean (Glycine max L.)
against pathogen attack.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 4-coumarate + CoA = AMP + diphosphate +
    4-coumaroyl-CoA.
-!- PATHWAY: Secondary metabolite metabolism; stilbene, coumarine and
    lignin biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATP-dependent AMP-binding enzyme
    family.
 GO:0016207; F:4-coumarate-CoA ligase activity; IEA:EC.
