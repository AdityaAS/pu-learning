"Identification of candidate residues for interaction of protein S
with C4b binding protein and activated protein C.";
-!- FUNCTION: Anticoagulant plasma protein; it is a cofactor to
    activated protein C in the degradation of coagulation factors Va
    and VIIIa. It helps to prevent coagulation and stimulating
    fibrinolysis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Plasma.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 EGF-like domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Gla (gamma-carboxy-glutamate) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 laminin G-like domains.
