AC   Q3AEB5;
Holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase (EC 2.7.8.7) (Holo-ACP synthase)
(4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase acpS).
"Life in hot carbon monoxide: the complete genome sequence of
Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z-2901.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transfers the 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety from coenzyme
    A to a Ser of acyl-carrier-protein (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CoA-(4'-phosphopantetheine) + apo-[acyl-
    carrier-protein] = adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + holo-[acyl-
    carrier-protein].
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the P-Pant transferase superfamily. AcpS
    family.
