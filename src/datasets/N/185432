AC   P40904;
Tubulin beta-2 chain (Beta-2 tubulin).
"Isolation, characterization, and expression of a second beta-tubulin-
encoding gene from Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp.
aeschynomene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules. It
    binds two moles of GTP, one at an exchangeable site on the beta
    chain and one at a non-exchangeable site on the alpha-chain.
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer of alpha and beta chains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tubulin family.
Antibiotic resistance; GTP-binding; Microtubule; Nucleotide-binding.
