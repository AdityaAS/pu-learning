AMP deaminase 2 (EC 3.5.4.6) (AMP deaminase isoform L) (Fragment).
"Adenylate deaminase. A multigene family in humans and rats.";
-!- FUNCTION: AMP deaminase plays a critical role in energy
    metabolism.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: AMP + H(2)O = IMP + NH(3).
-!- PATHWAY: Purine nucleotide cycle.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Three isoforms are present in mammals: AMP
    deaminase 1 is the predominant form in skeletal muscle; AMP
    deaminase 2 predominates in smooth muscle, non-muscle tissue,
    embryonic muscle and undifferentiated myoblasts; AMP deaminase 3
    is found in erythrocytes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adenosine and AMP deaminases family.
 GO:0003876; F:AMP deaminase activity; IEA:EC.
