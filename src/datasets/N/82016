AC   Q97X13;
Putative ketol-acid reductoisomerase 3 (EC 1.1.1.86) (Acetohydroxy-
acid isomeroreductase 3) (Alpha-keto-beta-hydroxylacil
reductoisomerase 3).
"The complete genome of the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P2.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate + NADP(+)
    = (S)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-oxobutanoate + NADPH.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (2R,3R)-2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylpentanoate +
    NADP(+) = (S)-2-hydroxy-2-ethyl-3-oxobutanoate + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-isoleucine biosynthesis; L-
    isoleucine from 2-oxobutanoate: step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-valine biosynthesis; L-valine
    from pyruvate: step 2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ketol-acid reductoisomerase family.
-!- CAUTION: Ser-107 is present instead of the conserved His which is
    expected to be an active site residue.
