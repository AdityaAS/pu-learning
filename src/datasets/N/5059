AC   O88884; O88980;
A kinase anchor protein 1, mitochondrial precursor (Protein kinase A-
anchoring protein 1) (PRKA1) (A-kinase anchor protein 121 kDa) (AKAP
121) (Dual specificity A-kinase-anchoring protein 1) (D-AKAP-1)
(Spermatid A-kinase anchor protein 84) (S-AKAP84).
"Expression of a kinase anchor protein 121 is regulated by hormones in
thyroid and testicular germ cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to type I and II regulatory subunits of protein
    kinase A and anchors them to the cytoplasmic face of the
    mitochondrial outer membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane
    (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1; Synonyms=AKAP121;
      IsoId=O88884-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2; Synonyms=S-AKAP84;
      IsoId=O88884-2; Sequence=VSP_002854, VSP_002855;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Testis specific.
-!- INDUCTION: By thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and cAMP or cAMP-
    analog.
-!- DOMAIN: RII-alpha binding site, predicted to form an amphipathic
    helix, could participate in protein-protein interactions with a
    complementary surface on the R-subunit dimer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 KH domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Tudor domain.
