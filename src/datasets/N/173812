AC   Q9U4X3;
Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] (EC 1.15.1.1).
"Phylogenetic analysis of Drosophila melanogaster group based on Cu-Zn
superoxide dismutase gene sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: Destroys radicals which are normally produced within the
    cells and which are toxic to biological systems.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 superoxide + 2 H(+) = O(2) + H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 copper ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase family.
Antioxidant; Copper; Metal-binding; Oxidoreductase; Zinc.
