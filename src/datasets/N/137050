AC   O68581;
Adenylosuccinate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.4) (IMP--aspartate ligase)
(AdSS) (AMPSase).
"Method for producing the FnuDI restriction endonuclease and
methylase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays an important role in the de novo pathway of purine
    nucleotide biosynthesis.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: GTP + IMP + L-aspartate = GDP + phosphate + 6-
    N-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)-AMP.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; AMP biosynthesis; AMP from IMP:
    step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adenylosuccinate synthetase family.
