AC   Q8DB47;
Fatty acid oxidation complex alpha subunit [Includes: Enoyl-CoA
hydratase (EC 4.2.1.17); 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
(EC 1.1.1.35); 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase (EC 5.1.2.3)].
"Complete genome sequence of Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of an hydroxyacyl-CoA by
    addition of water on enoyl-CoA. Also exhibits 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
    epimerase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (3S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA = trans-2(or 3)-enoyl-
    CoA + H(2)O.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA + NAD(+) = 3-oxoacyl-CoA
    + NADH.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA = (R)-3-
    hydroxybutanoyl-CoA.
-!- PATHWAY: Lipid catabolism; beta-oxidation cycle; from acyl-CoA:
    step B.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer of two alpha chains (fadJ) and two beta
    chains (fadI) (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the enoyl-CoA
    hydratase/isomerase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the central section; belongs to the 3-hydroxyacyl-
    CoA dehydrogenase family.
