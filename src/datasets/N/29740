AC   Q5E9F7; Q3SZ74;
Cofilin-1 (Cofilin, non-muscle isoform).
"Characterization of 954 bovine full-CDS cDNA sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: Controls reversibly actin polymerization and
    depolymerization in a pH-sensitive manner. It has the ability to
    bind G- and F-actin in a 1:1 ratio of cofilin to actin. It is the
    major component of intranuclear and cytoplasmic actin rods (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity). Cytoplasm (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: The phosphorylation of Ser-23 may prevent recognition of the
    nuclear localization signal (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the actin-binding proteins ADF family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ADF-H domain.
