flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: Hydrolyzes cytidine or uridine to ribose and cytosine or
    uracil, respectively. Has a clear preference for cytidine over
    uridine. Strictly specific for ribonucleosides (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: An N-D-ribosylpyrimidine + H(2)O = D-ribose +
    a pyrimidine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion per monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IUNH family. RihB subfamily.
