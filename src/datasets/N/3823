Adenylate cyclase type 1 (EC 4.6.1.1) (Adenylate cyclase type I) (ATP
pyrophosphate-lyase 1) (Adenylyl cyclase 1) (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-
activated adenylyl cyclase).
"Adenylyl cyclase amino acid sequence: possible channel- or
transporter-like structure.";
"Catalytic mechanism of the adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases: modeling
and mutational analysis.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase. May be
    involved in regulatory processes in the central nervous system. It
    may play a role in memory acquisition and learning.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP = 3',5'-cyclic AMP + diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by calcium/calmodulin. Inhibited by
    the G protein beta and gamma subunit complex.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adenylyl cyclase class-4/guanylyl
    cyclase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 guanylate cyclase domains.
