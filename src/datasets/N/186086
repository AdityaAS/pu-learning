AC   P78921; O74816;
Probable T-complex protein 1 subunit theta (TCP-1-theta) (CCT-theta).
"Identification of open reading frames in Schizosaccharomyces pombe
cDNAs.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: Molecular chaperone; assist the folding of proteins upon
    ATP hydrolysis. Known to play a role, in vitro, in the folding of
    actin and tubulin (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Hetero-oligomeric complex of about 850 to 900 kDa that
    forms two stacked rings, 12 to 16 nm in diameter (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TCP-1 chaperonin family.
