AC   P28902;
Guanylin precursor (Guanylate cyclase activator 2A).
"Cloning and expression of guanylin. Its existence in various
mammalian tissues.";
"Rat guanylin cDNA: characterization of the precursor of an endogenous
activator of intestinal guanylate cyclase.";
"Guanylin: an endogenous activator of intestinal guanylate cyclase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Endogenous activator of intestinal guanylate cyclase. It
    stimulates this enzyme through the same receptor binding region as
    the heat-stable enterotoxins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Intestine and in low abundance in adrenal
    gland, kidney, and uterus/oviduct.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the guanylin family.
