AC   Q8TJC4;
Acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase complex beta subunit 2 (EC 2.3.1.-)
(ACDS complex beta subunit 2) (ACDS complex acyltransferase 2).
"The genome of Methanosarcina acetivorans reveals extensive metabolic
and physiological diversity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a complex that catalyzes the reversible cleavage
    of acetyl-CoA, allowing growth on acetate as sole source of carbon
    and energy (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + [acetyl-CoA
    decarbonylase/synthase complex beta subunit] = CoA + acetyl-
    [acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase complex beta subunit].
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 nickel-iron-sulfur cluster.
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis from acetate; third step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer. The ACDS complex is made up of alpha, epsilon,
    beta, gamma and delta chains with a probable stoichiometry of
    (alpha(2)epsilon(2))(4)-beta(8)-(gamma(1)delta(1))(8) (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cdhC family.
