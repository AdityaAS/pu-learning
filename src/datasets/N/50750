Estrogen receptor (ER) (Estradiol receptor) (ER-alpha).
"Zebra finch estrogen receptor cDNA: cloning and mRNA expression.";
-!- FUNCTION: The steroid hormones and their receptors are involved in
    the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and affect cellular
    proliferation and differentiation in target tissues.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds DNA as a homodimer. Can form a heterodimer with ER-
    beta (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- DOMAIN: Composed of three domains: a modulating N-terminal domain,
    a DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal steroid-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor family. NR3
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 nuclear receptor DNA-binding domain.
