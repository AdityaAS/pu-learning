AC   Q6L8H4;
Keratin-associated protein 5-1 (Keratin-associated protein 5.1)
(Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.1).
"Identification of two novel clusters of ultrahigh-sulfur keratin-
associated protein genes on human chromosome 11.";
-!- FUNCTION: In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments
    are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair
    keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the
    formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their
    extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine
    residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-
    sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with hair keratins.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in hair root but not in skin.
    Expressed also in lung, pancreas, ovary, testis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the KRTAP type 5 family.
Keratin; Repeat.
