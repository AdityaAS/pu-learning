AC   P34205;
Deoxyribodipyrimidine photo-lyase (EC 4.1.99.3) (DNA photolyase)
(Photoreactivating enzyme).
"Visible light-inducible photolyase gene from the goldfish Carassius
auratus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in repair of UV radiation-induced DNA damage.
    Catalyzes the light-dependent monomerization (300-600 nm) of
    cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers (in cis-syn configuration), which are
    formed between adjacent bases on the same DNA strand upon exposure
    to ultraviolet radiation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cyclobutadipyrimidine (in DNA) = 2 pyrimidine
    residues (in DNA).
-!- INDUCTION: By visible light.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA photolyase class-2 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DNA photolyase domain.
Chromophore; DNA damage; DNA repair; DNA-binding; FAD; Lyase.
