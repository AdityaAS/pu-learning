AC   P53505;
Actin, cytoplasmic type 5.
"An amphibian cytoskeletal-type actin gene is expressed exclusively in
muscle tissue.";
-!- FUNCTION: Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved
    in various types of cell motility and are ubiquitously expressed
    in all eukaryotic cells.
-!- SUBUNIT: Polymerization of globular actin (G-actin) leads to a
    structural filament (F-actin) in the form of a two-stranded helix.
    Each actin can bind to 4 others.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the actin family.
ATP-binding; Cytoskeleton; Nucleotide-binding; Structural protein.
