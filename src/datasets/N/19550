AC   Q4VIT5;
Calreticulin precursor.
"A mutant cell with a novel defect in MHC class I quality control.";
-!- FUNCTION: Molecular calcium binding chaperone promoting folding,
    oligomeric assembly and quality control in the ER via the
    calreticulin/calnexin cycle. This lectin interacts transiently
    with almost all of the monoglucosylated glycoproteins that are
    synthesized in the ER. Interacts with the DNA-binding domain of
    NR3C1 and mediates its nuclear export (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer. Interacts with PDIA3/ERp57 and with NR3C1 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    lumen (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Can be divided into a N-terminal globular domain, a
    proline-rich P-domain forming an elongated arm-like structure and
    a C-terminal acidic domain. The P-domain binds one molecule of
    calcium with high affinity, whereas the acidic C-domain binds
    multiple calcium ions with low affinity (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The interaction with glycans occurs through a binding site
    in the globular lectin domain (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The zinc binding sites are localized to the N-domain (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Associates with PDIA3 through the tip of the extended arm
    formed by the P-domain (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the calreticulin family.
