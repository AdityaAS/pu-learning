AC   P59097;
Pyranose 2-oxidase precursor (EC 1.1.3.10) (P2Ox) (Pyranose oxidase)
(PROD) (POD) (POx) (Pyranose:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase) (Glucose 2-
oxidase) (FAD-oxidoreductase).
"Nucleic acids encoding polypeptides having pyranose oxidase
activity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the oxidation of various aldopyranoses and
    disaccharides on carbon-2 to the corresponding 2-keto sugars
    concomitant with the reduction of O(2) to H(2)O(2). Plays an
    important role in lignin degradation of wood rot fungi by
    supplying the essential cosubstrate H(2)O(2) for the ligninolytic
    peroxidases, lignin peroxidase and manganese-dependent peroxidase.
    The preferred substrate is D-glucose which is converted to 2-
    dehydro-D-glucose, an intermediate of a secondary metabolic
    pathway leading to the antibiotic cortalcerone. Acts also on D-
    xylose, together with D-glucose the major sugars derived from
    wood, on L-sorbose, D-galactose and 1,5-anhydroglucitol, a
    diagnostic marker of diabetes mellitus.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-glucose + O(2) = 2-dehydro-D-glucose +
    H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD covalently per subunit (By similarity).
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 6. Active and stable from pH 3 to 9;
    Temperature dependence:
      Optimum temperature is 30-50 degrees Celsius. Active and
      thermostable for 30 minutes up to 55 degrees Celsius;
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Note=Hyphal periplasmic space (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GMC oxidoreductase family.
