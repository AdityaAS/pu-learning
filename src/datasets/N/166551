AC   Q9KNZ8;
30S ribosomal protein S8.
"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly to 16S rRNA central domain where it helps coordinate
    assembly of the platform of the 30S subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts proteins S5
    and S12 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S8P family.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
