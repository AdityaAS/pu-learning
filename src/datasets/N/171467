(PSAT).
"Molecular characterization of plastidic phosphoserine
aminotransferase in serine biosynthesis from Arabidopsis.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 4 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: O-phospho-L-serine + 2-oxoglutarate = 3-
    phosphonooxypyruvate + L-glutamate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4-phosphonooxy-L-threonine + 2-oxoglutarate =
    (3R)-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-phosphonooxybutanoate + L-glutamate.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-serine biosynthesis; L-serine
    from 3-phospho-D-glycerate: step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; pyridoxine 5'-phosphate
    biosynthesis; pyridoxine 5'-phosphate from D-erythrose 4-
    phosphate: step 3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-V pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
    aminotransferase family.
