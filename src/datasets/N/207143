AC   Q8K9R8;
Xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.22) (Xanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase) (XGPRT).
"50 million years of genomic stasis in endosymbiotic bacteria.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts on guanine, xanthine and to a lesser extent
    hypoxanthine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 9-(5-phospho-beta-D-ribosyl)xanthine +
    diphosphate = 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate + xanthine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 sulfate ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Purine salvage.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the purine/pyrimidine
    phosphoribosyltransferase family. XGPT subfamily.
