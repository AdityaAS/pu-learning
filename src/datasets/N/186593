AC   P43025;
Tetranectin precursor (TN) (C-type lectin domain family 3 member B)
(Plasminogen kringle 4-binding protein).
"Cloning of a cDNA encoding murine tetranectin.";
"Mouse tetranectin: cDNA sequence, tissue-specific expression, and
chromosomal mapping.";
"Cloning of the murine tetranectin gene and 5'-flanking region.";
-!- FUNCTION: Tetranectin binds to plasminogen and to isolated kringle
    4. May be involved in the packaging of molecules destined for
    exocytosis (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highest expression in lung and skeletal
    muscle.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 C-type lectin domain.
