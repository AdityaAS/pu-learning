Chloroplast 30S ribosomal protein S4 (Fragment).
"The chloroplast gene rps4 as a tool for the study of Poaceae
phylogeny.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly to 16S rRNA where it nucleates assembly of the body of
    the 30S subunit (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: With S5 and S12 plays an important role in translational
    accuracy (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts protein S5.
    The interaction surface between S4 and S5 is involved in control
    of translational fidelity (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S4P family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 S4 RNA-binding domain.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
