-!- FUNCTION: Component of the transcription factor SL1/TIFIB complex
    involved in the assembly of the PIC (preinitiation complex).
    Recruits RNA polymerase I to the rRNA gene promoter via
    interaction with RRN3.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the transcription factor SL1/TIFIB complex,
    composed of TBP and at least TAF1A, TAF1B and TAF1C. In the
    complex interacts directly with TBP, TAF1A and TAF1B. Interaction
    of the SL1/TIFIB subunits with TBP excluded interaction with the
    transcription factor IID (TFIID) subunits. Interacts with MYC,
    RRN3 and p53/TP53 with low affinity.
