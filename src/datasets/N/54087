-!- FUNCTION: Ferredoxin are iron-sulfur proteins that transfer
    electrons in a wide variety of metabolic reactions. Although the
    function of this ferredoxin is unknown it is probable that it has
    a role as a cellular electron transfer protein. Involved in the in
    vivo assembly of the Fe-S clusters in a wide variety of iron-
    sulfur proteins (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adrenodoxin/putidaredoxin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain.
