-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits viral infection of plants, and protein
    synthesis in vitro.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endohydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond at one
    specific adenosine on the 28S rRNA.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Spring leaves and roots.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosome-inactivating protein family.
    Type 1 RIP subfamily.
