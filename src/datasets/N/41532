AC   Q05621;
Dihydropteroate synthase (EC 2.5.1.15) (DHPS) (Dihydropteroate
pyrophosphorylase) (Fragment).
"Cloning and sequence analysis of the genes encoding
phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase from Clostridium
acetobutylicum NCIMB 8052.";
-!- FUNCTION: DHPS catalyzes the formation of the immediate precursor
    of folic acid. It is implicated in resistance to sulfonamide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-
    dihydropteridine diphosphate + 4-aminobenzoate = diphosphate +
    dihydropteroate.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis;
    tetrahydrofolate from 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-
    dihydropteridine diphosphate and 4-aminobenzoate: step 1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DHPS family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 pterin-binding domain.
Antibiotic resistance; Folate biosynthesis; Transferase.
