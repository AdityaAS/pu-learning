AC   P0AEC9; P39272; P76795;
Sensor protein dcuS (EC 2.7.13.3).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Member of the two-component regulatory system dcuR/dcuS.
    Involved in the C4-dicarboxylate-stimulated regulation of the
    genes encoding the anaerobic fumarate respiratory system (frdABCD;
    nuoAN; dcuB; dcuC; sdhCDAB; etc.). Weakly regulates the aerobic
    C4-dicarboxylate transporter dctA. Activates dcuR by
    phosphorylation (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + protein L-histidine = ADP + protein N-
    phospho-L-histidine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Autophosphorylated. The phosphoryl group is rapidely
    transferred to dcuR (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 histidine kinase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domain.
