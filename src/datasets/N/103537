AC   Q3A2G3;
Phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase (EC 2.7.8.13) (UDP-
MurNAc-pentapeptide phosphotransferase).
"Complete sequence of Pelobacter carbinolicus DSM 2380.";
-!- FUNCTION: First step of the lipid cycle reactions in the
    biosynthesis of the cell wall peptidoglycan (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-Mur2Ac(oyl-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-
    D-Ala) + undecaprenyl phosphate = UMP + Mur2Ac(oyl-L-Ala-gamma-D-
    Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala)-diphosphoundecaprenol.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycan biosynthesis; peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 4 family. MraY
    subfamily.
