enzyme for N-terminal of ribosomal protein L7/L12).
"Cloning and molecular characterization of the gene rimL which encodes
an enzyme acetylating ribosomal protein L12 of Escherichia coli K12.";
"A 570-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 28.0-40.1 min region on the linkage map.";

-!- FUNCTION: This enzyme acetylates the N-terminal serine of
    ribosomal protein L7/L12.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + ribosomal-protein L-serine = CoA
    + ribosomal-protein N-acetyl-L-serine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acetyltransferase family. RimL
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 N-acetyltransferase domain.
