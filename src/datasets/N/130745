AC   O33506;
Coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein E (Pyrroloquinoline quinone
biosynthesis protein E).
"Expression of genes from Rahnella aquatilis that are necessary for
mineral phosphate solubilization in Escherichia coli.";
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster. The cluster is coordinated with
    3 cysteines and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the radical SAM superfamily. PqqE family.
-!- CAUTION: An expected iron ligand Cys residue was not found at
    position 29 in this sequence.
