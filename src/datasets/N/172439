-!- FUNCTION: NAD-dependent deacetylase, which regulates processes
    such as apoptosis and muscle differentiation by deacetylating key
    proteins. Deacetylates 'Lys-382' of p53/TP53 and impairs its
    ability to induce proapoptotic program and modulate cell
    senescence. Deacetylates TAF1B and thereby represses rDNA
    transcription by the RNA polymerase I. Involved in HES1- and HEY2-
    mediated transcriptional repression. Inhibits skeletal muscle
    differentiation by deacetylating PCAF and MYOD1. May serve as a
    sensor of the cytosolic ratio of NAD(+)/NADH, which is essential
    in skeletal muscle cell differentiation. Despite some ability to
    deacetylate histones in vitro, such activity is either weak or
    inexistent in vivo. In case of HIV-1 infection, interacts with and
    deacetylates the viral Tat protein.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NAD(+) + an acetylprotein = nicotinamide + O-
    acetyl-ADP-ribose + a protein.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by nicotinamide. Activated by
    resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), butein (3,4,2',4'-
    tetrahydroxychalcone), piceatannol (3,5,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-trans-
    stilbene), Isoliquiritigenin (4,2',4'-trihydroxychalcone), fisetin
    (3,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone) and quercetin (3,5,7,3',4'-
    pentahydroxyflavone).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with TAF1B. Found in a complex with PCAF and
    MYOD1 (By similarity). Interacts with MLLT7/FOXO4, HES1, HEY2,
    p53/TP53 and PML.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Note=Recruited to the nuclear
    bodies via its interaction with PML.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Red wine, which contains resveratrol, may
    participate to activate sirtuin proteins, and may therefore
    participate to extend lifespan as it has been observed in yeast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sirtuin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 deacetylase sirtuin-type domain.
