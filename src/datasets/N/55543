AC   P26477;
Negative regulator of flagellin synthesis (Anti-sigma-28 factor).
"Molecular characterization of flgM, a gene encoding a negative
regulator of flagellin synthesis in Salmonella typhimurium.";
"Mutation of flgM attenuates virulence of Salmonella typhimurium, and
mutation of fliA represses the attenuated phenotype.";
"Sequence analysis of the flgA gene and its adjacent region in
Salmonella typhimurium, and identification of another flagellar gene,
flgN.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Molecular dissection of the flagellum-specific anti-sigma factor,
FlgM, of Salmonella typhimurium.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the coupling of flagellin expression to
    flagellar assembly by preventing expression of the flagellin genes
    when a component of the middle class of proteins is defective. It
    negatively regulates flagellar genes by inhibiting the activity of
    fliA by directly binding to fliA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Note=After completion of the
    hook-basal body structure, it is exported out of the cell through
    the completely assembled hook-basal body structures.
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal domain is essential for export and the C-
    terminal domain possess the fliA binding site.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the flgM family.
