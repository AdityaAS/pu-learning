AC   Q887D9;
Formamidase (EC 3.5.1.49) (Formamide amidohydrolase).
"The complete genome sequence of the Arabidopsis and tomato pathogen
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.";
-!- FUNCTION: Is an aliphatic amidase with a restricted substrate
    specificity, as it only hydrolyzes formamide (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Formamide + H(2)O = formate + NH(3).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nitrilase superfamily. Aliphatic
    amidase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CN hydrolase domain.
