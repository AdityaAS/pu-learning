UvrABC system protein C (Protein uvrC) (Excinuclease ABC subunit C).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: The UvrABC repair system catalyzes the recognition and
    processing of DNA lesions. UvrC both incises the 5' and 3' sides
    of the lesion. The N-terminal half is responsible for the 3'
    incision and the C-terminal half is responsible for the 5'
    incision (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with uvrB in an incision complex (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the uvrC family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 UVR domain.
