AC   Q9WYC9;
Gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase (EC 1.2.1.41) (GPR) (Glutamate-5-
semialdehyde dehydrogenase) (Glutamyl-gamma-semialdehyde
dehydrogenase) (GSA dehydrogenase).
"Evidence for lateral gene transfer between Archaea and Bacteria from
genome sequence of Thermotoga maritima.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the NADPH dependent reduction of L-gamma-
    glutamyl 5-phosphate into L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde and
    phosphate. The product spontaneously undergoes cyclization to form
    1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde + phosphate +
    NADP(+) = L-glutamyl 5-phosphate + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-proline biosynthesis; L-
    glutamate 5-semialdehyde from L-glutamate: step 2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase
    family.
