Cytochrome c.
"The amino acid sequence of cytochrome c from Abutilon theophrasti
Medic. and Gossypium barbadense L. (cotton).";
-!- FUNCTION: Electron carrier protein. The oxidized form of the
    cytochrome c heme group can accept an electron from the heme group
    of the cytochrome c1 subunit of cytochrome reductase. Cytochrome c
    then transfers this electron to the cytochrome oxidase complex,
    the final protein carrier in the mitochondrial electron-transport
    chain.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial matrix.
-!- PTM: Binds 1 heme group per subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c family.
