-!- FUNCTION: Lamins are components of the nuclear lamina, a fibrous
    layer on the nucleoplasmic side of the inner nuclear membrane,
    which is thought to provide a framework for the nuclear envelope
    and may also interact with chromatin (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nuclear inner membrane; lipid-
    anchor; nucleoplasmic side (By similarity).
-!- PTM: B-type lamins undergo a series of modifications, such as
    farnesylation and phosphorylation. Increased phosphorylation of
    the lamins occurs before envelope disintegration and probably
    plays a role in regulating lamin associations (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The structural integrity of the lamina is strictly
    controlled by the cell cycle, as seen by the disintegration and
    formation of the nuclear envelope in prophase and telophase,
    respectively (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the intermediate filament family.
