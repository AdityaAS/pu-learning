Auxin-responsive protein IAA15 (Indoleacetic acid-induced protein 15).
"Nucleotide sequence of the putative Arabidopsis IAA21.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Genetics of Aux/IAA and ARF action in plant growth and development.";
"Aux/IAA proteins contain a potent transcriptional repression
domain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived transcriptional factors
    that function as repressor of early auxin response genes at low
    auxin concentrations. Repression is thought to result from the
    interaction with auxin response factors (ARFs), proteins that bind
    to the auxin-responsive promoter element (AuxRE). Formation of
    heterodimers with ARF proteins may alter their ability to modulate
    early auxin response genes expression.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homo and heterodimers (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By auxin (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal half of the protein contains two conserved
    domains I and II. Domain I includes a slightly degenerated ERF-
    associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif which seems to be
    involved in the activity of transcriptional repression. Domain II
    is required for the correct degradation of the protein through the
    SCF-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Interactions between
    Aux/IAA proteins and auxin response factors (ARFs) occur through
    their C-terminal dimerization domains III and IV.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Aux/IAA family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Aux/IAA-ARF domain.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) erroneously termed IAA21.
