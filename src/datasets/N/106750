AC   Q9ZDC2;
UDP-N-acetylmuramoylalanine--D-glutamate ligase (EC 6.3.2.9) (UDP-N-
acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate synthetase) (D-glutamic acid-
adding enzyme).
"The genome sequence of Rickettsia prowazekii and the origin of
mitochondria.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cell wall formation. Catalyzes the addition of glutamate
    to the nucleotide precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine (UMA)
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine +
    glutamate = ADP + phosphate + UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-
    glutamate.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycan biosynthesis; peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the murCDEF family.
