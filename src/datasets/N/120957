AC   P70683;
Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase precursor (EC 3.1.1.47)
(PAF acetylhydrolase) (PAF 2-acylhydrolase) (LDL-associated
phospholipase A2) (LDL-PLA(2)) (2-acetyl-1-alkylglycerophosphocholine
esterase) (1-alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine esterase).
"Cloning, expression and characterization of plasma platelet-
activating factor-acetylhydrolase from guinea pig.";
-!- FUNCTION: Modulates the action of platelet-activating factor (PAF)
    by hydrolyzing the sn-2 ester bond to yield the biologically
    inactive lyso-PAF. Has a specificity for substrates with a short
    residue at the sn-2 position. It is inactive against long-chain
    phospholipids.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine +
    H(2)O = 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + acetate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein; extracellular space.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Plasma.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the AB hydrolase superfamily. Lipase
    family.
