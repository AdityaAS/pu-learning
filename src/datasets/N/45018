AC   P52237; Q51754;
Thiol:disulfide interchange protein dsbE (Cytochrome c biogenesis
protein ccmG).
"A cytochrome c biogenesis gene involved in pyoverdine production in
Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 17400.";
"A chromosomal locus required for copper resistance, competitive
fitness, and cytochrome c biogenesis in Pseudomonas fluorescens.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in disulfide bond formation. Catalyzes a late,
    reductive step in the assembly of periplasmic c-type cytochromes,
    probably the reduction of disulfide bonds of the apocytochrome c
    to allow covalent linkage with the heme. Possible subunit of a
    heme lyase (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass membrane
    protein; periplasmic side (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the thioredoxin family. DsbE subfamily.
