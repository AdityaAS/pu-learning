(Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase II) (FGAM synthase II).
"Life in hot carbon monoxide: the complete genome sequence of
Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z-2901.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 2-N-formyl-1-N-(5-phospho-D-
    ribosyl)glycinamide + L-glutamine + H(2)O = ADP + phosphate + 2-
    (formamido)-1-N-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)acetamidine + L-glutamate.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; IMP biosynthesis; 5-amino-1-(5-
    phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide from 2-N-formyl-1-N-(5-
    phospho-D-ribosyl)glycinamide: step 1.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Purine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of two subunits, purQ and purL.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FGAMS family.
