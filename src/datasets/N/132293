Ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase II (EC 2.7.6.1) (Phosphoribosyl
pyrophosphate synthetase II) (PRS-II).
"Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of two distinct cDNAs for
rat phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase.";
"Complete cDNA sequence of rat phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase
subunit II (PRS II).";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + D-ribose 5-phosphate = AMP + 5-phospho-
    alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by magnesium and inorganic phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; 5-phospho-alpha-D-
    ribose 1-diphosphate biosynthesis; 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-
    diphosphate from D-ribose 5-phosphate (route I): single step
    [final step].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase
    family.
Direct protein sequencing; Kinase; Magnesium; Metal-binding;
