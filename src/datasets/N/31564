Cytochrome P450 26B1 (EC 1.14.-.-) (P450 26A2) (P450 retinoic acid-
inactivating 2) (P450RAI-2) (Retinoic acid-metabolizing cytochrome).
"Identification of the human cytochrome P450, P450RAI-2, which is
predominantly expressed in the adult cerebellum and is responsible for
all-trans-retinoic acid metabolism.";
"Generation and annotation of the DNA sequences of human chromosomes 2
and 4.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a key role in retinoic acid metabolism. Involved
    in the specific inactivation of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA).
    Responsible for generation of several hydroxylated forms of RA,
    including 4-OH-RA, 4-oxo-RA, and 18-OH-RA.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Has a preferred activity towards the following
    substrates: all-trans-RA > 9-cis-RA > 13-cis-RA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in brain, particularly in the
    cerebellum and pons.
-!- INDUCTION: By retinoic acid.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family.
