Probable cell division protein ftsW.
"The complete genome sequence of the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus
lactis ssp. lactis IL1403.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a septum-peptidoglycan biosynthetic protein,
    involved in cell wall formation. Plays a role in the stabilization
    of the ftsZ ring during cell division (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ftsW/rodA/spoVE family.
