AC   P28881; Q9UB25;
Omega-conotoxin SVIB precursor (SNX-183).
"Conopeptides from Conus striatus and Conus textile by cDNA cloning.";
"Novel alpha- and omega-conotoxins from Conus striatus venom.";
"A consensus structure for omega-conotoxins with different
selectivities for voltage-sensitive calcium channel subtypes:
comparison of MVIIA, SVIB and SNX-202.";
-!- FUNCTION: Omega-conotoxins act at presynaptic membranes, they bind
    and block voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC). This toxin
    blocks N-, P- and Q-type calcium channels.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom duct.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the conotoxin O superfamily. Omega-type
    family.
