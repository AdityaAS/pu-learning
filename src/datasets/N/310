AC   Q9TNN7; O02866; O62888; Q9TPV8; Q9TPX2;
HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, Cw-5 alpha chain precursor
(MHC class I antigen Cw*5).
"New HLA-C alleles, on the basis of their transmembrane or cytoplasmic
regions.";
"Cw*0501new.";
"HLA-C locus polymorphisms in Japanese.";
"Novel HLA-C allele.";
"Identification of a novel HLA-Cw*05 allele, Cw*0503.";
"New HLA-Cw5 antigen.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the presentation of foreign antigens to the
    immune system.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha chain and a beta chain (beta-2-
    microglobulin). Interacts with human herpesvirus 8 MIR1 protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- PTM: Polyubiquitinated in a post ER compartment by interaction
    with human herpesvirus 8 MIR1 protein. This targets the protein
    for rapid degradation via the ubiquitin system (By similarity).
-!- POLYMORPHISM: The following alleles of Cw-5 are known: Cw*0501
    Cw*0502, Cw*0503 and Cw*0504. The sequence shown is that of
    Cw*0501.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MHC class I family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like C1-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
