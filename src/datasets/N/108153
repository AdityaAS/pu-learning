(MLCK2).

-!- FUNCTION: Implicated in the level of global muscle contraction and
    cardiac function. Phosphorylates a specific serine in the N-
    terminus of a myosin light chain.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + [myosin light-chain] = ADP + [myosin
    light-chain] phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Note=Colocalizes with
    phosphorylated myosin light chain (RLCP) at filaments of the
    myofibrils.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Heart and skeletal muscles. Increased
    expression in the apical tissue compared to the interventricular
    septal tissue.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in MYLK2 are a cause of familial hypertrophic
    cardiomyopathy (CMH) [MIM:192600]; also designated FHC or HCM.
    Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heart disorder
    characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, which is usually
    asymmetric and often involves the interventricular septum. The
    prevalence of the disease in the general population is 0.2%. FHC
    is clinically heterogeneous, with inter- and intrafamilial
    variations ranging from benign to malignant forms with high risk
    of cardiac failure and sudden cardiac death.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
