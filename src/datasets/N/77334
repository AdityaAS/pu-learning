AC   Q66QC7;
Sperm protamine P1.
"Species identification among horse (Equus caballus) and donkey (Equus
asinus) and their hybrids by PCR-RFLP.";
-!- FUNCTION: Protamines substitute for histones in the chromatin of
    sperm during the haploid phase of spermatogenesis. They compact
    sperm DNA into a highly condensed, stable and inactive complex (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Cross-linked by interchain disulfide bonds around the
    DNA-helix (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Testis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the protamine P1 family.
