AC   P93299; P92546;
Hypothetical mitochondrial protein AtMg00430/AtMg01150
(ORF106a/ORF106g).
"The mitochondrial genome of Arabidopsis thaliana contains 57 genes in
366,924 nucleotides.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 2 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: A stretch of 270 kb of the mitochondrial genome is
    duplicated within the centromer of chromosome 2 resulting in the
    duplication of the gene. The expression of this duplicated gene
    (At2g07701) is not demonstrated.
Hypothetical protein; Mitochondrion.
