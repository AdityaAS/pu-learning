Light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase subunit B
(EC 1.18.-.-) (LI-POR subunit B) (DPOR subunit B) (Fragment).
"Phylogenetic inferences from chloroplast chlB gene sequences of
Nephrolepis exaltata (Filicopsida), Ephedra altissima (Gnetopsida),
and diverse land plants.";
-!- FUNCTION: Uses Mg-ATP and reduced ferredoxin to reduce ring D of
    protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to form chlorophyllide a (Chlide)
    (By similarity). This reaction is light-independent.
-!- PATHWAY: Light-independent chlorophyll biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Protochlorophyllide reductase is thought to be composed
    of three subunits; chlL, chlN and chlB. Could form a
    heterotetramer of two chlB and two chlN subunits (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chlB/bchB/bchZ family.
