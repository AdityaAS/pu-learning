(HPPDase).
"Gene discovery and gene function assignment in filamentous fungi.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate + O(2) = homogentisate
    + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 iron ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid degradation; L-phenylalanine degradation;
    acetoacetate and fumarate from L-phenylalanine: step 3.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 4HPPD family.
