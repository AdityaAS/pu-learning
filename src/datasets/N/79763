Isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase 1 (EC 5.3.3.2) (IPP isomerase
1) (Isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase 1) (IPP:DMAPP isomerase 1).
"The genome sequence of an anaerobic aromatic-degrading denitrifying
bacterium, strain EbN1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the 1,3-allylic rearrangement of the
    homoallylic substrate isopentenyl (IPP) to its highly
    electrophilic allylic isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Isopentenyl diphosphate = dimethylallyl
    diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit. The magnesium ion
    binds only when substrate is bound (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 manganese ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; dimethylallyl-PP biosynthesis;
    dimethylallyl-PP from isopentenyl-PP: single step [final step].
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IPP isomerase type 1 family.
