AC   Q5FUR7;
4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase (EC 1.17.4.3) (1-
hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase).
"Complete genome sequence of the acetic acid bacterium Gluconobacter
oxydans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Converts 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate
    (ME-2,4cPP) into 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl
    diphosphate + H(2)O + protein-disulfide = 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
    2,4-cyclodiphosphate + protein-dithiol.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; isopentenyl-PP biosynthesis via
    DXP pathway; isopentenyl-PP from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:
    step 5.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ispG family.
