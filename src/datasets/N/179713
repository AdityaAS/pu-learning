AC   Q63SX4;
Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.17) (Glutamate--tRNA ligase)
(GluRS).
"Genomic plasticity of the causative agent of melioidosis,
Burkholderia pseudomallei.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-glutamate + tRNA(Glu) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-glutamyl-tRNA(Glu).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
