-!- FUNCTION: This molybdenum-iron protein is part of the nitrogenase
    complex that catalyzes the key enzymatic reactions in nitrogen
    fixation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 8 reduced ferredoxin + 8 H(+) + N(2) + 16 ATP
    + 16 H(2)O = 8 oxidized ferredoxin + H(2) + 2 NH(3) + 16 ADP + 16
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 8Fe-7S cluster per heterodimer.
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta chains. Forms complex
    with the iron protein (nitrogenase component 2).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nifD/nifK/nifE/nifN family.
-!- CAUTION: The authors of Ref.4 originally stated that their
    sequence was from Frankia sp.
