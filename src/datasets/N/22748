Signal transducer CD24 precursor.
"CD24, a signal transducer modulating B cell activation responses, is
a very short peptide with a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol membrane
anchor.";
"CD24, a signal-transducing molecule expressed on human B cells, is a
major surface antigen on small cell lung carcinomas.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Mapping of CD24 and homologous sequences to multiple chromosomal
loci.";
-!- FUNCTION: Modulates B-cell activation responses. Signaling could
    be triggered by the binding of a lectin-like ligand to the CD24
    carbohydrates, and transduced by the release of second messengers
    derived from the GPI-anchor. Promotes AG-dependent proliferation
    of B-cells, and prevents their terminal differentiation into
    antibody-forming cells.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; GPI-anchor.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: B-cells.
-!- INDUCTION: Expression is lost when primary B-cells are induced to
    differentiate in antibody-forming cells.
-!- PTM: Extensively O-glycosylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CD24 family.
