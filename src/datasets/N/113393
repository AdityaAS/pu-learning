cDNAs.";
"Human partial CDS from CD34+ stem cells.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Identification of a NIPSNAP homologue as host cell target for
Salmonella virulence protein SpiC.";
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with the Salmonella typhimurium virulence
    protein spiC.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm; cytosol. Note=May be part of some
    vesicular structure distinct from lysosomal vesicles.

    and muscle. Expressed at intermediate level in brain, heart,
    colon, thymus, kidney, small intestine, placenta, lung, leukocytes
    and spleen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NipSnap family.
