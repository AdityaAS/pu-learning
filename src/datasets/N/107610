AC   Q7V9M5;
DNA mismatch repair protein mutS.
"Genome sequence of the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus SS120,
a nearly minimal oxyphototrophic genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is involved in the repair of mismatches in
    DNA. It is possible that it carries out the mismatch recognition
    step. This protein has a weak ATPase activity (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA mismatch repair mutS family.
ATP-binding; Complete proteome; DNA damage; DNA repair; DNA-binding;
