AC   Q89AJ3;
30S ribosomal protein S1.
"Reductive genome evolution in Buchnera aphidicola.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds mRNA; thus facilitating recognition of the
    initiation point. It is needed to translate mRNA with a short
    Shine-Dalgarno (SD) purine-rich sequence (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S1P family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 S1 motif domains.
Complete proteome; Repeat; Ribonucleoprotein; Ribosomal protein;
RNA-binding.
