AC   Q8PY83;
CoB--CoM heterodisulfide reductase 1 subunit B (EC 1.8.98.1).
"The genome of Methanosarcina mazei: evidence for lateral gene
transfer between Bacteria and Archaea.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a complex that catalyzes the reversible
    reduction of CoM-S-S-CoB to the thiol-coenzymes H-S-CoM (coenzyme
    M) and H-S-CoB (coenzyme B). HdrB may have a function in energy
    transduction (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Coenzyme B + coenzyme M + methanophenazine =
    N-(7-((2-sulfoethyl)dithio)heptanoyl)-3-O-phospho-L-threonine +
    dihydromethanophenazine.
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis from carbon dioxide; eighth (last) step.
-!- SUBUNIT: The heterodisulfide reductase 1 is composed of three
    subunits; hdrA, hdrB and hdrC (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hdrB family.
