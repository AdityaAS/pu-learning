AC   Q8MKH0;
Interleukin-6 precursor (IL-6).
"Molecular cloning, characterization, and quantification of squirrel
monkey (Saimiri sciureus) Th1 and Th2 cytokines.";
-!- FUNCTION: IL-6 is a cytokine with a wide variety of biological
    functions: it plays an essential role in the final differentiation
    of B-cells into Ig-secreting cells, it induces myeloma and
    plasmacytoma growth, it induces nerve cells differentiation, in
    hepatocytes it induces acute phase reactants.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IL-6 superfamily.
