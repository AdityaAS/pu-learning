Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 41 (Vacuolar morphogenesis
protein 2).
"Vam2/Vps41p and Vam6/Vps39p are components of a protein complex on
the vacuolar membranes and involved in the vacuolar assembly in the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";

-!- FUNCTION: Required for vacuolar assembly and vacuolar traffic.
    Acts as component of the HOPS complex that acts during the docking
    stage of vacuole fusion. HOPS is an effector for the vacuolar Rab
    GTPase YPT7 and is required for vacuolar SNARE complex assembly.
    It remains bound to SNARE complexes after vacuole fusion.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the HOPS complex which is composed of PEP5,
    VPS16, PEP3, VPS33, VPS39 and VPS41. HOPS associates with
    phosphoinositides and the PX domain of VAM7. Interacts with VAM7
    and VPS39.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P38623:RCK2; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-20432, EBI-14885;
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1170 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the VPS41 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 clathrin repeat.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 WD repeats.
