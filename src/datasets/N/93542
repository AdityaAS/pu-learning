AC   Q8ERL8;
Lipoyl synthase (EC 2.8.1.-) (Lipoic acid synthase) (Lipoate synthase)
(Lipoyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase) (Sulfur insertion protein lipA)
(Lip-syn).
"Genome sequence of Oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from the Iheya
Ridge and its unexpected adaptive capabilities to extreme
environments.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the radical-mediated insertion of two sulfur
    atoms into an octanoyl group bound to acyl-carrier-protein (ACP)
    to produce a lipoyl group (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Octanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + 2 sulfurs =
    lipoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein].
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster. The cluster is coordinated with
    3 cysteines and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine (By
    similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 3Fe-4S cluster (Potential).
-!- PATHWAY: Lipoate biosynthesis; sulfur-insertion step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the biotin and lipoic acid synthetases
    family. LipA subfamily.
