Beta-defensin 8 precursor (Defensin, beta 8) (BD-8) (mBD-8) (Defensin-
related peptide) (Defr1).
"Identification and characterisation a novel murine beta defensin
related gene.";
"Cloning and characterization of mBD-7 and mBD-8, two novel mouse
beta-defensins.";
"Structure determination of human and murine beta-defensins reveals
structural conservation in the absence of significant sequence
similarity.";
-!- FUNCTION: A synthetic peptide displays antimicrobial activities
    against S.aureus, P.aeruginosa, E.coli and B.cepacia. The
    antimicrobial activity against S.aureus, E.coli and B.cepacia is
    reduced in raised concentration of NaCl, but its action against
    P.aeruginosa is independent of NaCl concentration.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Most highly expressed in testis and heart.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the beta-defensin family.
