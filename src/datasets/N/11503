AC   Q9FYL3; Q9FYL4;
Protein ARTEMIS, chloroplast precursor (Arabidopsis thaliana envelope
membrane integrase) (Ath4) (ALBINO3-like protein 1).
"Cell and chloroplast division requires ARTEMIS.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required during late stages of chloroplast division.
    Probably involved in the positioning of constriction ring(s) and
    recruitment of the envelope-located division apparatus. Not
    involved in general protein translocation into chloroplast, like
    light-harvesting complex protein insertion or photosystem II
    assembly.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast inner
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in green tissues, and barely
    detected in roots and flowers.
-!- DOMAIN: Consists of three domains: a N-terminal receptor-like
    region, a central Gly/Ser-rich stretch containing a GTP-binding
    site, and a C-terminal YidC/Oxa1p/Alb3 protein translocase-like
    domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the OXA1/oxaA
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequences differ from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
-!- CAUTION: This protein is a fusion of two formerly distinct coding
    sequences.
