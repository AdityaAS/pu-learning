AC   Q3IP66;
Probable DNA primase small subunit (EC 2.7.7.-).
"Living with two extremes: conclusions from the genome sequence of
Natronomonas pharaonis.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA primase is the polymerase that synthesizes small RNA
    primers for the Okazaki fragments on both template strands at
    replication forks during chromosomal DNA synthesis (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a small subunit and a large subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eukaryotic-type primase small subunit
    family.
Complete proteome; DNA replication; DNA-directed RNA polymerase;
Nucleotidyltransferase; Primosome; Transferase.
