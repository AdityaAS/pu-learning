AC   Q5HXU1;
Error-prone DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7).
"Complete genome sequence of the acetic acid bacterium Gluconobacter
oxydans.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA polymerase involved in damage-induced mutagenesis
    and translesion synthesis (TLS). It is not the major replicative
    DNA polymerase (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA polymerase type-C family. DnaE2
    subfamily.
 GO:0045020; P:error-prone DNA repair; IEA:HAMAP.
