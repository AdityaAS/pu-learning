"Presence of two active forms of cytosolic Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase
enzyme in the marine yeast Debaryomyces hansenii.";
-!- FUNCTION: Destroys radicals which are normally produced within the
    cells and which are toxic to biological systems (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 superoxide + 2 H(+) = O(2) + H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 copper ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase family.
