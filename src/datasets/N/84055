AC   Q5HSI4;
IspD/ispF bifunctional enzyme [Includes: 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-
phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.60) (4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-
methyl-D-erythritol synthase) (MEP cytidylyltransferase) (MCT); 2-C-

(MECPS) (MECDP-synthase)].
"Major structural differences and novel potential virulence mechanisms
from the genomes of multiple Campylobacter species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 4-
    diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol from CTP and 2-C-methyl-
    D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) (ispD), and converts 4-
    diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2-phosphate into 2-C-
    methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MECDP) and CMP (ispF)
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CTP + 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate =
    diphosphate + 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-phospho-4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-
    methyl-D-erythritol = 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate
    + CMP.
-!- COFACTOR: Divalent metal cations (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; isopentenyl-PP biosynthesis via
    DXP pathway; isopentenyl-PP from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:
    step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; isopentenyl-PP biosynthesis via
    DXP pathway; isopentenyl-PP from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:
    step 4.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the ispD family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the ispF family.
