Endonuclease VIII-like 1 (EC 3.2.2.-) (EC 4.2.99.18) (Nei-like 1) (DNA
glycosylase/AP lyase Neil1) (DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase
Neil1) (NEH1).

(endonuclease VIII) homologue.";

-!- FUNCTION: Involved in base excision repair of DNA damaged by
    oxidation or by mutagenic agents. Acts as DNA glycosylase that
    recognizes and removes damaged bases. Has a preference for
    oxidized pyrimidines, such as thymine glycol, formamidopyrimidine
    (Fapy) and 5-hydroxyuracil. Has marginal activity towards 8-
    oxoguanine. Has AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lyase activity and
    introduces nicks in the DNA strand. Cleaves the DNA backbone by
    beta-delta elimination to generate a single-strand break at the
    site of the removed base with both 3'- and 5'-phosphates. Has DNA
    glycosylase/lyase activity towards mismatched uracil and thymine,
    in particular in U:C and T:C mismatches (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Removes damaged bases from DNA, leaving an
    abasic site.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: The C-O-P bond 3' to the apurinic or
    apyrimidinic site in DNA is broken by a beta-elimination reaction,
    leaving a 3'-terminal unsaturated sugar and a product with a
    terminal 5'-phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).

    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;

      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Detected in heart, spleen and lung.
-!- INDUCTION: Up-regulated during S-phase (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FPG family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 343.
