AC   Q6GHI0;
GTP-sensing transcriptional pleiotropic repressor codY.
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-binding protein that represses the expression of
    many genes that are induced as cells make the transition from
    rapid exponential growth to stationary phase (By similarity). It
    is a GTP-binding protein that senses the intracellular GTP
    concentration as an indicator of nutritional limitations. At low
    GTP concentration it no longer binds GTP and stop to act as a
    transcriptional repressor (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the codY family.
