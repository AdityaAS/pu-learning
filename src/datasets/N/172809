AC   P10149;
Shiga toxin A-chain precursor (EC 3.2.2.22) (rRNA N-glycosidase).
"Cloning and sequencing of the genes for Shiga toxin from Shigella
dysenteriae type 1.";
"Cloning and primary structure of Shigella toxin genes.";
"The primary structure of the operons coding for Shigella dysenteriae
toxin and temperature phage H30 shiga-like toxin.";
-!- FUNCTION: The A chain is responsible for inhibiting protein
    synthesis through the catalytic inactivation of 60S ribosomal
    subunits.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endohydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond at one
    specific adenosine on the 28S rRNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Shiga toxin contains a single A-chain and five copies of
    B-chain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosome-inactivating protein family.
