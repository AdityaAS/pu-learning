AC   Q83H72;
Probable histidyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.21) (Histidine--tRNA
ligase) (HisRS).
"Sequencing and analysis of the genome of the Whipple's disease
bacterium Tropheryma whipplei.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-histidine + tRNA(His) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-histidyl-tRNA(His).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
