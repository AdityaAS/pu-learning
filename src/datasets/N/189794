AC   Q8R182; Q9EQI2;
Transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein 2 precursor (Proline-
rich Gla protein 2) (Proline-rich gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein
2) (NEDD4 WW domain-binding protein 1).
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Identification of multiple proteins expressed in murine embryos as
binding partners for the WW domains of the ubiquitin-protein ligase
Nedd4.";
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with NEDD4.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Gla residues are produced after subsequent posttranslational
    modifications of glutamate by a vitamin K-dependent gamma-
    carboxylase (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Gla (gamma-carboxy-glutamate) domain.
