Cytochrome b.
"Molecular evidence of an African Phiomorpha-South American
Caviomorpha clade and support for Hystricognathi based on the complete
mitochondrial genome of the cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus).";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase
    complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), which is a
    respiratory chain that generates an electrochemical potential
    coupled to ATP synthesis (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 heme groups non-covalently (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The main subunits of complex b-c1 are: cytochrome b,
    cytochrome c1 and the Rieske protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Heme 1 (or BL or b562) is low-potential and absorbs
    at about 562 nm, and heme 2 (or BH or b566) is high-potential and
    absorbs at about 566 nm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome b family.
