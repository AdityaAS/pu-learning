AC   Q5HQK0;
Argininosuccinate synthase (EC 6.3.4.5) (Citrulline--aspartate
ligase).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-citrulline + L-aspartate = AMP +
    diphosphate + omega-N-(L-arginino)succinate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-arginine biosynthesis; L-
    arginine from L-ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate: step 2.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the argininosuccinate synthase family. Type
    1 subfamily.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Arginine biosynthesis; ATP-binding;
Complete proteome; Ligase; Nucleotide-binding.
