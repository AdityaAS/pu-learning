AC   P30076;
Chalcone synthase 8 (EC 2.3.1.74) (Naringenin-chalcone synthase 8).
"Stress responses in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). 15.
Characterization and expression patterns of members of a subset of the
chalcone synthase multigene family.";
-!- FUNCTION: The primary product of this enzyme is 4,2',4',6'-
    tetrahydroxychalcone (also termed naringenin-chalcone or chalcone)
    which can under specific conditions spontaneously isomerize into
    naringenin.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3 malonyl-CoA + 4-coumaroyl-CoA = 4 CoA +
    naringenin chalcone + 3 CO(2).
-!- PATHWAY: Secondary metabolite biosynthesis; flavonoid
    biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chalcone/stilbene synthases family.
