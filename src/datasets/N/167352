U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (U1 snRNP protein C) (U1C
protein) (U1-C).
"Cloning and characterization of two processed pseudogenes and the
cDNA for the murine U1 snRNP-specific protein C.";
"Molecular cloning and developmental expression of a small ribonuclear
protein in the mouse testis.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is associated with snRNP U1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. In the testis, expressed in
    somatic and germinal testicular cells but not in elongated
    spermatids.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: First detected in the testis 18 days after
    birth. Levels increase successively between days 21-28. On day 42,
    levels decrease.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 matrin-type zinc finger.
Metal-binding; Nuclear protein; Phosphorylation; Ribonucleoprotein;
