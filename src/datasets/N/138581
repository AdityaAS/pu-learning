AC   P07691;
Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23) (OMP decarboxylase)
(OMPDCase) (OMPdecase).
"Cloning and characterization of the pyrF operon of Salmonella
typhimurium.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the decarboxylation of orotidine 5'-
    monophosphate (OMP) to uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Orotidine 5'-phosphate = UMP + CO(2).
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; UMP biosynthesis; UMP from
    HCO(3)(-): step 6 [final step].
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Pyrimidine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the OMP decarboxylase family. Type 1
    subfamily.
 GO:0006221; P:pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis; IEA:HAMAP.
