GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 precursor (EC 2.4.1.221)
(Peptide-O-fucosyltransferase 1) (O-FucT-1) (Neurotic protein).
"Neurotic, a novel maternal neurogenic gene, encodes an O-
fucosyltransferase that is essential for Notch-Delta interactions.";

-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reaction that attaches fucose through an
    O-glycosidic linkage to a conserved serine or threonine residue in
    EGF domains. Plays a crucial role in Notch signaling; essential
    for the interaction of Notch with its ligand Delta, and for the
    ability of Fringe to modulate this interaction.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Transfers an alpha-L-fucosyl residue from GDP-
    beta-L-fucose to the serine hydroxy group of a protein acceptor.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycosylation.
-!- INTERACTION:

    Q9VDI1:Synd; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-97485, EBI-106353;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum (By similarity).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed both maternally and zygotically.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 68 family.
