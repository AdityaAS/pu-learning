AC   O62768;
Thioredoxin reductase 1, cytoplasmic (EC 1.8.1.9) (TR) (TR1).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Thioredoxin + NADP(+) = thioredoxin disulfide
    + NADPH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Contains a selenide-sulfide bond between Cys-497 and Sec-498.
    This bond is speculated to serve as redox active pair (By
    similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The active site is a redox-active disulfide bond.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I pyridine nucleotide-disulfide
    oxidoreductase family.
