AC   Q6DLS0;
Renin precursor (EC 3.4.23.15) (Angiotensinogenase).
"Cloning and sequence analysis of cDNA for cynomolgus renin
precursor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Renin is a highly specific endopeptidase, whose only
    known function is to generate angiotensin I from angiotensinogen
    in the plasma, initiating a cascade of reactions that produce an
    elevation of blood pressure and increased sodium retention by the
    kidney (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cleavage of Leu-|-Xaa bond in angiotensinogen
    to generate angiotensin I.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Interaction with ATP6AP2 results in a 5-fold
    increased efficiency in angiotensinogen processing (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with ATP6AP2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity). Membrane
    (By similarity). Note=Associated to membranes via binding to
    ATP6AP2 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase A1 family.
