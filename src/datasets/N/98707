-!- FUNCTION: Tryptase is the major neutral protease present in mast
    cells and is secreted upon the coupled activation-degranulation
    response of this cell type.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Preferential cleavage: Arg-|-Xaa, Lys-|-Xaa,
    but with more restricted specificity than trypsin.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Long;
      IsoId=P21845-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Short;
      IsoId=P21845-2; Sequence=VSP_005376, VSP_005377;
      Note=Probably non functional;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase S1 family. Tryptase
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase S1 domain.
