AC   P16571;
Allophycocyanin beta chain.
"Genes encoding core components of the phycobilisome in the
cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. strain PCC 7601: occurrence of a
multigene family.";

    from the phycobiliprotein complex. Allophycocyanin has a maximum
    absorption at approximately 650 nanometers.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta chain.
-!- PTM: Contains one covalently linked phycocyanobilin chromophore
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phycobiliprotein family.
