AC   Q6CER3;
DASH complex subunit DAD1 (Outer kinetochore protein DAD1).
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the DASH complex, a microtubule-binding
    subcomplex of the outer kinetochore that is essential for proper
    chromosome segregation. The DASH complex mediates the formation
    and maintenance of bipolar kinetochore-microtubule attachments by
    forming closed rings around spindle microtubules and establishing
    interactions with proteins from the central kinetochore (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The DASH complex oligomerizes to form rings that encircle
    the microtubules (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity). Spindle (By
    similarity). Kinetochore (By similarity). Note=Associates with the
    mitotic spindle and the kinetochore (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DASH complex DAD1 family.
