AC   O33579;
Phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase (EC 1.8.4.8) (PAPS
reductase, thioredoxin dependent) (PAdoPS reductase) (3'-
phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase) (PAPS sulfotransferase) (Fragment).
"Isolation and sequencing of a second Rhizobium tropici CFN299 genetic
locus that contains genes homologous to amino acid sulphate activation
genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Reduction of activated sulfate into sulfite.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + sulfite +
    thioredoxin disulfide = 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + thioredoxin.
-!- PATHWAY: Sulfur metabolism; hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis; sulfite
    from sulfate: step 3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PAPS reductase family. CysH subfamily.
 GO:0019379; P:sulfate assimilation, phosphoadenylyl sulfa...; IEA:HAMAP.
