AC   Q02955;
Interleukin-1 receptor type I precursor (IL-1R-1) (p80) (CD121a
antigen).
"An mRNA homologous to interleukin-1 receptor type I is expressed in
cultured rat sympathetic ganglia.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1A), beta (IL-1B),
    and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1RA). Binding to
    the agonist leads to the activation of NF-kappa-B. Signaling
    involves formation of a ternary complex containing IL1RAP, TOLLIP,
    MYD88, and IRAK1 or IRAK2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds IL1RAP (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the interleukin-1 receptor family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 TIR domain.
