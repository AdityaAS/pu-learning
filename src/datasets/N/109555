AC   P18446;
Nucleocapsid protein (N structural protein) (NC).
"Sequence comparison of the N genes of five strains of the coronavirus
mouse hepatitis virus suggests a three domain structure for the
nucleocapsid protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Major structural component of virions that associates
    with genomic RNA to form a long, flexible, helical nucleocapsid.
    Interaction with the M protein leads to the formation of virus
    particles. Binds to cellular membranes and phospholipids. Elicits
    cell-mediated immunity. May play roles in viral transcription and
    translation, and/or replication.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer and oligomer. Both monomeric and oligomeric forms
    interact with RNA. Interacts with the M protein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Virion. Cell membrane. Note=Located inside
    the virion, complexed with the viral RNA. May be associated with
    cellular membranes where it participates in viral RNA synthesis
    and virus budding.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on serine residues (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the coronaviruses nucleocapsid protein
    family.
