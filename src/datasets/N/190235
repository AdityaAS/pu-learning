-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for TNFSF14/4-1BBL. Possibly active during T
    cell activation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with TRAF1, TRAF2 and TRAF3. Interacts with
    LRR-repeat protein 1/LRR-1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed on the surface of activated T-cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 TNFR-Cys repeats.
