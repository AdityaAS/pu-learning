member 3) (snoRNP protein NOP10).

-!- FUNCTION: Required for ribosome biogenesis and telomere
    maintenance. Part of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein
    (H/ACA snoRNP) complex, which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA.
    This involves the isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is
    subsequently attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Each rRNA
    can contain up to 100 pseudouridine ("psi") residues, which may
    serve to stabilize the conformation of rRNAs. May also be required
    for correct processing or intranuclear trafficking of TERC, the
    RNA component of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)
    holoenzyme.
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein
    (H/ACA snoRNP) complex, which contains NOLA2/NHP2, NOLA1/GAR1,
    NOLA3/NOP10, and DKC1/NOLA4, which is presumed to be the catalytic
    subunit. The complex contains a stable core formed by binding of
    one or two NOLA3-DKC1 heterodimers to NOLA2; NOLA1 subsequently
    binds to this core via DKC1. The complex binds a box H/ACA small
    nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), which may target the specific site of
    modification within the RNA substrate. The complex also interacts
    with TERC, which contains a 3'-terminal domain related to the box
    H/ACA snoRNAs. Specific interactions with snoRNAs or TERC are
    mediated by NOLA1 and NOLA2. Associates with NOLC1/NOPP140. H/ACA
    snoRNPs interact with the SMN complex, consisting of SMN1 or SMN2,
    SIP1/GEMIN2, DDX20/GEMIN3, and GEMIN4. This is mediated by
    interaction between GAR1 and SMN1 or SMN2. The SMN complex may be
    required for correct assembly of the H/ACA snoRNP complex.
