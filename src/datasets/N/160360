AC   P30058;
Plastid 30S ribosomal protein S8.
"Function and evolution of a minimal plastid genome from a
nonphotosynthetic parasitic plant.";
"Rapid evolution of the plastid translational apparatus in a
nonphotosynthetic plant: loss or accelerated sequence evolution of
tRNA and ribosomal protein genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly to 16S rRNA central domain where it helps coordinate
    assembly of the platform of the 30S subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S8P family.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
