AC   Q6MSN6;
50S ribosomal protein L24.
"The genome sequence of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC type
strain PG1T, the causative agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
(CBPP).";
-!- FUNCTION: One of two assembly inititator proteins, it binds
    directly to the 5' end of the 23S rRNA, where it nucleates
    assembly of the 50S subunit (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: One of the proteins that surrounds the polypeptide exit
    tunnel on the outside of the subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L24P family.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
