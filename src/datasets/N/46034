-!- FUNCTION: May have a role in process of intracellular digestion of
    proteins or in proteoglycan metabolism.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Appears abundant in
    chondrocytes and fetal brain.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in DYM are the cause of Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen
    syndrome (DMC) [MIM:223800]. DMC is a rare autosomal recessive
    disorder characterized by short trunk dwarfism, microcephaly and
    psychomotor retardation. Electron microscopic study of cutaneous
    cells of affected patients shows dilated rough endoplasmic
    reticulum, enlarged and aberrant vacuoles and numerous vesicles.
    DMC is progressive.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in DYM are the cause of Smith-McCort dysplasia
    (SMC) [MIM:607326]. SMC is a rare autosomal recessive
    osteochondrodysplasia characterized by short limbs and trunk with
    barrel-shaped chest. The radiographic phenotype includes
    platyspondyly, generalized abnormalities of the epiphyses and
    metaphyses, and a distinctive lacy appearance of the iliac crest,
    features identical to those of Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome.
