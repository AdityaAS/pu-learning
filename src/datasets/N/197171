AC   Q8SPH5;
Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex 11 kDa protein, mitochondrial
precursor (EC 1.10.2.2) (Mitochondrial hinge protein) (Cytochrome c1
nonheme 11 kDa protein) (Complex III subunit VIII).
"Search for genes positively selected during primate evolution by 5'-
end-sequence screening of cynomolgus monkey cDNAs.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c
    reductase complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), which
    is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein may
    mediate formation of the complex between cytochromes c and c1.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: QH(2) + 2 ferricytochrome c = Q + 2
    ferrocytochrome c.
-!- SUBUNIT: The bc1 complex contains 11 subunits; 3 respiratory
    subunits (cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, Rieske protein), 2 core
    proteins and 6 low-molecular weight proteins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UQCRH/QCR6 family.
