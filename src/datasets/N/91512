-!- FUNCTION: The PAF1 complex is a multifunctional complex. Involved
    in transcription initiation via genetic interactions with TATA-
    binding proteins. Involved in elongation. It regulates 3'-end
    formation of snR47 by modulating the recruitment or stable
    association of NRD1 and NAB3 with RNA polymerase II. Also has a
    role in transcription-coupled histone modification. Required for
    activation of RAD6 ubiquitin conjugate and the BRE1 ubiquitin
    ligase which ubiquitinate 'Lys-126' histone H2B. Activates the
    SET1 histone methyltransferase complex for methylation of 'Lys-4'
    of histone H3 and for methylation of 'Lys-73' of histone H3 by
    DOT1 and 'Lys-36' of histone H3 by SET2.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the PAF1 complex which consists of at least
    CDC73, CTR9, LEO1, PAF1 and RTF1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nucleoplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1110 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the LEO1 family.
