in the 200 kb rrnB-dnaB region.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Identification and characterization of a negative regulator of FtsZ
ring formation in Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Negative regulator of ftsZ ring formation; modulates the
    frequency and position of ftsZ ring formation. Inhibits ftsZ ring
    formation at polar sites. Interacts either with ftsZ or with one
    of its binding partners to promote depolymerization.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass membrane protein.
    Note=Colocalized with ftsZ to the nascent septal site.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ezrA family.
