AC   O88959; Q9R285;
Inhibin beta E chain precursor (Activin beta-E chain).
"Cloning and regulation of the rat activin betaE subunit.";
"Rat activin beta C and beta E: sequence and expression.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibins and activins inhibit and activate,
    respectively, the secretion of follitropin by the pituitary gland.
    Inhibins/activins are involved in regulating a number of diverse
    functions such as hypothalamic and pituitary hormone secretion,
    gonadal hormone secretion, germ cell development and maturation,
    erythroid differentiation, insulin secretion, nerve cell survival,
    embryonic axial development or bone growth, depending on their
    subunit composition. Inhibins appear to oppose the functions of
    activins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimeric or heterodimeric through association with
    alpha and beta subunits, linked by one or more disulfide bonds.
    Inhibins are heterodimers of one alpha and one beta subunit.
    Activins are homo- or heterodimers of beta subunits only (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TGF-beta family.
