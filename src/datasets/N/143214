AC   Q5LDK8;
Recombination protein recR.
"Extensive DNA inversions in the B. fragilis genome control variable
gene expression.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play a role in DNA repair. It seems to be involved
    in an recBC-independent recombinational process of DNA repair. It
    may act with recF and recO (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the recR family.
