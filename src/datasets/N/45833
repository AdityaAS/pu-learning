1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (EC 1.1.1.267) (DXP
reductoisomerase) (1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase) (2-C-
methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate synthase).
"Tropheryma whipplei twist: a human pathogenic Actinobacteria with a
reduced genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the NADP-dependent rearrangement and reduction
    of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
    4-phosphate (MEP) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate + NADP(+)
    = 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate + NADPH.
-!- COFACTOR: Divalent cation (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; isopentenyl-PP biosynthesis via
    DXP pathway; isopentenyl-PP from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:
    step 1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DXR family.
