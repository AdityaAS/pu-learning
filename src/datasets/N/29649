AC   Q8EI18;
Nicotinate-nucleotide--dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase
(EC 2.4.2.21) (NN:DBI PRT) (N(1)-alpha-phosphoribosyltransferase).
"Genome sequence of the dissimilatory metal ion-reducing bacterium
Shewanella oneidensis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the synthesis of alpha-ribazole-5'-phosphate
    from nicotinate mononucleotide (NAMN) and 5,6-
    dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Beta-nicotinate D-ribonucleotide +
    dimethylbenzimidazole = nicotinate + 1-N-(5-phospho-alpha-D-
    ribosyl)-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole.
-!- PATHWAY: Cobalamin biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cobT family.
 GO:0015420; F:cobalamin-transporting ATPase activity; IEA:HAMAP.
