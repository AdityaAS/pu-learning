AC   P16417;
Hemoglobin subunit alpha-D (Hemoglobin alpha-D chain) (Alpha-D-
globin).
"The amino acid sequences of the alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin
from the snake, Liophis miliaris.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in oxygen transport from the lung to the
    various peripheral tissues.
-!- SUBUNIT: The deoxy-Hb is a heterotetramer of two alpha and two
    beta chains, but oxygenation results in dissociation to dimers.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Red blood cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the globin family.
Direct protein sequencing; Heme; Iron; Metal-binding;
