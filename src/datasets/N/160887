AC   P53256; Q6TQU1;
Exosome complex exonuclease RRP46 (EC 3.1.13.-) (Ribosomal RNA-
processing protein 46).
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII.";
"The yeast exosome and human PM-Scl are related complexes of 3'-->5'
exonucleases.";
"Sequencing and comparison of yeast species to identify genes and
regulatory elements.";
"Global analysis of protein localization in budding yeast.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the exosome 3'->5' exoribonuclease complex.
    Required for the 3' processing of the 7S pre-RNA to the mature
    5.8S rRNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the exosome multienzyme ribonuclease complex
    composed of at least 11 proteins: RRP4, RRP40, RRP41/SKI6, RRP42,
    RRP43, RRP44/DIS3, RRP45, RRP46, MTR3, CSL4 and RRP6 (only in the
    nuclear complex). Also associated with the GTPase Ran (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus; nucleolus.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 10800 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNase PH family.
