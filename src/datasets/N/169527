AC   O68032;
Nuclease sbcCD subunit C.
"Sequence of a 189-kb segment of the chromosome of Rhodobacter
capsulatus SB1003.";
-!- FUNCTION: SbcCD cleaves DNA hairpin structures. These structures
    can inhibit DNA replication and are intermediates in certain DNA
    recombination reactions. The complex acts as a 3'->5' double
    strand exonuclease that can open hairpins. It also has a 5'
    single-strand endonuclease activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of sbcC and sbcD (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SMC family. SbcC subfamily.
