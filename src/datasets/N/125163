"PIGEA-14, a novel coiled-coil protein affecting the intracellular
distribution of polycystin-2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits the Wnt/Wingless pathway by binding to beta-
    catenin and inhibiting beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional
    activation by competing with TCF/LEF transcription factors. Has
    also been shown to play a role in regulating the intracellular
    trafficking of polycystin-2/PKD2 and possibly of other
    intracellular proteins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer; interacts with polycystin-2/PKD2 and GM130.
    Interacts with the C-terminal region of beta-catenin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nuclear speckle. Golgi apparatus;
    trans-Golgi network. Note=Nuclear, in a punctate manner. Also
    found in the trans-Golgi.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Expressed at higher levels
    in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and placenta. Also found in
    brain, lung, liver and testis. Significantly down-regulated in
    thyroid and metastatic uterine tumors.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Chibby is Japanese for 'small'; the gene was so
    named for the RNAi phenotype seen in flies.
