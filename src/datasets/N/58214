AC   Q659L1;
Alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.-) (Galactoside 3-L-
fucosyltransferase) (Fucosyltransferase 9) (FUCT-IX).
"Phylogeny of fucosyltransferases.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transfers a fucose to lacto-N-neotetraose but not to
    either alpha2,3-sialyl lacto-N-neotetraose or lacto-N-tetraose.
    Can catalyze the last step in the biosynthesis of Lewis antigen,
    the addition of a fucose to precursor polysaccharides (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Glycosylation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack; Golgi stack
    membrane; single-pass type II membrane protein (By similarity).
    Note=Membrane-bound form in trans cisternae of Golgi (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 10 family.
