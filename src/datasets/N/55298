AC   Q98HE3;
Flagellar basal-body rod protein flgF.
"Complete genome structure of the nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacterium
Mesorhizobium loti.";
-!- SUBUNIT: The basal body constitutes a major portion of the
    flagellar organelle and consists of five rings (E,L,P,S, and M)
    mounted on a central rod. The rod consists of about 26 subunits of
    flgG in the distal portion, and flgB, flgC and flgF are thought to
    build up the proximal portion of the rod with about 6 subunits
    each (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the flagella basal body rod proteins
    family.
Complete proteome; Flagellum.
