Signal peptidase complex subunit SPC1 (Microsomal signal peptidase
subunit 1).
"The homologue of mammalian SPC12 is important for efficient signal
peptidase activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"Complete nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
X.";
"Creation of the YFLEX clone resource: cloning of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae ORFs in the Gateway recombinational cloning system.";
"The yeast SPC22/23 homolog Spc3p is essential for signal peptidase
activity.";
"Interactions between Spc2p and other components of the endoplasmic
reticulum translocation sites of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Nonessential component of the signal peptidase complex
    (SPC), which catalyzes the cleavage of N-terminal signal sequences
    of proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Signal peptide
    cleavage occurs during the translocation (cotranslationally or
    posttranslationally) through the translocon pore into the
    endoplasmic reticulum. SPC3 is not required for signal peptidase
    activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the signal peptidase complex (SPC), which
    consists of SPC1, SPC2, SPC3 and SEC11. SPC associates with the
    translocon complex. SPC1 interacts with SBH1 and SEB2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 5550 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SPCS1 family.
