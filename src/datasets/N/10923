AC   Q57AM8;
Shikimate kinase (EC 2.7.1.71) (SK).
"Completion of the genome sequence of Brucella abortus and comparison
to the highly similar genomes of Brucella melitensis and Brucella
suis.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + shikimate = ADP + shikimate 3-phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; chorismate
    biosynthesis; chorismate from D-erythrose 4-phosphate and PEP:
    step 5.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Aromatic amino acids biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the shikimate kinase family.
