G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (EC 2.7.11.16) (G protein-coupled
receptor kinase GRK6).
"Molecular cloning of rat G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6)
from brain tissue, and its mRNA expression in different brain regions
and peripheral tissues.";
-!- FUNCTION: Specifically phosphorylates the activated forms of G
    protein-coupled receptors (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + [G-protein-coupled receptor] = ADP + [G-
    protein-coupled receptor] phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; lipid-anchor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. GPRK
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RGS domain.
