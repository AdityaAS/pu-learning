AC   P47844;
Carbonyl reductase [NADPH] 1 (EC 1.1.1.184) (NADPH-dependent carbonyl
reductase 1).
"Cloning and expression of the cDNA encoding rabbit liver carbonyl
reductase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reduction of a wide variety of carbonyl
    compounds including the antitumor anthracycline antibiotics.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: R-CHOH-R' + NADP(+) = R-CO-R' + NADPH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Present in liver and kidney.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases
    (SDR) family.
