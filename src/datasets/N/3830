-!- FUNCTION: Mediates odorant detection (possibly) via modulation of
    intracellular cAMP concentration.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP = 3',5'-cyclic AMP + diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by calcium/calmodulin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in brain, heart, kidney, liver,
    lung, pancreas, placenta, and skeletal muscle.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adenylyl cyclase class-4/guanylyl
    cyclase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 guanylate cyclase domains.
