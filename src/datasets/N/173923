AC   O93724;
Superoxide dismutase [Fe] (EC 1.15.1.1).
"Genome sequence of the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum
aerophilum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Destroys radicals which are normally produced within the
    cells and which are toxic to biological systems.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 superoxide + 2 H(+) = O(2) + H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 iron ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the iron/manganese superoxide dismutase
    family.
3D-structure; Complete proteome; Iron; Metal-binding; Oxidoreductase.
