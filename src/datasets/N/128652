-!- FUNCTION: Protein 2A is implicated in RNA2 replication. Could also
    be required for nematode transmission of the virus.
-!- FUNCTION: The movement protein is assembled into tubules that
    allow the transport of virions from cell to cell.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell junction; plasmodesma. Note=Viral
    movement proteins assembled in tubules are embedded within
    modified plasmodesmata. Movement proteins are targeted
    preferentially to calreticulin-labeled foci within the youngest
    cross walls, where they assemble into tubules. During cell
    division, they colocalize in the cell plate with KNOLLE, a
    cytokinesis-specific syntaxin. Protein 2A is cytoplasmic early in
    infection. Later in infection, it becomes progressively
    concentrated around the nucleus, where it forms large aggregates.
-!- PTM: Specific enzymatic cleavages in vivo by the P1 encoded 3C-
    like protease yield mature proteins.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Virions are comprised of 60 copies of the coat
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nepoviruses RNA2 polyprotein family.
