-!- FUNCTION: The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex
    which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg,
    Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or
    slightly basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic
    activity.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cleavage of peptide bonds with very broad
    specificity.
-!- SUBUNIT: The proteasome is composed of at least 15 non identical
    subunits which form a highly ordered ring-shaped structure. The
    26S proteasome consisting of a 20S core protease (CP) complex
    capped at one or both ends by a 19S regulatory particle (RP). The
    CP has a cylindrical shape composed by 4 heptameric rings made of
    alpha and beta subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase T1A family.
