AC   O24143;
NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 8, mitochondrial
precursor (EC 1.6.5.3) (EC 1.6.99.3) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase
23 kDa subunit) (Complex I-23kD) (CI-23kD) (Complex I-28.5kD) (CI-
28.5kD).
"The 28.5-kDa iron-sulfur protein of mitochondrial complex I is
encoded in the nucleus in plants.";
-!- FUNCTION: May donate electrons to ubiquinone.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone = NAD(+) + ubiquinol.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + acceptor = NAD(+) + reduced acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 4Fe-4S clusters per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex I is composed of about 40 different subunits.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I 23 kDa subunit family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
