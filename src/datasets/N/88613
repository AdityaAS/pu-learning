Kinetochore protein Hec1 (Kinetochore-associated protein 2).
"Dynamic behavior of Nuf2-Hec1 complex that localizes to the
centrosome and centromere and is essential for mitotic progression in
vertebrate cells.";
"Full-length cDNAs from chicken bursal lymphocytes to facilitate gene
function analysis.";
"The functional region of CENP-H interacts with the Nuf2 complex that
localizes to centromere during mitosis.";
"CENP-A is required for accurate chromosome segregation and sustained
kinetochore association of BubR1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts as a component of the essential kinetochore-
    associated NDC80 complex, which is required for chromosome
    segregation and spindle checkpoint activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the NDC80 complex, which is composed of at
    least KNTC2/HEC1 and CDCA1. Interacts with CENPH.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q90ZF9:CENP-H; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1003779, EBI-1003677;
    Q76I90:Nuf2; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-1003779, EBI-1003866;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Kinetochore. Centrosome.
    Note=Localizes to kinetochores from late prophase to anaphase and
    to the centrosome during G1 and S phase.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NDC80/HEC1 family.
