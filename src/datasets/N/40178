AC   Q8TFK8; Q6FLJ6;
ATP-dependent RNA helicase DED1 (EC 3.6.1.-).
"Genomic differences between Candida glabrata and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae around the MRPL28 and GCN3 loci.";
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: ATP-binding RNA helicase involved in translation
    initiation. Remodels RNA in response to ADP and ATP concentrations
    by facilitating disruption, but also formation of RNA duplexes (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The Q motif is unique to and characteristic of the DEAD
    box family of RNA helicases and controls ATP binding and
    hydrolysis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DEAD box helicase family. DDX3/DED1
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase C-terminal domain.
