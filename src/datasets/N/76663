AC   P31778;
Regulatory protein hrpB.
"Evidence that the hrpB gene encodes a positive regulator of
pathogenicity genes from Pseudomonas solanacearum.";
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Positive regulation of hypersensitive response genes
    involved in plant pathogenicity and partly of its own synthesis in
    minimal medium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HTH araC/xylS-type DNA-binding domain.
