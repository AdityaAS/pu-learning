AC   Q9CP58;
Fumarate reductase subunit C.
"Complete genomic sequence of Pasteurella multocida Pm70.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to be involved in the anchoring of the catalytic
    components of the fumarate reductase complex to the cytoplasmic
    membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of an enzyme complex containing four subunits: a
    flavoprotein (frdA), an iron-sulfur protein (frdB), and two
    hydrophobic anchor proteins (frdC and frdD) (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the frdC family.
Complete proteome; Inner membrane; Membrane; Transmembrane.
