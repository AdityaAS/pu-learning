AC   P60777; Q8XB31;
Protein smp precursor.
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the smp family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 and Ref.2 sequences differ from that shown due to a
    missing stop codon that produces one ORF, which contains smp and
    lplA.
