AC   Q8CU52;
Alkylmercury lyase (EC 4.99.1.2) (Organomercurial lyase).
"Genome-based analysis of virulence genes in a non-biofilm-forming
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain (ATCC 12228).";
-!- FUNCTION: Cleaves the carbon-mercury bond of organomercurials such
    as phenylmercuric acetate. One product is Hg(2+), which is
    subsequently detoxified by the mercuric reductase (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: RHg(+) + H(+) = RH + Hg(2+).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the merB family.
 GO:0046689; P:response to mercury ion; IEA:HAMAP.
