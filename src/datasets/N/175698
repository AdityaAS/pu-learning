-!- FUNCTION: Functions as component of the transcription regulatory
    histone acetylation (HAT) complexes SAGA, SALSA and SLIK. SAGA is
    involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation
    of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is
    required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It
    influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through
    different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and
    SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription
    activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification
    through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8).
    SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent at 'Lys-9',
    'Lys-14', 'Lys-18' and 'Lys-23'. SAGA interacts with DNA via
    upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of
    SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SPT3
    is required for recruitment of TATA-binding protein (TBP) to SAGA-
    dependent promoters. During SAGA-mediated transcriptional
    inhibition, SPT3 and SPT8 prevent binding of TBP to the TATA box.
    SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.
    It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after
    activation at the GAL1-10 locus. SPT factors 3, 7 and 8 are
    required for the initiation of Ty transcription from the delta
    promoter. SPT3 regulates Ty1 as well as the mating factor genes.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the 1.8 MDa SAGA complex, which consists of
    at least of TRA1, CHD1, SPT7, TAF5, ADA3, SGF73, SPT20/ADA5, SPT8,
    TAF12, TAF6, HFI1/ADA1, UBP8, GCN5, ADA2, SPT3, SGF29, TAF10,
    TAF9, SGF11 and SUS1. TAF5, TAF6, TAF9, TAF19, TAF12 and ADA1 seem
    to be present in 2 copies. SAGA is built of 5 distinct domains
    with specialized functions. Domain I (containing TRA1) probably
    represents the activator interaction surface. Domain II
    (containing TAF5 and TAF6, and probably TAF9 and TAF10), domain
    III (containing GCN5, TAF10, SPT7, TAF5 and ADA1, and probably
    ADA2, ADA3 and TAF12), and domain IV (containing HFI1/ADA1 and
    TAF6, and probably TAF9) are believed to play primarily an
    architectural role. Domain III also harbors the HAT activity.
    Domain V (containing SPT3 and SPT20, and probably SPT8) represents
    the TBP-interacting module, which may be associated transiently
    with SAGA. SPT3 interacts directly with TBP (TATA-binding
    protein). Component of the SALSA complex, which consists of at
    least TRA1, SPT7 (C-terminal truncated form), TAF5, ADA3, SPT20,
    TAF12, TAF6, HFI1, GCN5, ADA2 and SPT3. Component of the SLIK
    complex, which of at least TRA1, CHD1, SPT7, TAF5, ADA3, SPT20,
    RTG2, TAF12, TAF6, HFI1, UBP8, GCN5, ADA2, SPT3, SGF29, TAF10 and
    TAF9.
