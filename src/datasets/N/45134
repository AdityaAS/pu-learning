AC   O66742;
D-tyrosyl-tRNA(Tyr) deacylase (EC 3.1.-.-).
"The complete genome of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex
aeolicus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Hydrolyzes D-tyrosyl-tRNA(Tyr) into D-tyrosine and free
    tRNA(Tyr). Could be a defense mechanism against a harmful effect
    of D-tyrosine (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DTD family.
