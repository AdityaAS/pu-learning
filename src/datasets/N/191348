Taste receptor type 2 member 103 (T2R103) (Taste receptor type 2
member 10) (T2R10) (Taste receptor family B member 2) (TRB2).

-!- FUNCTION: Gustducin-coupled receptor implicated in the perception
    of bitter compounds in the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal
    tract. Signals through PLCB2 and the calcium-regulated cation
    channel TRPM5.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells
    of the tongue and palate epithelium and exclusively in gustducin-
    positive cells. Expressed in 15% taste bud cells in circumvallate
    and foliate papillae but only in 2% in fungiform papillae.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Several bitter taste receptors are expressed in a
    single taste receptor cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor T2R family.
