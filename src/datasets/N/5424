-!- FUNCTION: In higher plants aldehyde oxidases (AO) appear to be
    homo- and heterodimeric assemblies of AO subunits with probably
    different physiological functions. AO-alpha may be involved in the
    biosynthesis of auxin, and in biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA)
    in seeds. In vitro, AO-alpha uses heptaldehyde,
    protocatechualdehyde, benzaldehyde, indole-3-aldehyde (IAld),
    indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld), cinnamaldehyde and citral as
    substrates; AO-beta uses IAAld, IAld and naphtaldehyde as
    substrates.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: An aldehyde + H(2)O + O(2) = a carboxylic acid
    + H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 2Fe-2S clusters (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Molybdopterin (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Strongly inhibited by iodoacetate and potassium
    cyanide (KCN). Weakly inhibited by 2-mercaptoethanol,
    dithiothreitol (DTT), menadione, estradiol, 4'-(9-
    acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidine (mAMSA), allopurinol and
    tritonX-100. Not affected by p-chloromercuribenzoate.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:

      KM=19 uM for protocatechualdehyde;
      KM=0.74 uM for benzaldehyde;
      KM=4.4 uM for indole-3-aldehyde;
      KM=39 uM for indole-3-acetaldehyde;
      KM=20 uM for cinnamaldehyde;
      KM=22 uM for citral;
      Vmax=7.1 nmol/min/mg enzyme with heptaldehyde as substrate;
      Vmax=8.0 nmol/min/mg enzyme with protocatechualdehyde as
      substrate;
      Vmax=17 nmol/min/mg enzyme with benzaldehyde as substrate;
      Vmax=6.9 nmol/min/mg enzyme with IAld as substrate;
      Vmax=7.3 nmol/min/mg enzyme with IAAld as substrate;
      Vmax=3.8 nmol/min/mg enzyme with cinnamaldehyde as substrate;
      Vmax=38 nmol/min/mg enzyme with citral as substrate;
      Note=Kinetic values were obtained with the AO-alpha dimer;
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 8;
    Temperature dependence:
      Optimum temperature is 65 degrees Celsius;
-!- SUBUNIT: Aldehyde oxidases (AO) are homo- and heterodimers of AO
    subunits. AO-alpha is an AAO1 homodimer; AO-beta is an AAO1-AAO2
    heterodimer.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominantly expressed in roots, seedlings,
    mature siliques and seeds, and to lower extent in stems and
    rosettes. In seedlings, mostly expressed in lower part of
    hypocotyls and roots.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the xanthine dehydrogenase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain.
