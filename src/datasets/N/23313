AC   Q7ZX42;
Cell division protein kinase 9-B (EC 2.7.11.22) (EC 2.7.11.23)
(Cyclin-dependent kinase 9-B).
-!- FUNCTION: Member of the cyclin-dependent kinase pair (CDK9/cyclin-
    T) complex, also called positive transcription elongation factor B
    (P-TEFb), which is proposed to facilitate the transition from
    abortive to production elongation by phosphorylating the CTD (C-
    terminal domain) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP
    II) and SUPT5H (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + [DNA-directed RNA polymerase] = ADP +
    [DNA-directed RNA polymerase] phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Associates with cyclin-T to form P-TEFb (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
    CDC2/CDKX subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
