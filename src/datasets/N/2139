AC   Q10715;
Angiotensin-converting enzyme precursor (EC 3.4.15.1) (Dipeptidyl
carboxypeptidase I) (Kininase II).
"Cloning and characterisation of angiotensin-converting enzyme from
the dipteran species, Haematobia irritans exigua, and its expression
in the maturing male reproductive system.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the specific maturation or degradation of a
    number of bioactive peptides.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Release of a C-terminal dipeptide,
    oligopeptide-|-Xaa-Yaa, when Xaa is not Pro, and Yaa is neither
    Asp nor Glu. Thus, conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II,
    with increase in vasoconstrictor activity, but no action on
    angiotensin II.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein; extracellular space
    (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the compound ganglion and in the
    posterior region of the midgut.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M2 family.
