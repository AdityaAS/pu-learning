AC   Q7N807;
Ribonuclease H (EC 3.1.26.4) (RNase H).
"The genome sequence of the entomopathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus
luminescens.";
-!- FUNCTION: Endonuclease that specifically degrades the RNA of RNA-
    DNA hybrids (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage to 5'-
    phosphomonoester.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit. May bind a second
    metal ion at a regulatory site, or after substrate binding (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNase H family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RNase H domain.
