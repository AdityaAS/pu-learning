AC   Q98F76;
Holliday junction ATP-dependent DNA helicase ruvB (EC 3.6.1.-).
"Complete genome structure of the nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacterium
Mesorhizobium loti.";
-!- FUNCTION: The ruvA-ruvB complex in the presence of ATP renatures
    cruciform structure in supercoiled DNA with palindromic sequence,
    indicating that it may promote strand exchange reactions in
    homologous recombination. RuvAB is an helicase that mediates the
    Holliday junction migration by localized denaturation and
    reannealing (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a complex with ruvA (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ruvB family.
