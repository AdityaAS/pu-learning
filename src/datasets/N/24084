Complement factor B (EC 3.4.21.47) (C3/C5 convertase) (Properdin
factor B) (Fragment).
"Cloning and sequencing of the porcine complement factor B.";
-!- FUNCTION: Factor B which is part of the alternate pathway of the
    complement system is cleaved by factor D into 2 fragments: Ba and
    Bb. Bb, a serine protease, then combines with complement factor 3b
    to generate the C3 or C5 convertase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cleavage of Arg-|-Ser bond in complement
    component C3 alpha-chain to yield C3a and C3b, and Arg-|-Xaa bond
    in complement component C5 alpha-chain to yield C5a and C5b.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase S1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Sushi (CCP/SCR) domains.
