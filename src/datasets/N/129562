Protein phosphatase 2C isoform delta (EC 3.1.3.16) (PP2C-delta) (p53-
induced protein phosphatase 1) (Protein phosphatase magnesium-
dependent 1 delta).
"The structure and expression of the murine wildtype p53-induced
phosphatase 1 (Wip1) gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the relief of p53-dependent checkpoint
    mediated cell cycle arrest. Binds to and dephosphorylates 'Ser-18'
    of TP53 and 'Ser-345' of CHEK1 which contributes to the functional
    inactivation of these proteins (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A phosphoprotein + H(2)O = a protein +
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium or manganese ions per subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with CHEK1 (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitously expressed.
-!- INDUCTION: By p53.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PP2C family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PP2C-like domain.
