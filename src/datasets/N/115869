NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 49 kDa subunit (EC 1.6.5.3)
(EC 1.6.99.3) (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 7) (Complex I-42.5kD) (CI-
42.5kD) (Fragment).
"The 42.5 kDa subunit of the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex
I) in higher plants is encoded by the mitochondrial nad7 gene.";
"Purification of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the
respiratory chain from the inner mitochondrial membrane of Solanum
tuberosum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory
    chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed
    to be ubiquinone. Component of the iron-sulfur (IP) fragment of
    the enzyme.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone = NAD(+) + ubiquinol.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + acceptor = NAD(+) + reduced acceptor.
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex I is composed of about 30 different subunits.
    This is a component of the iron-sulfur protein fraction.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    matrix side.
-!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=12, 25, 27.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I 49 kDa subunit family.
