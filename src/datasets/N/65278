AC   Q9KTJ4;
D,D-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.-) (D-glycero-D-
manno-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate phosphatase).
"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
"Novel pathways for biosynthesis of nucleotide-activated glycero-
manno-heptose precursors of bacterial glycoproteins and cell surface
polysaccharides.";
-!- FUNCTION: Converts the D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1,7-
    bisphosphate intermediate into D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1-
    phosphate by removing the phosphate group at the C-7 position (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1,7-
    bisphosphate + H(2)O = D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate
    + phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Inner core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis; ADP-L-
    glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose biosynthesis; third step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This enzyme is insensitive to the anomeric
    configuration of the D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gmhB family.
