AC   Q8BQN6; Q9Z0Q5;
Zinc finger protein OZF (Only zinc finger protein) (Zinc finger
protein 146).
"Cloning, characterization, and chromosome assignment of Zfp146 the
mouse ortholog of human ZNF146, a gene amplified and overexpressed in
pancreatic cancer, and Zfp260 a closely related gene.";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"Targeted expression of the only zinc finger gene in transgenic mice
is associated with impaired mammary development.";
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds DNA. Interacts with SUMO conjugating enzyme
    UBC9/UBE2I. Interacts with the telomeric protein TERF2IP (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in heart, brain, liver, lung,
    skeletal muscle and kidney, and at much lower level in spleen and
    testicle. Expressed in lactating mammary gland.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Mice lacking Zfp146 in mammary gland display
    impaired mammary gland development. They cannot sustain full
    growth of their pups. This phenotype is associated with an
    impaired mammary gland development noticeable only after mid-
    gestation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the krueppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 10 C2H2-type zinc fingers.
DNA-binding; Metal-binding; Nuclear protein; Repeat; Ubl conjugation;
