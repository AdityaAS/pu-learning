-!- FUNCTION: This enzyme condenses acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to
    form HMG-CoA, which is the substrate for HMG-CoA reductase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + H(2)O + acetoacetyl-CoA = (S)-3-
    hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA + CoA.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; mevalonate
    biosynthesis; R-mevalonate from acetyl-CoA: step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Ketone body biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Liver and kidney.
-!- PTM: Acetylation of Lys-427 is observed in liver mitochondria from
    fasted mice but not from fed mice.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HMG-CoA synthase family.
