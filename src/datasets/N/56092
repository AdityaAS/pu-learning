AC   P14190;
K88 fimbrial protein AC precursor (K88 pilin) (K88 antigen).
"Nucleotide sequences of four variants of the K88 gene of porcine
enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.";
"The nucleotide sequence of the protein subunit of the K88ac fimbriae
of porcine enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.";
"Cloning of DNA sequences encoding foreign peptides and their
expression in the K88 pili.";
-!- FUNCTION: K88 major fimbrial subunit. Fimbriae (also called pili),
    are polar filaments radiating from the surface of the bacterium to
    a length of 0.5-1.5 micrometers and numbering 100-300 per cell.
    They enable bacteria to colonize the epithelium of specific host
    organs.
-!- SUBUNIT: K88 fimbria, 0.1-1 micrometer in length and 7 nanometers
    in diameter, is composed of about 100 identical subunits.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The protein exists in several antigenic variants.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fimbrial K88 protein family.
