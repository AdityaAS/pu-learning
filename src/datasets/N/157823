DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit D (EC 2.7.7.6) (DNA-directed RNA
polymerase I 16 kDa polypeptide) (RPA16).

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription
    of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as
    substrates. RNA polymerase I is essentially used to transcribe
    ribosomal DNA units.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: Each class of RNA polymerase is assembled from 9 to 14
    different polypeptides.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are
    found in eukaryotic nuclei: polymerase I for the ribosomal RNA
    precursor, polymerase II for the mRNA precursor, and polymerase
    III for 5S and tRNA genes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the archaeal rpoL/eukaryotic RPB11/RPC19
    RNA polymerase subunit family.
