AC   O23878;
13S globulin seed storage protein 1 precursor (Legumin-like protein 1)
[Contains: 13S globulin seed storage protein 1 acidic chain; 13S
globulin seed storage protein 1 basic chain].
"Expression, cloning, and immunological analysis of buckwheat
(Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) seed storage proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seed storage protein.
-!- SUBUNIT: Hexamer; each subunit is composed of an acidic and a
    basic chain derived from a single precursor and linked by a
    disulfide bond (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed only in immatures seeds.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed between 7 and 28 days after
    pollination.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The sequence of the probable beta chain is highly
    homologous to the N-terminal sequence of BW24KD, a major buckwheat
    allergen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 11S seed storage protein (globulins)
    family.
