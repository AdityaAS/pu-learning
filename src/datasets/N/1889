AC   O52058;
Biotin carboxylase (EC 6.3.4.14) (Acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunit A)
(EC 6.4.1.2) (ACC) (Fragment).
"Molecular genetic evidence for extracytoplasmic localization of
sulfur globules in Chromatium vinosum.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is a component of the acetyl coenzyme A
    carboxylase complex; first, biotin carboxylase catalyzes the
    carboxylation of the carrier protein and then the transcarboxylase
    transfers the carboxyl group to form malonyl-CoA (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + biotin-carboxyl-carrier protein + CO(2)
    = ADP + phosphate + carboxybiotin-carboxyl-carrier protein.
-!- PATHWAY: Long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis; first step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is an heterohexamer of biotin
    carboxyl carrier protein, biotin carboxylase and the two subunits
    of carboxyl transferase in a 2:2 complex (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 biotin carboxylation domain.
