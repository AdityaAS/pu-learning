-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway,
    probably by acting as a coreceptor together with Frizzled for Wnt
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with different Wnt/Frizzled complexes.
    Interacts with axin (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=1;
      Comment=A number of isoforms are produced;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q91VN0-1; Sequence=Displayed;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed, with the highest expression
    levels in liver, heart, and lung and the lowest levels in brain
    and spleen.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed before or on embryonic day 7.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylation of the PPPSP motif creates an inducible
    docking site for axin (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the LDLR family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 EGF-like domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 LDL-receptor class A domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 20 LDL-receptor class B repeats.
