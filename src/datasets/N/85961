1) (Phosphohexokinase) (Phosphofructo-1-kinase isozyme B) (PFK-B).
"Rat-liver-type phosphofructokinase mRNA. Structure, tissue
distribution and regulation.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + D-fructose 6-phosphate = ADP + D-
    fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Allosteric enzyme activated by ADP, AMP, or
    fructose bisphosphate and inhibited by ATP or citrate.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; D-glyceraldehyde 3-
    phosphate and glycerone phosphate from D-glucose: step 3.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphofructokinase family. Two domains
    subfamily.
