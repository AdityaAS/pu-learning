-!- FUNCTION: Together with Cas it may play a role in the control of
    epithelial cell polarity. Seems to help to recruit protein
    tyrosine kinase 2 beta (PTK2B) to cell matrix adhesions, thereby
    initiating phosphorylation of PTK2B and PTK2B-dependent signaling
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with Crk-associated substrate (Cas), NPHP4,
    PTK2B and tensin. Interacts with INVS and NPHP3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell junction; adherens junction (By
    similarity). Note=Localizes at or near the cell-cell adherens
    junctions (By similarity).

      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widespread expression, with highest levels in
    pituitary gland, spinal cord, thyroid gland, testis, skeletal
    muscle, lymph node and trachea. Weakly expressed in heart, kidney
    and pancreas.
-!- DOMAIN: The SH3 domain mediates the stable interaction with Cas
    (By similarity).
-!- DISEASE: Defects in NPHP1 are the cause of familial juvenile
    nephronophthisis 1 (NPHP1) [MIM:256100]. NPHP1 is an autosomal
    recessive inherited disease characterized by anemia, polyuria,
    polydipsia, isosthenuria and death in uremia. Symmetrical
    destruction of the kidneys involving both tubules and glomeruli
    occurs. The underlying pathology is a chronic tubulo-interstitial
    nephropathy with characteristic tubular basement membrane
    thickening and medullary cyst formation. Associations with
    extrarenal symptoms, especially ocular lesions, are frequent. The
    age at death ranges from about 4 to 15 years.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in NPHP1 are the cause of Senior-Loken syndrome 1
    (SLSN1) [MIM:266900]. Senior-Loken syndrome (SLSN) is also known
    as juvenile nephronophthisis with Leber amaurosis. It is an
    autosomal recessive renal-retinal disorder characterized by
    progressive wasting of the filtering unit of the kidney, with or
    without medullary cystic renal disease, and progressive eye
    disease. Typically this disorder becomes apparent during the first
    year of life.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in NPHP1 are the cause of Joubert syndrome 4
    (JBTS4) [MIM:609583]. Joubert syndrome is an autosomal recessive
    multisystem disease characterized by cerebellar vermis hypoplasia
    with prominent superior cerebellar peduncles (the "molar tooth
    sign" on axial magnetic resonance imaging), mental retardation,
    hypotonia, irregular breathing pattern, and eye-movement
    abnormalities. Some individuals have retinal dystrophy and/or
    progressive renal failure characterized by nephronophthisis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nephrocystin-1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SH3 domain.
