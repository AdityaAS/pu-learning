Zinc-finger protein ubi-d4 (Requiem) (Apoptosis response zinc finger
protein) (D4, zinc and double PHD fingers family 2).
"Structure and expression of two members of the d4 gene family in
mouse.";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Requiem: a novel zinc finger gene essential for apoptosis in myeloid
cells.";
"Expression and chromosomal localization of the Requiem gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be a transcription factor required for the apoptosis
    response following survival factor withdrawal from myeloid cells.
    Might also have a role in the development and maturation of
    lymphoid cells.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: In embryo, highest levels are seen in brain,
    eyes, thymus and olfactory epithelium in nose, whereas several
    other tissues, including the musculoskeletal system, show moderate
    expression. In adult, higher expression in testis, medium in
    thymus and spleen, lower in certain parts of the brain as the
    hippocampus. No expression in adult heart, lung, liver, duodenum
    and kidney.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Already detected at embryonic day 8.5.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the requiem/DPF family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 C2H2-type zinc finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 PHD-type zinc fingers.
