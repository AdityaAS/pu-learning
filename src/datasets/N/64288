AC   O69664;
Glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30) (ATP:glycerol 3-phosphotransferase)
(Glycerokinase) (GK).
"Deciphering the biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the
complete genome sequence.";
"Whole-genome comparison of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical and
laboratory strains.";
-!- FUNCTION: Key enzyme in the regulation of glycerol uptake and
    metabolism.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + glycerol = ADP + sn-glycerol 3-
    phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycerol utilization; rate-limiting step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FGGY kinase family.
