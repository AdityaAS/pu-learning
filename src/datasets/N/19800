Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 1 (EC 4.1.1.31) (PEPCase 1) (PEPC 1)
(AtPPC1).
"Identification and expression analysis of a gene encoding a
bacterial-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from Arabidopsis and
rice.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 1 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Through the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
    it forms oxaloacetate, a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid source for
    the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphate + oxaloacetate = H(2)O +
    phosphoenolpyruvate + CO(2).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: By light-reversible phosphorylation (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate metabolism; tricarboxylic acid cycle.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in all plant organs, with higher
    levels in roots.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PEPCase family.
