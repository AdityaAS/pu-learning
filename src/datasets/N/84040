AC   Q5HJC1;
2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase 2
(EC 2.7.7.60) (4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase 2)
(MEP cytidylyltransferase 2) (MCT 2).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-
    methyl-D-erythritol from CTP and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-
    phosphate (MEP) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CTP + 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate =
    diphosphate + 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol.
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; isopentenyl-PP biosynthesis via
    DXP pathway; isopentenyl-PP from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:
    step 2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ispD family.
 GO:0016114; P:terpenoid biosynthesis; IEA:HAMAP.
