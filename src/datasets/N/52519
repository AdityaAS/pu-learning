-!- FUNCTION: This protein binds free fatty acids and their coenzyme A
    derivatives, bilirubin, and some other small molecules in the
    cytoplasm; it may be involved in intracellular lipid transport.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fatty-acid binding protein (FABP)
    family.
