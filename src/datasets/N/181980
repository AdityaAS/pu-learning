AC   Q87NH5;
Asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.22) (Asparagine--tRNA ligase)
(AsnRS).
"Genome sequence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus: a pathogenic mechanism
distinct from that of V. cholerae.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-asparagine + tRNA(Asn) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-asparaginyl-tRNA(Asn).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
