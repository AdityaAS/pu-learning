AC   Q29476;
Sulfotransferase 1A1 (EC 2.8.2.1) (Aryl sulfotransferase) (Phenol
sulfotransferase) (Phenol-sulfating phenol sulfotransferase) (P-PST).
"Molecular cloning and sequencing of a dog liver cDNA (dPST-1)
encoding a phenol sulfotransferase.";
"Canine sulfotransferase SULT1A1: molecular cloning, expression, and
characterization.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of catecholamines and
    phenolic drugs and neurotransmitters. Acts on p-nitrophenol (PNP),
    alpha-naphthol, dopamine, minoxidil and beta-estradiol but not
    dehydroepiandrosterone.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + a phenol =
    adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + an aryl sulfate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitously expressed in canine tissues with
    highest expression in male and female liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sulfotransferase family.
