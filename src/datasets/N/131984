AC   Q94JN2;
Profilin (Minor food allergen Ana c 1).
"IgE reactivity to profilin in pollen-sensitized subjects with adverse
reactions to banana and pineapple.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to actin and affects the structure of the
    cytoskeleton. At high concentrations, profilin prevents the
    polymerization of actin, whereas it enhances it at low
    concentrations. By binding to PIP2, it inhibits the formation of
    IP3 and DG (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Occurs in many kinds of cells as a complex with monomeric
    actin in a 1:1 ratio.
-!- ALLERGEN: Causes an allergic reaction in human. Binds to IgE. This
    is a food allergen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the profilin family.
Actin-binding; Allergen; Cytoskeleton.
