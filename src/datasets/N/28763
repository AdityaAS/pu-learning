AC   Q9ZBR1;
Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.3) (Pantetheine-
phosphate adenylyltransferase) (PPAT) (Dephospho-CoA
pyrophosphorylase).
"Complete genome sequence of the model actinomycete Streptomyces
coelicolor A3(2).";
-!- FUNCTION: Reversibly transfers an adenylyl group from ATP to 4'-
    phosphopantetheine, yielding dephospho-CoA (dPCoA) and
    pyrophosphate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + pantetheine 4'-phosphate = diphosphate +
    3'-dephospho-CoA.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; coenzyme A biosynthesis; coenzyme
    A from pantothenate: step 4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homohexamer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial coaD family.
