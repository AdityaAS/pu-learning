AC   Q6CEI9;
SVP1-like protein 2.
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in mitochondrial or peroxisomal functions and
    amino acid signaling pathways (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; peripheral
    membrane protein (By similarity). Cytoplasmic vesicle; cytoplasmic
    vesicle membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By similarity).
    Note=Vesicular and vacuolar (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: May contain a beta-propeller domain involved in specific
    binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate (PIP2), leading to
    the association of the protein to the membrane (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the WD repeat SVP1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 WD repeats.
