Bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase 1 (DHFR-TS
1) [Includes: Dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3); Thymidylate
synthase (EC 2.1.1.45)].
"The origin of the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate
synthase isogenes of Arabidopsis thaliana.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 2 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: TS is exclusively involved in de novo dTMP biosynthesis.
    DHFR can have two different roles depending on the source of
    dihydrofolate: de novo synthesis of tetrahydrofolate or recycling
    of the dihydrofolate released as one of the end products of the TS
    catalyzed reaction.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate + NADP(+) = 7,8-
    dihydrofolate + NADPH.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + dUMP =
    dihydrofolate + dTMP.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis;
    tetrahydrofolate from 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-
    dihydropteridine diphosphate and 4-aminobenzoate: step 3 [final
    step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer or homodimer (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The reaction catalyzed by this enzyme represents an
    essential step for de novo glycine and purine synthesis, DNA
    precursor synthesis, and for the conversion of dUMP to dTMP.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the
    dihydrofolate reductase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the thymidylate
    synthase family.
