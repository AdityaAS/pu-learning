-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Salivary gland.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: The sequence shown is that from strain Oregon-R. The
    number of the 7 residues repeat vary between strains: strain
    Oregon-R(2/10) has 11 more copies, strain Karsnas has 8 more
    copies of the repeat, strain Samarkand-pk1 has 1 less copy and
    strain Samarkand-pSW9 and strain Berkeley have 2 less copies.
