AC   P65612; Q8YC62;
Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.2) (Aspartate
transcarbamylase) (ATCase).
"The Brucella suis genome reveals fundamental similarities between
animal and plant pathogens and symbionts.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Carbamoyl phosphate + L-aspartate = phosphate
    + N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; UMP biosynthesis; UMP from
    HCO(3)(-): step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Pyrimidine biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATCase/OTCase family.
 GO:0006221; P:pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis; IEA:HAMAP.
