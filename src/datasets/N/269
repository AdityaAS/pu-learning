HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, B-15 alpha chain precursor

-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the presentation of foreign antigens to the
    immune system.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha chain and a beta chain (beta-2-
    microglobulin). Interacts with human herpesvirus 8 MIR1 protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- PTM: Polyubiquitinated in a post ER compartment by interaction
    with human herpesvirus 8 MIR1 protein. This targets the protein
    for rapid degradation via the ubiquitin system (By similarity).
-!- POLYMORPHISM: The following alleles of B-15 are known: B*1501 (Bw-
    62; B-62), B*1502 (Bw-75, B-75), B*1503 (Bw-72; B-72; B-70)
    B*1504, B*1511, B*1519 and B*1566. Allele B*1502 is associated
    with susceptibility to Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The sequence
    shown is that of B*1501.
-!- DISEASE: Involved in susceptibility to Stevens-Johnson syndrome
    [MIM:608579]. This is a life-threatening reaction of the skin to
    particular types of medication. It is characterized by high fever,
    malaise and blistering exanthema. The more severe form of the
    disease is referred to as toxic epidermal necrolysis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MHC class I family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like C1-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
