AC   Q47ZU7;
FMN-dependent NADH-azoreductase 2 (EC 1.7.-.-) (FMN-dependent NADH-azo
compound oxidoreductase 2) (Azo-dye reductase 2).
"The psychrophilic lifestyle as revealed by the genome sequence of
Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H through genomic and proteomic
analyses.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reductive cleavage of azo bond in aromatic
    azo compounds to the corresponding amines. Requires NADH, but not
    NADPH, as an electron donor for its activity (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the azoreductase type 1 family.
