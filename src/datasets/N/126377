AC   P45609;
Phosphate regulon sensor protein phoR (EC 2.7.13.3).
"Phosphate regulon in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae:
comparison of the phoB-phoR operons of Escherichia coli, Shigella
dysenteriae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Member of the two-component regulatory system phoR/phoB
    involved in the phosphate regulon genes expression. PhoR may
    function as a membrane-associated protein kinase that
    phosphorylates phoB in response to environmental signals.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + protein L-histidine = ADP + protein N-
    phospho-L-histidine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 histidine kinase domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domain.
