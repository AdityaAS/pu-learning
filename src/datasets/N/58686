Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12) (GAPDH)
(Plasminogen-binding protein) (Plasmin receptor).
"Cloning, sequence analysis, and expression in Escherichia coli of a
streptococcal plasmin receptor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Also binds human plasminogen.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + phosphate +
    NAD(+) = 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate + NADH.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; pyruvate from D-
    glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
    dehydrogenase family.
Direct protein sequencing; Glycolysis; NAD; Oxidoreductase.
