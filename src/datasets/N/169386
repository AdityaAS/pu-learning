AC   Q5HD55;
HTH-type transcriptional regulator sarU (Staphylococcal accessory
regulator U).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Positive regulator of RNAII and RNAIII in a cell
    density-dependent manner. It can contribute to the expression of
    virulence genes controlled by agr. May also regulate target genes
    via an agr-independent pathway (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sarA family.
