-!- FUNCTION: When transfected into cell lines in which it is not
    expressed, suppresses cell growth. May play a role in tumor
    development.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=O95990-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O95990-2; Sequence=VSP_009232;
      Note=May be due to an intron retention. No experimental
      confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed in normal tissues. Expression
    is reduced or absent in a number of cancer cell lines.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FAM107 family.
