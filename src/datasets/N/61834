AC   P36267;
Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase precursor (EC 2.3.2.2) [Contains: Gamma-
glutamyltransferase large chain; Gamma-glutamyltransferase small
chain].
"Molecular cloning of the gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase gene from a
Pseudomonas strain.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (5-L-glutamyl)-peptide + an amino acid =
    peptide + 5-L-glutamyl amino acid.
