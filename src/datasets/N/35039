Cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIb isoform 2 (EC 1.9.3.1) (COX VIb-2)
(Cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIb, testis-specific isoform).
"Cytochrome c oxidase of mammals contains a testes-specific isoform of
subunit VIb -- the counterpart to testes-specific cytochrome c?";
-!- FUNCTION: Connects the two COX monomers into the physiological
    dimeric form (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 ferrocytochrome c + O(2) = 4 ferricytochrome
    c + 2 H(2)O.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial intermembrane
    space (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Testis specific.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome c oxidase VIb family.
Mitochondrion; Oxidoreductase.
