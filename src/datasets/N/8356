AC   Q71ZE6;
Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7) (APRT).
"Whole genome comparisons of serotype 4b and 1/2a strains of the food-
borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes reveal new insights into the
core genome components of this species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes a salvage reaction resulting in the formation
    of AMP, that is energically less costly than de novo synthesis.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: AMP + diphosphate = adenine + 5-phospho-alpha-
    D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Purine salvage.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the purine/pyrimidine
    phosphoribosyltransferase family.
