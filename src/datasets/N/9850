AC   Q7SIE0;
Delta-1 crystallin (Delta crystallin I).
"Structural studies of duck delta 1 and delta 2 crystallin suggest
conformational changes occur during catalysis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Delta crystallin, the principal crystallin in embryonic
    lens, is found only in birds and reptiles (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Eye lens.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lyase 1 family. Argininosuccinate lyase
    subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Despite possessing the necessary catalytic residues, this
    protein does not function as an enzymatically active
    argininosuccinate lyase.
 GO:0005212; F:structural constituent of eye lens; TAS:UniProtKB.
