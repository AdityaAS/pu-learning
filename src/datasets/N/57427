"Genomic sequence comparison of two unrelated isolates of the human
gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori.";
-!- FUNCTION: Iron-storage protein (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 Fe(2+) + 4 H(+) + O(2) = 4 Fe(3+) + 2 H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homo-oligomer of 24 subunits that assemble into a
    spherical protein shell (12 +/- 1 nM diameter) that can sequester
    at least 2000 iron atoms (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ferritin family. Prokaryotic subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ferritin-like diiron domain.
