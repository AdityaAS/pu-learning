AC   Q7ZAM3;
Tyrosine recombinase xerD.
"Genome sequence of Oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from the Iheya
Ridge and its unexpected adaptive capabilities to extreme
environments.";
-!- FUNCTION: Site-specific tyrosine recombinase, which acts by
    catalyzing the cutting and rejoining of the recombining DNA
    molecules. The xerC-xerD complex is essential to convert dimers of
    the bacterial chromosome into monomers to permit their segregation
    at cell division. It also contributes to the segregational
    stability of plasmids (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a cyclic heterotetrameric complex composed of two
    molecules of xerC and two molecules of xerD (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the "phage" integrase family. XerD type 1
    subfamily.
