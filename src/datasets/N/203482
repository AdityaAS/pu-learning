AC   O21945;
Single-stranded DNA-binding protein (Helix-destabilizing protein)
(Gp32) (Fragment).
-!- FUNCTION: Binds preferentially to single-stranded DNA and
    therefore, destabilizes double-stranded DNA. It is involved in DNA
    replication, repair and recombination. Binds ss-DNA as the
    replication fork advances and stimulates the replisome
    processivity and accuracy.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer in the absence of DNA, monomer when binding DNA
    (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Interacts with the polymerase and the uvsX and uvsY
    proteins (By similarity).
