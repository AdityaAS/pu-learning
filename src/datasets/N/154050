-!- FUNCTION: This protein binds to the 23S rRNA, and is important in
    its secondary structure. It is located near the subunit interface
    in the base of the L7/L12 stalk, and near the tRNA binding site of
    the peptidyltransferase center (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L6P family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.4) thought to be an outer membrane
    binding protein (chlanectin). The sequence was incorrect due to a
    cloning artifact.
