AC   Q9I7C3;
DNA replication and repair protein recF.
"Complete genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an
opportunistic pathogen.";
-!- FUNCTION: The recF protein is involved in DNA metabolism; it is
    required for DNA replication and normal SOS inducibility. RecF
    binds preferentially to single-stranded, linear DNA. It also seems
    to bind ATP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the recF family.
