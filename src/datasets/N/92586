AC   Q88LE7;
3-isopropylmalate dehydratase small subunit (EC 4.2.1.33)
(Isopropylmalate isomerase) (Alpha-IPM isomerase) (IPMI).
"Complete genome sequence and comparative analysis of the
metabolically versatile Pseudomonas putida KT2440.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the isomerization between 2-isopropylmalate
    and 3-isopropylmalate, via the formation of 2-isopropylmaleate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (2R,3S)-3-isopropylmalate = (2S)-2-
    isopropylmaleate + H(2)O.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (2S)-2-isopropylmaleate + H(2)O = 3-hydroxy-4-
    methyl-3-carboxypentanoate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-leucine biosynthesis; L-
    leucine from 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate: step 2.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of leuC and leuD (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the leuD family. LeuD type 1 subfamily.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis;
Complete proteome; Leucine biosynthesis; Lyase.
