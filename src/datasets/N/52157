AC   P19540;
Coagulation factor IX precursor (EC 3.4.21.22) (Christmas factor)
[Contains: Coagulation factor IXa light chain; Coagulation factor IXa
heavy chain].
"Phenotypic correction of factor IX deficiency in skin fibroblasts of
hemophilic dogs.";
"Molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding canine factor IX.";
"Canine hemophilia B resulting from a point mutation with unusual
consequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: Factor IX is a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein that
    participates in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation by
    converting factor X to its active form in the presence of Ca(2+)
    ions, phospholipids, and factor VIIIa.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Selective cleavage of Arg-|-Ile bond in factor
    X to form factor Xa.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a light chain and a heavy chain;
    disulfide-linked.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Synthesized primarily in the liver and
    secreted in plasma.
-!- DOMAIN: Calcium binds to the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)
    residues and, with stronger affinity, to another site, beyond the
    Gla domain.
-!- PTM: Activated by factor XIa, which excises the activation
    peptide.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in F9 are the cause of hemophilia B (HEMB).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase S1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 EGF-like domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Gla (gamma-carboxy-glutamate) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase S1 domain.
