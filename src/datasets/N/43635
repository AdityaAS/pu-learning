AC   Q9AIU7;
DNA ligase (EC 6.5.1.2) (Polydeoxyribonucleotide synthase [NAD+]).
"Cloning and functional characterization of an NAD(+)-dependent DNA
ligase from Staphylococcus aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester
    linkages between 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl groups in double-
    stranded DNA using NAD as a coenzyme and as the energy source for
    the reaction. It is essential for DNA replication and repair of
    damaged DNA.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NAD(+) + (deoxyribonucleotide)(n) +
    (deoxyribonucleotide)(m) = AMP + nicotinamide nucleotide +
    (deoxyribonucleotide)(n+m).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NAD-dependent DNA ligase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 BRCT domain.
