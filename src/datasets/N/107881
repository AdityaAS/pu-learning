-!- FUNCTION: Probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which mediates
    ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target
    proteins. May function as a facilitator or regulator of
    transcriptional activation by MYC. May have a role during
    synaptogenesis.
-!- PATHWAY: Ubiquitin conjugation; third step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with MYC. Interacts with TSC2 (tuberin) when
    TSC2 is in complex with TSC1 (hamartin).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=O75592-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O75592-2; Sequence=VSP_014183;
      Note=Derived from EST data;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in all tissues examined, expression
    is exceptionally abundant in brain and thymus. Colocalizes with
    TSC1 and TSC2 along the neurites and in the growth cones.
    Colocalized with TSC1 in one of the filopodial extensions at the
    tip of a growth cone.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 B box-type zinc finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 filamin repeat.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 RCC1 repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RING-type zinc finger.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (CAI39758) sequence differs from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
