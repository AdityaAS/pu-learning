AC   Q9FBN6;
Fumarate hydratase class II (EC 4.2.1.2) (Fumarase C).
"Complete genome sequence of the model actinomycete Streptomyces
coelicolor A3(2).";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (S)-malate = fumarate + H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate metabolism; tricarboxylic acid cycle.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: There are 2 substrate binding sites: the catalytic
    A site, and the non-catalytic B site that may play a role in the
    transfer of substrate or product between the active site and the
    solvent. Alternatively, the B site may bind allosteric effectors
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II fumarase/aspartase family.
    Fumarase subfamily.
