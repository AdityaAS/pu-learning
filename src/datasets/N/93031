AC   Q8CX97;
Prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (EC 2.4.99.-).
"Genome sequence of Oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from the Iheya
Ridge and its unexpected adaptive capabilities to extreme
environments.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transfers the N-acyl diglyceride group on what will
    become the N-terminal cysteine of membrane lipoproteins (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Lipoprotein biosynthesis; first step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lgt family.
