Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] 2 (EC 1.15.1.1) (Superoxide dismutase
[Cu-Zn] II) (SOD II) (Fragment).
"Purification of two superoxide dismutase isozymes and their
subcellular localization in needles and roots of Norway spruce (Picea
abies L.) trees.";
-!- FUNCTION: Destroys radicals which are normally produced within the
    cells and which are toxic to biological systems.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 superoxide + 2 H(+) = O(2) + H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 copper ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Dominant isozyme in roots.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase family.
