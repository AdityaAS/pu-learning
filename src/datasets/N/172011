Sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 2 (EC 3.1.3.-) (Sphingosine-1-
phosphatase 2) (SPPase2) (Spp2) (hSPP2).
"Identification and characterization of a novel human sphingosine-1-
phosphate phosphohydrolase, hSPP2.";
"Complete sequencing and characterization of 21,243 full-length human
cDNAs.";
-!- FUNCTION: In vitro, has high phosphohydrolase activity against
    dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed strongly in kidney and heart,
    followed by brain, colon, small intestine and lung.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type 2 lipid phosphate phosphatase
    family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to the
    presence of a sequence of unknown origin.
