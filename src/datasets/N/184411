-!- FUNCTION: Receptor that may play a role in the perception of
    bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the
    chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity
    of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2
    activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells
    of the tongue and palate epithelium and exclusively in gustducin-
    positive cells.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Most taste cells may be activated by a limited
    number of bitter compounds; individual taste cells can
    discriminate among bitter stimuli.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor T2R family.
