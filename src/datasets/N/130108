AC   Q7SF72;
Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-like 1 (EC 5.2.1.8) (PPIase)
(Rotamase).
"What's in the genome of a filamentous fungus? Analysis of the
Neurospora genome sequence.";
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes
    the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in
    oligopeptides (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Peptidylproline (omega=180) = peptidylproline
    (omega=0).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyclophilin-type PPIase family. PPIL1
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PPIase cyclophilin-type domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 and Ref.2 sequences differ from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
Isomerase; Rotamase.
