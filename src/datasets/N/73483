ATP phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.17) (ATP-PRTase) (ATP-PRT).
"The complete genome sequence of the Arabidopsis and tomato pathogen
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the condensation of ATP and PRPP to form N'-
    5'-phosphoribosyl-ATP (PR-ATP). Has a crucial role in the pathway
    because the rate of histidine biosynthesis seems to be controlled
    primarily by regulation of hisG enzymatic activity (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)-ATP + diphosphate =
    ATP + 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-histidine biosynthesis; L-
    histidine from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heteromultimer composed of hisG and hisZ subunits (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Lacks the C-terminal regulatory region which is replaced
    by hisZ.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATP phosphoribosyltransferase family.
    Short subfamily.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Complete proteome; Glycosyltransferase;
