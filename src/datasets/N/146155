AC   Q7V977;
6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase (EC 2.5.1.9) (DMRL synthase)
(Lumazine synthase) (Riboflavin synthase beta chain).
"Genome divergence in two Prochlorococcus ecotypes reflects oceanic
niche differentiation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Riboflavin synthase is a bifunctional enzyme complex
    catalyzing the formation of riboflavin from 5-amino-6-(1'-D)-
    ribityl-amino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione and L-3,4-dihydrohy-2-
    butanone-4-phosphate via 6,7-dimethyl-8-lumazine. The beta subunit
    catalyzes the condensation of 5-amino-6-(1'-D)-ribityl-amino-
    2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione with L-3,4-dihydrohy-2-butanone-4-
    phosphate yielding 6,7-dimethyl-8-lumazine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine =
    riboflavin + 4-(1-D-ribitylamino)-5-amino-2,6-dihydroxypyrimidine.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; riboflavin biosynthesis; 6,7-
    dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine and riboflavin from 4-(1-D-
    ribitylamino)-5-amino-2,6-dihydroxypyrimidine: single step [final
    step].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DMRL synthase family.
