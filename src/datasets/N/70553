AC   O97711;
Hyaluronan synthase 2 (EC 2.4.1.212) (Hyaluronate synthase 2)
(Hyaluronic acid synthase 2) (HA synthase 2).
"Hyaluronan synthase is expressed during cumulus-oocyte complex
maturation in the cow.";
"HAS2.";
"Hyaluronan synthase expression in bovine eyes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in hyaluronan/hyaluronic acid (HA)
    synthesis (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: n UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + n UDP-D-
    glucuronate = (beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl(1->4)-beta-D-
    glucuronosyl(1->3))(n) + 2n UDP.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycan biosynthesis; hyaluronan biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in corneal endothelial cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nodC/HAS family.
