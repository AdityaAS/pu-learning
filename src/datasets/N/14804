ATP synthase C chain (EC 3.6.3.14) (Lipid-binding protein) (ATPase
subunit III).
"The complete sequence of the rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplast genome:
intermolecular recombination between distinct tRNA genes accounts for
a major plastid DNA inversion during the evolution of the cereals.";
"A comparison of rice chloroplast genomes.";
"In-depth view of structure, activity, and evolution of rice
chromosome 10.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has three main subunits: a, b and c.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: A stretch of the chloroplast genome is duplicated
    within chromosome 10 resulting in the duplication of the gene. The
    expression of these duplicated genes (Os10g0355100, Os10g0527100)
    has not been demonstrated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase C chain family.
