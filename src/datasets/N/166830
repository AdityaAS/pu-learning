-!- FUNCTION: Required for assembly of regular nucleosome arrays by
    the RSF chromatin remodelling complex. Facilitates transcription
    of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genes by the pX transcription
    activator. In case of infection by HBV, together with pX, it
    represses TNF-alpha induced NF-kappaB transcription activation.
    Represses transcription when artificially recruited to chromatin
    by fusion to a heterogeneous DNA binding domain.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with SMARCA5/SNF2H to form the RSF complex.
    Also binds the HBV pX/HBx protein, which is required to activate
    transcription of the viral genome.
