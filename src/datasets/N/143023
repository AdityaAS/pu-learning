exonuclease encoded by the recJ gene of Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Single-stranded-DNA-specific exonuclease. Required for
    many types of recombinational events, although the stringency of
    the requirement for recJ appears to vary with the type of
    recombinational event monitored and the other recombination gene
    products which are available.
