NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (I-kappa-B-alpha) (IkappaBalpha) (IKB-
alpha).
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Structural analysis, expression, and chromosomal localization of the
mouse ikba gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits NF-kappa-B by complexing with and trapping it
    in the cytoplasm. May be involved in regulation of transcriptional
    responses to NF-kappa-B, including cell adhesion, immune and
    proinflammatory responses, apoptosis, differentiation and growth.
    Controlled by sequential serine-phosphorylation, ubiquitination
    and degradation. Tyrosine-phosphorylation could only lead to
    dissociation from NF-kappa-B (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with p65 (RELA). Interacts with NKIRAS1 and
    NKIRAS2 (By similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    O88895:Hdac3; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-644427, EBI-302263;
    Q04207:Rela; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-644427, EBI-644400;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in lymph node, thymus
    followed by liver, brain, muscle, kidney, gastrointestinal and
    reproductive tract.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated; disables inhibition of NF-kappa-B DNA-binding
    activity (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Ubiquitinated; subsequent to stimulus-dependent
    phosphorylation on serines, polyubiquitination targets the protein
    for rapid degradation via the ubiquitin system (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NF-kappa-B inhibitor family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 ANK repeats.
