AC   Q9Z224; Q9D6Q0;
Molybdenum cofactor synthesis protein 2 small subunit (Molybdopterin
synthase small subunit) (MOCS2A).
"Human molybdopterin synthase gene: identification of a bicistronic
transcript with overlapping reading frames.";
-!- FUNCTION: Converts molybdopterin precursor Z into molybdopterin.
    This requires the incorporation of two sulfur atoms into precursor
    Z to generate a dithiolene group.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; molybdopterin biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a large and a small subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein is produced by a bicistronic gene
    which also produces the large subunit from an overlapping reading
    frame.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the moaD family.
