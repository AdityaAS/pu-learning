NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase subunit 1, chloroplast (EC 1.6.5.-)
(NAD(P)H dehydrogenase subunit 1) (NDH subunit 1) (NADH-plastoquinone
oxidoreductase subunit 1).
"Analysis of Acorus calamus chloroplast genome and its phylogenetic
implications.";
-!- FUNCTION: NDH shuttles electrons from NAD(P)H:plastoquinone, via
    FMN and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) centers, to quinones in the
    photosynthetic chain and possibly in a chloroplast respiratory
    chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme in this
    species is believed to be plastoquinone. Couples the redox
    reaction to proton translocation, and thus conserves the redox
    energy in a proton gradient (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NAD(P)H + plastoquinone = NAD(P)(+) +
    plastoquinol.
-!- SUBUNIT: NDH is composed of at least 16 different subunits, 5 of
    which are encoded in the nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I subunit 1 family.
