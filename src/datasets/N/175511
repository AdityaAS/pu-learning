AC   P35326;
Small proline-rich protein 2A (SPR-2A) (2-1).
"Characterization of the human spr2 promoter: induction after UV
irradiation or TPA treatment and regulation during differentiation of
cultured primary keratinocytes.";
"Molecular characterization and evolution of the SPRR family of
keratinocyte differentiation markers encoding small proline-rich
proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cross-linked envelope protein of keratinocytes. It is a
    keratinocyte protein that first appears in the cell cytosol, but
    ultimately becomes cross-linked to membrane proteins by
    transglutaminase. All that results in the formation of an
    insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- INDUCTION: During squamous differentiation of epidermal
    keratinocytes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cornifin (SPRR) family.
