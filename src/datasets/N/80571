AC   Q5HPS2;
Translation initiation factor IF-2.
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the essential components for the initiation of
    protein synthesis. Protects formylmethionyl-tRNA from spontaneous
    hydrolysis and promotes its binding to the 30S ribosomal subunits.
    Also involved in the hydrolysis of GTP during the formation of the
    70S ribosomal complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IF-2 family.
 GO:0003924; F:GTPase activity; IEA:HAMAP.
