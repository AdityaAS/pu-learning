AC   P17495;
Disintegrin trigramin-beta-2 (Platelet aggregation activation
inhibitor) [Contains: Disintegrin trigramin-beta-1].
"Platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa protein antagonists from snake venoms:
evidence for a family of platelet-aggregation inhibitors.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits fibrinogen interaction with platelet receptors
    expressed on glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Acts by binding to the
    glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor on the platelet surface and
    inhibits aggregation induced by ADP, thrombin, platelet-activating
    factor and collagen.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the disintegrin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 disintegrin domain.
Blood coagulation; Cell adhesion; Direct protein sequencing.
