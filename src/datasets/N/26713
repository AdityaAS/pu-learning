AC   Q67EQ0;
C-type lectin domain family 4 member A (C-type lectin superfamily
member 6) (Dendritic cell inhibitory receptor).
"Identification of lectin-like receptors expressed by antigen
presenting cells and neutrophils and their mapping to a novel gene
complex.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in regulating immune reactivity. May
    play a role in modulating dendritic cells (DC) differentiation
    and/or maturation. May be involved in the inhibition of B-cell-
    receptor-mediated calcium mobilization and protein tyrosine
    phosphorylation (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: May interact with PTPN6 via its ITIM site (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by myeloid cells (dendritic cells,
    macrophages, and neutrophils) and B-cells.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains 1 copy of a cytoplasmic motif that is referred to
    as the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitor motif (ITIM). This
    motif is involved in modulation of cellular responses. The
    phosphorylated ITIM motif can bind the SH2 domain of several SH2-
    containing phosphatases.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 C-type lectin domain.
