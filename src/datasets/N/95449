AC   P04651;
Lutropin subunit beta precursor (Luteinizing hormone subunit beta)
(LSH-beta) (LSH-B) (LH-B) (Lutropin beta chain).
"The gene for the beta subunit of bovine luteinizing hormone encodes a
gonadotropin mRNA with an unusually short 5'-untranslated region.";
"Analysis of several bovine lutropin beta subunit cDNAs reveals
heterogeneity in nucleotide sequence.";
"Luteinizing hormone. The primary structures of the beta-subunit from
bovine and porcine species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Promotes spermatogenesis and ovulation by stimulating
    the testes and ovaries to synthesize steroids.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a common alpha chain and a unique beta
    chain which confers biological specificity to thyrotropin,
    lutropin, follitropin and gonadotropin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycoprotein hormones subunit beta
    family.
