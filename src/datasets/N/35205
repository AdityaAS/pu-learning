Gap junction beta-6 protein.
"Characterization of 954 bovine full-CDS cDNA sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: One gap junction consists of a cluster of closely packed
    pairs of transmembrane channels, the connexons, through which
    materials of low MW diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: A connexon is composed of a hexamer of connexins (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the connexin family. Beta-type (group I)
    subfamily.
