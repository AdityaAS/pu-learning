AC   Q9NJ15; Q9NJ14; Q9NJ16;
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 precursor (EC 3.4.21.-)
(Proprotein convertase PC6-like) (aPC6).
"Evolution of the prohormone convertases: identification of a
homologue of PC6 in the protochordate amphioxus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Likely to represent a widespread endoprotease activity
    within the constitutive and regulated secretory pathway. Capable
    of cleavage at the RX(K/R)R consensus motif (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Release of mature proteins from their
    proproteins by cleavage of Arg-Xaa-Yaa-Arg-|-Zaa bonds, where Xaa
    can be any amino acid and Yaa is Arg or Lys.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Isoform A: Secreted protein. Isoform C:
    Secreted protein. Isoform B: Cell membrane; single-pass type I
    membrane protein.

-!- DOMAIN: The propeptide domain acts as an intramolecular chaperone
    assisting the folding of the zymogen within the endoplasmic
    reticulum.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase S8 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 homo B/P domain.
