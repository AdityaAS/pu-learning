AC   O76808;
Suppressor of hairless homolog (Su(H)).
"Suppressor of hairless activates brachyury expression in the Ciona
embryo.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional regulator wich plays a central role in
    Notch signaling, a signaling pathway involved in cell-cell
    communications that regulates a broad spectrum of cell-fate
    determinations. Acts as a transcriptional repressor when it is not
    associated with Notch proteins. When associated with some Notch
    protein, it acts as a transcriptional activator that activates
    transcription of Notch target genes (By similarity). Required for
    the transcriptional expression of Brachyury, suggesting that it
    participates in notochord differentiation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with activated Notch proteins (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Su(H) family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 IPT/TIG domain.
