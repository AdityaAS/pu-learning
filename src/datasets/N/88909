AC   Q59988; Q31LC6;
Ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase (EC 2.7.6.1) (RPPK) (Phosphoribosyl
pyrophosphate synthetase) (P-Rib-PP synthetase) (PRPP synthetase).
"A cyanobacterial gene encoding a protein with extensive homology to
mammalian phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase.";
"Complete sequence of chromosome 1 of Synechococcus elongatus PCC
7942.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + D-ribose 5-phosphate = AMP + 5-phospho-
    alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; 5-phospho-alpha-D-
    ribose 1-diphosphate biosynthesis; 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-
    diphosphate from D-ribose 5-phosphate (route I): single step
    [final step].
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase
    family.
