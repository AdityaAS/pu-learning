AC   Q9JHC6;
WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 2 precursor (WISP-2)
(Connective tissue growth factor-like protein) (CTGF-L) (CCN family
protein COP-1).
"Identification of rCop-1, a new member of the CCN protein family, as
a negative regulator for cell transformation.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play an important role in modulating bone turnover.
    Promotes the adhesion of osteoblast cells and inhibits the binding
    of fibrinogen to integrin receptors. In addition, inhibits
    osteocalcin production (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CCN family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 IGFBP domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 TSP type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 VWFC domain.
