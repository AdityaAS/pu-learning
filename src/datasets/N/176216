Signal recognition particle receptor subunit alpha (SR-alpha) (Docking
protein alpha) (DP-alpha).
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Ensures, in conjunction with SRP, the correct targeting
    of the nascent secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane system (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta chain (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By similarity).
    Note=Thought to be anchored in the membrane through an interaction
    with SR-beta, which contains a bona fide transmembrane domain (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GTP-binding SRP family.
