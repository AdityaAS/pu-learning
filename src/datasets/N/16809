-!- FUNCTION: This protein is the basis of the ABO blood group system.
    The histo-blood group ABO involves three carbohydrate antigens: A,
    B, and H. A, B, and AB individuals express a glycosyltransferase
    activity that converts the H antigen to the A antigen (by addition
    of UDP-GalNAc) or to the B antigen (by addition of UDP-Gal),
    whereas O individuals lack such activity.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine + glycoprotein-
    alpha-L-fucosyl-(1,2)-D-galactose = UDP + glycoprotein-N-acetyl-
    alpha-D-galactosaminyl-(1,3)-(alpha-L-fucosyl-(1,2))-D-galactose.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-galactose + alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->2)-D-
    galactosyl-R = UDP + alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-(alpha-L-fucosyl-
    (1->2))-D-galactosyl-R.
-!- COFACTOR: Manganese.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycosylation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack; Golgi stack
    membrane; single-pass type II membrane protein. Secreted protein.
    Note=Membrane-bound form in trans cisternae of Golgi. Secreted
    into the body fluid.
-!- DOMAIN: The conserved DXD motif is involved in cofactor binding.
    The manganese ion interacts with the beta-phosphate group of UDP
    and may also have a role in catalysis.
-!- PTM: The soluble form derives from the membrane form by
    proteolytic processing.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: The sequence shown is that of the A transferase. The
    B form differs by a few residues substitutions. The O phenotype is
    result of a single base frameshift deletion in the N-terminal
    extremity of the gene.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 6 family.
