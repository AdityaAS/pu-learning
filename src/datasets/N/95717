AC   P09141;
Alkanal monooxygenase beta chain (EC 1.14.14.3) (Bacterial luciferase
beta chain).
"Nucleotide sequence of part of Photobacterium leiognathi lux
region.";
"Nucleotide sequence of genes for alpha- and beta-subunits of
luciferase from Photobacterium leiognathi.";
"Isolation of bioluminescent functions from Photobacterium leiognathi:
analysis of luxA, luxB, luxG and neighboring genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Light-emitting reaction in luminous bacteria. The
    specific role of the beta subunit is unknown, but it is absolutely
    required for bioluminescence activity.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: RCHO + reduced FMN + O(2) = RCOOH + FMN +
    H(2)O + light.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta chain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial luciferase oxidoreductase
    family.
