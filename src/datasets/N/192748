AC   O13947;
Probable tRNA (5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridylate)-methyltransferase
(EC 2.1.1.61).
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the biosynthesis of 5-taurinomethyl-2-
    thiouridine (tm5s2U) of mitochondrial tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu), and
    tRNA(Gln) in the wobble position (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA = S-adenosyl-L-
    homocysteine + tRNA containing 5-methylaminomethyl-2-
    thiouridylate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the trmU family.
