AC   Q6GI01;
Phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.3.9)
(Phosphotransferase system, enzyme I).
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is a component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent
    sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), a major carbohydrate active
    -transport system. Enzyme I transfers the phosphoryl group from
    phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the phosphoryl carrier protein (HPr).
    Enzyme I is common to all PTS.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphoenolpyruvate + protein L-histidine =
    pyruvate + protein N(pi)-phospho-L-histidine.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PEP-utilizing enzyme family.
