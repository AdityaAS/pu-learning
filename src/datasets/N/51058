Enterotoxin type H precursor (SEH).
"Genome and virulence determinants of high virulence community-
acquired MRSA.";
-!- FUNCTION: Staphylococcal enterotoxins cause the intoxication
    staphylococcal food poisoning syndrome. The illness characterized
    by high fever, hypotension, diarrhea, shock, and in some cases
    death (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit. The zinc ion is necessary
    for the toxin interaction with MHC class II (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the staphylococcal/streptococcal toxin
    family.
