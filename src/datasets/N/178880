AC   Q8EBS1;
Alanyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.7) (Alanine--tRNA ligase) (AlaRS).
"Genome sequence of the dissimilatory metal ion-reducing bacterium
Shewanella oneidensis.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-alanine + tRNA(Ala) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-alanyl-tRNA(Ala).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
