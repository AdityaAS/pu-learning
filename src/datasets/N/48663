AC   O35949;
Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 3 (Cold-inducible
glycoprotein of 30 kDa) (CIN-2).
"Cig30, a mouse member of a novel membrane protein gene family, is
involved in the recruitment of brown adipose tissue.";
"Cig30 and Pitx3 genes are arranged in a partially overlapping tail-
to-tail array resulting in complementary transcripts.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in a membrane event related to cellular
    proliferation in brown adipose tissue. Could be implicated in
    synthesis of very long chain fatty acids and sphingolipids. May
    catalyze one or both of the reduction reaction in fatty acid
    elongation, i.e., conversion of beta-ketoacyl CoA to beta-
    hydroxyacyl CoA or reduction of trans-2-enoyl CoA to the saturated
    acyl CoA derivative.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Readily detected in brown adipose tissue and
    liver. Weak expression in kidney, white adipose tissue, heart and
    skin. Not detected in lung, testis, muscle, spleen, brain, thymus
    and intestine.
-!- INDUCTION: Elevated in brown adipose tissue in conditions of brown
    fat recruitment, namely cold stress, perinatal development and
    after diet-induced thermogenesis. A synergistic action of both
    catecholamines and glucocorticoids is required for the induction.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ELO family.
