AC   P32456; Q86TB0;
Interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein 2 (GTP-binding protein 2)
(Guanine nucleotide-binding protein 2) (GBP-2) (HuGBP-2).
"Interferon-induced guanylate-binding proteins lack an N(T)KXD
consensus motif and bind GMP in addition to GDP and GTP.";
"GTPase properties of the interferon-induced human guanylate-binding
protein 2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds GTP, GDP and GMP. Hydrolyzes GTP very efficiently;
    GDP rather than GMP is the major reaction product.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; cytoplasmic
    side (Potential).
-!- INDUCTION: By interferon gamma during macrophage activation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GBP family.
