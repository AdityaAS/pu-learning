AC   Q9VAL0;
Probable signal peptidase complex subunit 1 (EC 3.4.-.-) (Microsomal
signal peptidase 12 kDa subunit) (SPase 12 kDa subunit).

systematic review.";
-!- FUNCTION: Microsomal signal peptidase is a membrane-bound
    endoproteinase that removes signal peptides from nascent proteins
    as they are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic
    reticulum (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex of five different proteins: SEC11L1, SEC11L3,
    SPCS1, SPCS2 and SPCS3 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SPCS1 family.
