-!- FUNCTION: E3 ubiquitin ligase protein that mediates
    monoubiquitination of 'Lys-120' of histone H2B. H2B 'Lys-120'
    ubiquitination gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional
    activation and is also prerequisite for histone H3 'Lys-4' and
    'Lys-79' methylation. Forms a ubiquitin ligase complex in
    cooperation with the E2 enzyme UBE2E1/UBCH6. It thereby plays a
    central role in histone code and gene regulation. Required for
    transcriptional activation of Hox genes (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Ubiquitin conjugation; third step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Component of the RNF20/40 complex at least
    composed of 2 copies of RNF20/BRE1A, 2 copies of RNF40/BRE1B and
    UBE2E1/UBCH6. Interacts with RB1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the BRE1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RING-type zinc finger.
