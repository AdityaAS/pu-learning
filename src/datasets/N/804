"Genome sequences of Chlamydia trachomatis MoPn and Chlamydia
pneumoniae AR39.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 6-phospho-D-gluconate + NADP(+) = D-ribulose
    5-phosphate + CO(2) + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; pentose phosphate pathway; D-
    ribulose 5-phosphate from D-glucose 6-phosphate (oxidative stage):
    step 3.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase
    family.
Complete proteome; Gluconate utilization; NADP; Oxidoreductase;
Pentose shunt.
