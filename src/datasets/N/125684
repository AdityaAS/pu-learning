AC   P45419;
CDP-diacylglycerol--glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase
(EC 2.7.8.5) (Phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase) (PGP synthase).
"Global regulation of expression of antifungal factors by a
Pseudomonas fluorescens biological control strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein catalyzes the committed step to the
    synthesis of the acidic phospholipids (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CDP-diacylglycerol + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate =
    CMP + 3(3-sn-phosphatidyl)-sn-glycerol 1-phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Acidic phospholipids biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase
    class-I family.
