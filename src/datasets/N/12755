AC   Q51MW4;
Autophagy-related protein 8 precursor (Autophagy-related ubiquitin-
like modifier ATG8).
"The genome sequence of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in cytoplasm to vacuole transport (Cvt)
    vesicles and autophagosomes formation. May mediate the delivery of
    the vesicles and autophagosomes to the vacuole via the microtubule
    cytoskeleton (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic vesicle; cvt vesicle; cvt
    vesicle membrane; lipid-anchor (By similarity). Cytoplasmic
    vesicle; autophagosome; autophagosomal membrane; lipid-anchor (By
    similarity). Vacuole; vacuolar membrane; lipid-anchor (By
    similarity). Note=Membrane-associated through a lipid anchor (By
    similarity). Cvt vesicles, autophagosomes and vacuolar (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: The C-terminal 7 residues are removed to expose Gly-116 at
    the C-terminus. The carboxyl-terminal Gly is then amidated with
    phosphatidylethanolamine by an activating system similar to that
    for ubiquitin (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MAP1 LC3 family.
