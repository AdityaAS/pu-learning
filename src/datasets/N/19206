-!- FUNCTION: Reversible hydration of carbon dioxide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: H(2)CO(3) = CO(2) + H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Zinc (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by acetazolamide.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=O43570-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O43570-2; Sequence=VSP_000772;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in colon, kidney, prostate,
    intestine and activated lymphocytes. Expressed at much higher
    levels in the renal cell cancers than in surrounding normal kidney
    tissue. Moderately expressed in pancreas, ovary and testis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the alpha-carbonic anhydrase family.
