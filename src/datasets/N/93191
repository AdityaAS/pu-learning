Light-harvesting polypeptide B-885 beta-2 chain (LH-1) (Antenna
pigment polypeptide beta-2 chain).
"The antenna complexes of the purple non-sulfur photosynthetic
bacterium Rhodocyclus tenuis. Structural and spectral
characterization.";
-!- FUNCTION: Antenna complexes are light-harvesting systems, which
    transfer the excitation energy to the reaction centers.
-!- SUBUNIT: The core complex is formed by different alpha and beta
    chains, binding bacteriochlorophyll molecules, and arranged most
    probably in tetrameric structures disposed around the reaction
    center. The non-pigmented gamma chains may constitute additional
    components.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass type II
    membrane protein.
