-!- FUNCTION: The AROM polypeptide catalyzes 5 consecutive enzymatic
    reactions in prechorismate polyaromatic amino acid biosynthesis.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3-deoxy-arabino-heptulonate 7-phosphate = 3-
    dehydroquinate + phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3-dehydroquinate = 3-dehydroshikimate + H(2)O.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Shikimate + NADP(+) = 3-dehydroshikimate +
    NADPH.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + shikimate = ADP + shikimate 3-phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphoenolpyruvate + 3-phosphoshikimate =
    phosphate + 5-O-(1-carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshikimate.
