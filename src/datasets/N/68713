AC   Q3B1J3;
GMP synthase [glutamine-hydrolyzing] (EC 6.3.5.2) (Glutamine
amidotransferase) (GMP synthetase).
"Complete sequence of Pelodictyon luteolum DSM 273.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the synthesis of GMP from XMP (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + xanthosine 5'-phosphate + L-glutamine +
    H(2)O = AMP + diphosphate + GMP + L-glutamate.
