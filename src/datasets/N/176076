"Isolation of an extragenic suppressor of the rna1-1 mutation in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"Sequence analysis of a 37.6 kbp cosmid clone from the right arm of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XII, carrying YAP3, HOG1, SNR6,
tRNA-Arg3 and 23 new open reading frames, among which several
homologies to proteins involved in cell division control and to
mammalian growth factors and other animal proteins are found.";
