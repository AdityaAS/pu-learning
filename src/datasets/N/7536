AC   Q29437;
Copper amine oxidase, liver isozyme precursor (EC 1.4.3.6) (Amine
oxidase [copper-containing]) (Serum amine oxidase) (SAO).
"Primary structures for a mammalian cellular and serum copper amine
oxidase.";
"Identification of topaquinone and its consensus sequence in copper
amine oxidases.";
"Crystal structure of amine oxidase from bovine serum.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: RCH(2)NH(2) + H(2)O + O(2) = RCHO + NH(3) +
    H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 copper ion per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 calcium ions per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Contains 1 topaquinone per subunit.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein; extracellular space.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Liver.
-!- PTM: Topaquinone (TPQ) is generated by copper-dependent
    autoxidation of a specific tyrosyl residue.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibited by amiloride in a competitive manner.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the copper/topaquinone oxidase family.
