AC   Q3T022;
Histone deacetylase complex subunit SAP18 (Sin3-associated
polypeptide, 18 kDa) (Sin3-associated polypeptide p18).
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the SIN3-repressing complex. Enhances the
    ability of SIN3-HDAC1-mediated transcriptional repression. When
    tethered to the promoter, it can direct the formation of a
    repressive complex to core histone proteins (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a complex with SIN3A and HDAC1 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SAP18 family.
Repressor; Transcription; Transcription regulation.
