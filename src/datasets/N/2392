AC   Q5HF63;
Acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1) (Acetokinase).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + acetate = ADP + acetyl phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + propanoate = ADP + propanoyl phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; acetyl-CoA
    biosynthesis; acetyl-CoA from acetate: step 1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acetokinase family.
