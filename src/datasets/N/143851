AC   Q80TZ9;
Arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide repeats protein (Atrophin-2).
"Prediction of the coding sequences of mouse homologues of KIAA gene:
II. The complete nucleotide sequences of 400 mouse KIAA-homologous
cDNAs identified by screening of terminal sequences of cDNA clones
randomly sampled from size-fractionated libraries.";
"Atrophin 2 recruits histone deacetylase and is required for the
function of multiple signaling centers during mouse embryogenesis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role as a transcriptional repressor during
    development. May play a role in the control of cell survival.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with HDAC1 and ATN1. Interaction with ATN1 is
    improved when the poly-Gln region of ATN1 is extended.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q13547:HDAC1 (xeno); NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-904076, EBI-301834;
    O09106:Hdac1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-904076, EBI-301912;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity). Note=Localized in
    nuclear bodies of variables size. Colocalized with PML and BAX in
    nuclear PODs (By similarity).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: At E8.25 expression is strongly elevated in
    the anterior midline. At E8.5 expression is elevated throughout
    the anteroposterior extent of the notochord and is down-regulated
    in the heart. At E8.75 expression is increased in the ventral
    brain. At E9.5 strong expression appears besides the notochord
    including the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), the isthmus and the
    ventral diencephalon. At E10.5 expression increases in the
    notochord, the AER and spinal and brain neurons.
-!- DOMAIN: The interaction with ATN1 is mediated by the coiled domain
    (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Mutant mice embryos exhibit a variety of patterning
    defects that first appear at E8.0. Defects include a specific
    failure in ventralization of the anterior neural plate, loss of
    heart looping and irregular partitioning of somites. In mutant
    embryos, Shh expression fails to initiate along the anterior
    midline at E8.0, and Fgf8 is delocalized from the anterior neural
    ridge at E8.5.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 BAH domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ELM2 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 GATA-type zinc finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Myb DNA-binding domain.
