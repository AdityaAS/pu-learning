AC   P82466;
Disintegrin EC6B.
"Inhibitory effects of MLDG-containing heterodimeric disintegrins
reveal distinct structural requirements for interaction of the
integrin alpha 9beta 1 with VCAM-1, tenascin-C, and osteopontin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits blood coagulation by binding to integrin a5b1
    receptor and inhibiting the fibrinogen binding to a5b1 receptor.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of EC6A and EC6B linked by two interchain
    disulfide bonds.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the disintegrin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 disintegrin domain.
Cell adhesion; Direct protein sequencing.
