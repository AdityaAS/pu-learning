Matrix metalloproteinase-16 precursor (EC 3.4.24.-) (MMP-16)
(Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase 3) (MT-MMP 3) (MTMMP3)
(Membrane-type-3 matrix metalloproteinase) (MT3-MMP) (MT3MMP).
"Expression of three membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs)
in rat vascular smooth muscle cells and characterization of MT3-MMPs
with and without transmembrane domain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Endopeptidase that degrades various components of the
    extracellular matrix, such as collagen type III and fibronectin.
    Activates progelatinase A. Involved in the matrix remodeling of
    blood vessels. The short isoform efficiently converts
    progelatinase A to the intermediate form but not to the mature
    one. It has no effect on type I, II, IV and V collagen. However,
    upon interaction with CSPG4, it may be involved in degradation and
    invasion of type I collagen by melanoma cells.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Calcium (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with CSPG4 through CSPG4 chondroitin sulfate
    glycosaminoglycan (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Potential). Isoform Short: Secreted protein.
    Note=Localized at the cell surface of melanoma cells (By
    similarity). A secreted form (Short isoform) is produced by
    alternative splicing.

      IsoId=O35548-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Short; Synonyms=MT3-MMP-del;
      IsoId=O35548-2; Sequence=VSP_005455;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Strongly expressed in the lung, brain and
    smooth muscle cells. Weakly detectable in the spleen and liver and
    indetectable in the heart, skeletal muscle and kidney.
-!- PTM: The precursor is cleaved by a furin endopeptidase (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M10A family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 hemopexin-like domain.
