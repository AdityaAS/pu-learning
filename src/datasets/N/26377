AC   Q59768;
Citrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.1) (Fragment).
"Citrate synthase gene comparison, a new tool for phylogenetic
analysis, and its application for the rickettsiae.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + H(2)O + oxaloacetate = citrate +
    CoA.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate metabolism; tricarboxylic acid cycle.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Citrate synthase is found in nearly all cells
    capable of oxidative metabolism.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the citrate synthase family.
Transferase; Tricarboxylic acid cycle.
