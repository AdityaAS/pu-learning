AC   Q72HA0;
Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase beta chain (EC 6.1.1.20) (Phenylalanine--
tRNA ligase beta chain) (PheRS).
"The genome sequence of the extreme thermophile Thermus
thermophilus.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-phenylalanine + tRNA(Phe) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-phenylalanyl-tRNA(Phe).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per tetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta chains (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase beta chain
    family. Type 1 subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 tRNA-binding domain.
