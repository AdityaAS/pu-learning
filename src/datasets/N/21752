AC   P36180;
Probable cytochrome c biosynthesis protein.
"Gene organization deduced from the complete sequence of liverwort
Marchantia polymorpha mitochondrial DNA. A primitive form of plant
mitochondrial genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Could be involved in assembly and maturation of
    cytochromes c. May play a role in guidance of apocytochromes and
    heme groups for the covalent linkage introduced by the cytochrome-
    c-heme lyase.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ccmF/cycK/ccl1/nrfE/ccsA family.
Cytochrome c-type biogenesis; Mitochondrion.
