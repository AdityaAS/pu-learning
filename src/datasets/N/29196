Coat protein (Capsid protein) (CP).
"Cucumber mosaic virus RNA 3. Determination of the nucleotide sequence
provides the amino acid sequences of protein 3A and viral coat
protein.";
"Further implications for the evolutionary relationships between
tripartite plant viruses based on cucumber mosaic virus RNA 3.";
"Micro-identification of amino-terminal acetylamino acids in
proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Coat protein. Probably binds RNA and play a role in
    packaging (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal arginine-rich stretch does not seem to be
    the major RNA-binding region that allows formation of an
    infectious ribonucleoprotein complex (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The virus has a tripartite genome (RNA1, RNA2 and
    RNA3) and an encapsidated subgenomic RNA (RNA4) from which the
    coat protein is expressed. Virions are icosahedral, not enveloped,
    with 32 capsomers per nucleocapsid.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cucumoviruses/bromoviruses coat protein
    family.
