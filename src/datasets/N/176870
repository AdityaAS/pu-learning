AC   Q5RCD7;
Translocon-associated protein subunit gamma (TRAP-gamma) (Signal
sequence receptor subunit gamma) (SSR-gamma).
-!- FUNCTION: TRAP proteins are part of a complex whose function is to
    bind calcium to the ER membrane and thereby regulate the retention
    of ER resident proteins (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer of TRAP-alpha, TRAP-beta, TRAP-delta and
    TRAP-gamma (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TRAP-gamma family.
