AC   O76192;
Seroin precursor (Silk 23 kDa glycoprotein).
"Identification of a novel type of silk protein and regulation of its
expression.";
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Produced by both the posterior (PSG) and
    middle (MSG) sections of silk glands.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Seroin mRNA is high in the silk glands of
    feeding larvae, declines at ecdysis, reaches a maximum during
    cocoon spinning, and thereafter rapidly drops to an undetectable
    level.
