"Isolation and characterization of cDNA for macaque neurological
disease genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Desaturation and elongation of fatty acids, cholesterol
    biosynthesis, drug metabolism, and, in erythrocyte, methemoglobin
    reduction (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + 2 ferricytochrome b5 = NAD(+) + 2
    ferrocytochrome b5.
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Microsomal electron transport system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Isoform 1: Endoplasmic reticulum;
    endoplasmic reticulum membrane; lipid-anchor; cytoplasmic side (By
    similarity). Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane; lipid-
    anchor; cytoplasmic side (By similarity). Isoform 2: Cytoplasm.
    Note=Isoform 2 produces the soluble form found in erythrocytes (By
    similarity).
