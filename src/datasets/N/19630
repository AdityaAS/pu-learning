Caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.104) (Trans-caffeoyl-CoA 3-
O-methyltransferase) (CCoAMT) (CCoAOMT).
"Nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone encoding caffeoyl-coenzyme A 3-O-
methyltransferase of Stellaria longipes (Caryophyllaceae).";
"Molecular characterization of a cDNA encoding caffeoyl-coenzyme A 3-
O-methyltransferase of Stellaria longipes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Methylates caffeoyl-CoA to feruloyl-CoA and 5-
    hydroxyferuloyl-CoA to sinapoyl-CoA. Plays a role in the synthesis
    of feruloylated polysaccharides. Involved in the reinforcement of
    the plant cell wall. Also involved in the responding to wounding
    or pathogen challenge by the increased formation of cell wall-
    bound ferulic acid polymers.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + caffeoyl-CoA = S-
    adenosyl-L-homocysteine + feruloyl-CoA.
-!- PATHWAY: Lignin biosynthesis.
-!- PATHWAY: Phenylpropanoid pathway.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily. Type 3
    family. CCoAMT subfamily.
