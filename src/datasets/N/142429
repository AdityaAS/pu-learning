(Protein A).
"Characterization and construction of functional cDNA clones of
Pariacoto virus, the first Alphanodavirus isolated outside
Australasia.";
-!- FUNCTION: Replicates the viral genome which is composed of two RNA
    segments, RNA1 and RNA2.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nodaviruses RNA polymerase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RdRp catalytic domain.
