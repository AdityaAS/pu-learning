Homeobox protein cut-like 1 (CCAAT displacement protein) (CDP).
"Human CCAAT displacement protein is homologous to the Drosophila
homeoprotein, cut.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Large-scale sequencing of two regions in human chromosome 7q22:
analysis of 650 kb of genomic sequence around the EPO and CUTL1 loci
reveals 17 genes.";
"Exon/intron structure and alternative transcripts of the CUTL1
gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably has a broad role in mammalian development as a
    repressor of developmentally regulated gene expression. May act by
    preventing binding of positively-activing CCAAT factors to
    promoters. Plays an essential role in lung maturation (By
    similarity).
