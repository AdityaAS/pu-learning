-!- FUNCTION: The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mediates various
    cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase,
    breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium
    channels through the action of G proteins. Primary transducing
    effect is Pi turnover.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with GPRASP2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
