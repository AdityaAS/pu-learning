AC   P06589;
Chloroplast 50S ribosomal protein L22.
"The sequence of the maize plastid encoded rpl 22 locus.";
"Transfer of rpl22 to the nucleus greatly preceded its loss from the
chloroplast and involved the gain of an intron.";
"Complete sequence of the maize chloroplast genome: gene content,
hotspots of divergence and fine tuning of genetic information by
transcript editing.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein binds specifically to 23S rRNA (By
    similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: The globular domain of the protein is located near the
    polypeptide exit tunnel on the outside of the subunit, while an
    extended beta-hairpin is found that lines the wall of the exit
    tunnel in the center of the 70S ribosome (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L22P family.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
