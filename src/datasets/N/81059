(IF-A1) (Cel IF A1).
"Eight genes and alternative RNA processing pathways generate an
unexpectedly large diversity of cytoplasmic intermediate filament
proteins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.";

"In vivo and in vitro evidence that the four essential intermediate
filament (IF) proteins A1, A2, A3 and B1 of the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans form an obligate heteropolymeric IF system.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytoplasmic intermediate filaments provide mechanical
    strength to cells. Essential protein probably involved in
    intestine morphogenesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms some heteropolymeric filaments with ifb-1.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in amphid sensory neurins, the
    pharyngeal-intestinal valve, the rectum and some neurons of the
    tail. Expressed in some unidentified muscle cells of the pharynx.
    Also expressed in the adult uterus. In larvae, it is expressed in
    the excretory cell, the vulva, the rectum and into thick filament
    bundles of the pharynx. Expression in pharynx begins in late
    embryos.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the intermediate filament family.
