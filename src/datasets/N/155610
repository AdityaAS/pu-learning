AC   Q8K9Q5;
Exoribonuclease 2 (EC 3.1.13.1) (Exoribonuclease II) (Ribonuclease II)
(RNase II).
"50 million years of genomic stasis in endosymbiotic bacteria.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in mRNA degradation. Hydrolyzes single-stranded
    polyribonucleotides processively in the 3' to 5' direction (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Exonucleolytic cleavage in the 3'- to 5'-
    direction to yield nucleoside 5'-phosphates.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribonuclease II (RNB) family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 S1 motif domain.
