AC   Q4UKF3;
Ribosome recycling factor (Ribosome-releasing factor) (RRF).
"The genome sequence of Rickettsia felis identifies the first putative
conjugative plasmid in an obligate intracellular parasite.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the release of ribosomes from messenger
    RNA at the termination of protein biosynthesis. May increase the
    efficiency of translation by recycling ribosomes from one round of
    translation to another (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RRF family.
 GO:0006415; P:translational termination; IEA:HAMAP.
