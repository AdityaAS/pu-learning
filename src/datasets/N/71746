Histone deacetylase 3 (HD3).
"Cloning and characterization of the murine histone deacetylase
(HDAC3).";
"Identification of a nuclear domain with deacetylase activity.";
"Tissue-specific regulation of retinal and pituitary precursor cell
proliferation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues on
    the N-terminal part of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4).
    Histone deacetylation gives a tag for epigenetic repression and
    plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle
    progression and developmental events. Histone deacetylases act via
    the formation of large multiprotein complexes. Required to repress
    transcription of the POU1F1 transcription factor (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with HDAC7. Forms a heterologous complex at
    least with YY1. Interacts with HDAC10, DAXX and DACH1. Found in a
    complex with NCOR1 and NCOR2. Component of the N-Cor repressor
    complex, at least composed of NCOR1, NCOR2, HDAC3, TBL1X, TBL1R,
    CORO2A and GPS2. Interacts with BCOR, MJD2A/JHDM3A and NRIP1 (By
    similarity).
