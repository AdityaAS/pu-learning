-!- FUNCTION: The production of the second messenger molecules
    diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is
    mediated by activated phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase
    C enzymes.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-
    bisphosphate + H(2)O = 1D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate +
    diacylglycerol.
-!- COFACTOR: Calcium.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=A;
      IsoId=Q9NQ66-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=B;
      IsoId=Q9NQ66-2; Sequence=VSP_004718;
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The receptor-mediated activation of PLC-beta 1 is
    mediated by two G-protein alpha subunits, alpha-Q and alpha-11.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 C2 domain.
