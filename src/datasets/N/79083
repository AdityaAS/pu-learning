Interleukin-12 receptor beta-2 chain precursor (IL-12 beta2 receptor)
(IL-12R-beta2).
"Cloning of porcine interleukin (IL)-12 receptor beta2 (IL-12Rbeta2)
gene and its application to a rapid biological assay for human/porcine
IL-12.";
"Limited effect of recombinant porcine interleukin-12 on porcine
lymphocytes due to a low level of IL-12 beta2 receptor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for interleukin-12. This subunit is the
    signaling component coupling to the JAK2/STAT4 pathway.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer/heteroligomer; disulfide-linked. The
    functional high affinity IL12 receptor is composed of I12RB1 and
    IL12RB2. Il12RB2 binds JAK2 (via its N-terminal) through a
    membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The WSXWS motif appears to be necessary for proper protein
    folding and thereby efficient intracellular transport and cell-
    surface receptor binding.
-!- DOMAIN: The box 1 motif is required for JAK interaction and/or
    activation.
-!- PTM: On IL12 stimulation, phosphorylated on C-terminal tyrosine
    residues (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family. Type 2
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 fibronectin type-III domains.
