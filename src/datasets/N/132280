expressed in interleukin-2-activated cytotoxic T-cells, epithelial
tumor cell lines, and the testes.";

-!- FUNCTION: Protein kinase that phosphorylates 'Ser-15' of p53/TP53
    protein and may therefore participate in its activation (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tyr protein kinase family. BUD32
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (AK013049) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 102.
