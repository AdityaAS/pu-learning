AC   P04730;
Gamma-gliadin (Gliadin B-III) (Fragment).
"Identification and DNA sequence analysis of a gamma-type gliadin cDNA
plasmid from winter wheat.";
-!- FUNCTION: Gliadin is the major seed storage protein in wheat.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The gamma-gliadins can be divided into 3 homology
    classes. Sequence divergence between the classes is due to single-
    base substitutions and to duplications or deletions within or near
    direct repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gliadin/glutenin family.
Repeat; Seed storage protein; Storage protein.
