AC   Q9JLH6;
CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1 (CDK5 activator-binding
protein C42).
"Cloning of three novel neuronal Cdk5 activator binding proteins.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Identification of a neuronal Cdk5 activator-binding protein as Cdk5
inhibitor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable regulator of CDK5 activity. May inhibit CDK5
    function via its interaction with CDK5R1.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster. The cluster is coordinated with
    3 cysteines and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine
    (Potential).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with CDK5R1 and CDK5R2. The interaction with
    CDK5R1 is prevented by the association between CDK5R1 and
    CDK5RAP2. Interacts also with the complex CDK5R1-CDK5. Does not
    interact with monomeric CDK5. The interaction is prevented by the
    association between CDK5R1 and CDK5RAP2.
-!- DOMAIN: The C-terminal part (475-586) is necessary for the
    interaction with CDK5R1, while the N-terminal part (1-168) is
    required for inhibiting the activity of the CDK5 kinase.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UPF0004 family. CDK5RAP1 subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 TRAM domain.
