AC   Q9XT56; Q5E9V8;
Junctional adhesion molecule A precursor (JAM-A) (Junctional adhesion
molecule 1) (JAM-1) (CD321 antigen).
"Combined treatment of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma causes redistribution
of junctional adhesion molecule in human endothelial cells.";
"Characterization of 954 bovine full-CDS cDNA sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to plays a role in epithelial tight junction
    formation. Appears early in primordial forms of cell junctions and
    recruits PARD3. The association of the PARD6-PARD3 complex may
    prevent the interaction of PARD3 with JAM1, thereby preventing
    tight junction assembly (By similarity). Plays a role in
    regulating monocyte transmigration involved in integrity of
    epithelial barrier. Involved in platelet activation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with the first PDZ domain of PARD3. The
    association between PARD3 and PARD6B probably disrupts this
    interaction. Interacts with the ninth PDZ domain of MPDZ (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell junction; tight junction; single-pass
    type I membrane protein (By similarity). Note=Localized at tight
    junctions of both epithelial and endothelial cells (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 Ig-like V-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domains.
