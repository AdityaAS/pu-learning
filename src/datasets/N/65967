-!- FUNCTION: Unknown. This retinoic acid-inducible G-protein coupled
    receptor provide evidence for a possible interaction between
    retinoid and G-protein signaling pathways (By similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    O95870:BAT5; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-348052, EBI-348517;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Cytoplasmic vesicle; cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein. Note=Localized in the plasma membrane and
    perinuclear vesicles.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expression is highest in the periphery,
    particularly in the stomach, but also in the kidney, liver,
    pancreas, and prostate. In brain, levels of expression are
    generally lower than in the periphery, with the exception of
    cerebellum, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG).
-!- INDUCTION: By all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 3 family.
