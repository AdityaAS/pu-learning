AC   Q32PI9;
Myelin protein zero-like protein 1 precursor.
-!- FUNCTION: Cell surface receptor, which is involved in signal
    transduction processes. Recruits PTPN11/SHP-2 to the cell membrane
    and is a putative substrate of PTPN11/SHP-2. Is a major receptor
    for concanavalin A (ConA) and is involved in cellular signaling
    induced by ConA, which probably includes Src family tyrosine-
    protein kinases. May be involved in regulation of integrin-
    mediated cell motility (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with phosphorylated PTPN11/SHP-2 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- DOMAIN: Contains 2 copies of a cytoplasmic motif that is referred
    to as the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitor motif (ITIM).
    This motif is involved in modulation of cellular responses. The
    phosphorylated ITIM motif can bind the SH2 domain of several SH2-
    containing phosphatases.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon stimulation with
    pervanadate and concanavalin A (ConA). Phosphorylation at Tyr-241
    and Tyr-263 is required for interaction with PTPN11/SHP-2.
    Dephosphorylated by PTPN11/SHP-2 (in vitro) (By similarity).
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the myelin P0 protein family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like V-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
