Protein arsC (Arsenate reductase) (EC 1.20.4.-) (Arsenical pump
modifier) (Low molecular weight protein-tyrosine-phosphatase)
(EC 3.1.3.48).
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: Reduces arsenate [As(V)] to arsenite [As(III)] and
    dephosphorylates tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, low-MW aryl
    phosphates and natural and synthetic acyl phosphates. Could switch
    between different functions in different circumstances (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein tyrosine phosphate + H(2)O = protein
    tyrosine + phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Arsenate + thioredoxin = arsenite +
    thioredoxin disulfide.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the low molecular weight phosphotyrosine
    protein phosphatase superfamily. ArsC family.
