Flagellar hook-associated protein 2 (HAP2) (Filament cap protein)
(Flagellar cap protein).
"The Bacillus subtilis sigma D-dependent operon encoding the flagellar
proteins FliD, FliS, and FliT.";
"Sequence of the Bacillus subtilis 168 chromosomal region from 305 to
307 degree.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the morphogenesis and for the elongation of
    the flagellar filament by facilitating polymerization of the
    flagellin monomers at the tip of growing filament. Forms a capping
    structure, which prevents flagellin subunits (transported through
    the central channel of the flagellum) from leaking out without
    polymerization at the distal end (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homopentamer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Flagellum.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fliD family.
