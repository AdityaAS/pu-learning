tubulin genes in Neurospora crassa.";

Neurospora genome sequence.";
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules. It
    binds two moles of GTP, one at an exchangeable site on the beta
    chain and one at a non-exchangeable site on the alpha-chain.
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer of alpha and beta chains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tubulin family.
GTP-binding; Microtubule; Nucleotide-binding.
