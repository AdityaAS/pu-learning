AC   Q64TQ1;
Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.12) (Aspartate--tRNA ligase)
(AspRS).
"Genomic analysis of Bacteroides fragilis reveals extensive DNA
inversions regulating cell surface adaptation.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-aspartate + tRNA(Asp) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-aspartyl-tRNA(Asp).
