AC   P97720;
Cytochrome P450 11B1, mitochondrial precursor (EC 1.14.15.4) (CYPXIB1)
(P450C11) (Steroid 11-beta-hydroxylase).
"The hamster adrenal cytochrome P450C11 has equipotent 11beta-
hydroxylase and 19-hydroxylase activities, but no aldosterone synthase
activity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Forms corticosterone from 11-deoxycorticosterone.
    Possesses high and nearly equal 11-beta-hydroxylase and 19-
    hydroxylase activities and a lower 18-hydroxylase activity.
    Involved in the formation of the precursor of 19-nor-
    deoxycorticosterone, a very potent mineralocorticoid involved in
    the development of essential hypertension.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A steroid + reduced adrenal ferredoxin + O(2)
    = an 11-beta-hydroxysteroid + oxidized adrenal ferredoxin + H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Glucocorticoid formation; last step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family.
 GO:0004507; F:steroid 11-beta-monooxygenase activity; IEA:EC.
