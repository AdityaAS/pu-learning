AC   O46689;
Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, mitochondrial precursor (StAR)
(StARD1).
"Human chorionic gonadotropin induces an inverse regulation of
steroidogenic acute regulatory protein messenger ribonucleic acid in
theca interna and granulosa cells of equine preovulatory follicles.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a key role in steroid hormone synthesis by
    enhancing the metabolism of cholesterol into pregnenolone.
    Mediates the transfer of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial
    membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane where it is cleaved
    to pregnenolone (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Steroidogenesis; rate-limiting step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 START domain.
Lipid transport; Lipid-binding; Mitochondrion; Phosphorylation;
Steroidogenesis; Transit peptide; Transport.
