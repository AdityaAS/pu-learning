AC   P56461;
Methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.9).
"The complete genome sequence of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter
pylori.";
-!- FUNCTION: Modifies the free amino group of the aminoacyl moiety of
    methionyl-tRNA(fMet). The formyl group appears to play a dual role
    in the initiator identity of N-formylmethionyl-tRNA by: (I)
    promoting its recognition by IF2 and (II) impairing its binding to
    EFTu-GTP (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 10-formyltetrahydrofolate + L-methionyl-
    tRNA(fMet) + H(2)O = tetrahydrofolate + N-formylmethionyl-
    tRNA(fMet).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fmt family.
