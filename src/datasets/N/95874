AC   P01703;
Ig lambda chain V-I region NEWM.
"Amino acid sequence of the (lambda) light chain of a human myeloma
immunoglobulin (IgG New).";
"Preliminary refinement and structural analysis of the Fab fragment
from human immunoglobulin new at 2.0-A resolution.";
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The structure of the Fab fragment of the IgG1
    myeloma protein newm was determined.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The absence of seven residues found in other lambda
    chains was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The C region of this chain has the OZ+ marker.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like (immunoglobulin-like) domain.
