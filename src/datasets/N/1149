AC   P29810;
Aminoglycoside N(3')-acetyltransferase IX (EC 2.3.1.81) (ACC(3)-IX)
(Aminocyclitol 3-N-acetyltransferase type IX).
"Characterisation of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase-encoding genes
of neomycin-producing Micromonospora chalcea and Streptomyces
fradiae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Resistance to neomycin.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + a 2-deoxystreptamine antibiotic =
    CoA + N(3')-acetyl-2-deoxystreptamine antibiotic.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the antibiotic N-acetyltransferase family.
