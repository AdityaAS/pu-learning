AC   Q6YQA4;
tRNA (guanine-N(1)-)-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.31) (M1G-
methyltransferase) (tRNA [GM37] methyltransferase).
"Reductive evolution suggested from the complete genome sequence of a
plant-pathogenic phytoplasma.";
-!- FUNCTION: Specifically methylates guanosine-37 in various tRNAs
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA = S-adenosyl-L-
    homocysteine + tRNA containing 1-N-methylguanine.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA methyltransferase trmD family.
