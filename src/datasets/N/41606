-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Succinate + ubiquinone = fumarate + ubiquinol.
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate metabolism; tricarboxylic acid cycle.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms part of complex II containing four subunits: a
    flavoprotein (FP), an iron-sulfur protein (IP) and a cytochrome b
    composed of two integral membrane proteins (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FAD-dependent oxidoreductase 2 family.
    FRD/SDH subfamily.
