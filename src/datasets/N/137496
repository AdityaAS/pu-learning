AC   P0A440; P38480;
Formyltetrahydrofolate deformylase (EC 3.5.1.10) (Formyl-FH(4)
hydrolase).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces formate from formyl-tetrahydrofolate. Provides
    the major source of formate for the purT-dependent synthesis of
    5'-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide (FGAR) during aerobic
    growth. Has a role in regulating the one-carbon pool.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 10-formyltetrahydrofolate + H(2)O = formate +
    tetrahydrofolate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by methionine, inhibited by glycine
    (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; IMP biosynthesis; formate from
    10-formyltetrahydrofolate: single step.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Purine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homohexamer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the purU family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ACT domain.
Complete proteome; Hydrolase; One-carbon metabolism;
