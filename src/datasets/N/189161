-!- FUNCTION: Complexes with metalloproteinases (such as collagenases)
    and irreversibly inactivates them.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- PTM: The activity of TIMP2 is dependent on the presence of
    disulfide bonds.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the protease inhibitor I35 (TIMP) family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 NTR domain.
