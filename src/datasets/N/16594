AC   Q6G664;
Choline dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.1) (CHD) (CDH).
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: Can catalyze the oxidation of choline to betaine
    aldehyde and betaine aldehyde to glycine betaine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Choline + acceptor = betaine aldehyde +
    reduced acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amine and polyamine biosynthesis; betaine biosynthesis;
    betaine aldehyde from choline (dehydrogenase route): single step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GMC oxidoreductase family.
Complete proteome; FAD; Flavoprotein; Oxidoreductase.
