AC   Q8E794;
Glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30) (ATP:glycerol 3-phosphotransferase)
(Glycerokinase) (GK).
"Genome sequence of Streptococcus agalactiae, a pathogen causing
invasive neonatal disease.";
-!- FUNCTION: Key enzyme in the regulation of glycerol uptake and
    metabolism.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + glycerol = ADP + sn-glycerol 3-
    phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycerol utilization; first (rate-limiting) step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FGGY kinase family.
 GO:0005524; F:ATP binding; IEA:HAMAP.
