-!- FUNCTION: Transcription factor that is thought to be involved in
    regulation of organogenesis. May be involved in determination and
    maintenance of retina formation. Binds a 5'-GGTGTCAG-3' motif
    present in the ARE regulatory element of ATP1A1. Binds a 5'-
    TCA[AG][AG]TTNC-3' motif present in the MEF3 element in the
    myogenin promoter, and in the IGFBP5 promoter (By similarity).
    Thought to be regulated by association with Dach and Eya proteins,
    and seems to be coactivated by EYA1, EYA2 and EYA3 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Probably binds DNA dimer. Interacts with EYA3, and
    probably EYA1 and EYA2 (By similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P54253:ATXN1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-946167, EBI-930964;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q8N196-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q8N196-2; Sequence=VSP_010072;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in adult but not in fetal eyes.
    Found in corneal epithelium and endothelium, lens epithelium,
    ciliary body epithelia, cellular layers of the retina and the
    sclera.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: At the begin of fourth week of development
    detected in cytoplasm of somite cells, and at the end of fourth
    week is accumulated in the nucleus. Between the sixth and eighth
    week of development detected in the nucleus of limb bud cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SIX/Sine oculis homeobox family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 homeobox DNA-binding domain.
-!- CAUTION: The region from 1 to 184 was deduced from the genomic
    sequence and ESTs.
