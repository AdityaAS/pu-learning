AC   Q9BBS3;
ATP synthase subunit alpha (EC 3.6.3.14) (ATPase subunit alpha) (ATP
synthase F1 sector subunit alpha).
"Complete structure of the chloroplast genome of a legume, Lotus
japonicus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton
    gradient across the membrane. The alpha chain is a regulatory
    subunit.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + H(2)O + H(+)(In) = ADP + phosphate +
    H(+)(Out).
-!- SUBUNIT: F-type ATPases have 2 components, CF(1) - the catalytic
    core - and CF(0) - the membrane proton channel. CF(1) has five
    subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0)
    has four main subunits: a, b, b' and c (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
