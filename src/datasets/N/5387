AC   Q29490;
Aldehyde dehydrogenase, cytosolic 1 (EC 1.2.1.3) (ALDH class 1) (ETA-
crystallin).
"A retinaldehyde dehydrogenase as a structural protein in a mammalian
eye lens. Gene recruitment of eta-crystallin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Major component of the eye of elephant shrews, which in
    contrast to other mammals, possesses both a lens- and a non-lens
    class-1 aldehyde dehydrogenase 1. This eye-specific form is a
    structural protein of the lens and, in other part of the eye,
    serves as the major form of ALDH1. Can convert/oxidize
    retinaldehyde to retinoic acid.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: An aldehyde + NAD(+) + H(2)O = an acid + NADH.
-!- PATHWAY: Ethanol utilization; second step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Eye specific, with very high expression in the
    lens.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family.
