AC   Q9JVY4;
Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.5) (Isoleucine--tRNA ligase)
(IleRS).
"Complete DNA sequence of a serogroup A strain of Neisseria
meningitidis Z2491.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the attachment of isoleucine to tRNA(Ile). As
    IleRS can inadvertently accommodate and process structurally
    similar amino acids such as valine, to avoid such errors it has
    two additional distinct tRNA(Ile)-dependent editing activities.
    One activity is designated as 'pretransfer' editing and involves
    the hydrolysis of activated Val-AMP. The other activity is
    designated 'posttransfer' editing and involves deacylation of
    mischarged Val-tRNA(Ile) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-isoleucine + tRNA(Ile) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-isoleucyl-tRNA(Ile).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: IleRS has two distinct active sites: one for
    aminoacylation and one for editing. The misactivated valine is
    translocated from the active site to the editing site, which
    sterically excludes the correctly activated isoleucine. The single
    editing site contains two valyl binding pockets, one specific for
    each substrate (Val-AMP or Val-tRNA(Ile)) (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family. IleS type 1 subfamily.
