-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the interconversion between ADP-D-glycero-
    beta-D-manno-heptose and ADP-L-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose via an
    epimerization at carbon 6 of the heptose.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ADP-D-glycero-D-manno-heptose = ADP-L-glycero-
    D-manno-heptose.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 NADP(+) per subunit. NAD(+) can substitute for
    NADP(+), but enzymatic activity is reduced.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Completely inhibited by ADP and ADP-glucose,
    and partially inhibited by ATP and NADH.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=0.1 mM for ADP-heptose;
      Vmax=1.53 umol/min/mg enzyme;
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 5.5-9.5;
    Temperature dependence:
      Optimum temperature is 42 degrees Celsius;
-!- PATHWAY: Inner core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis; ADP-L-
    glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose biosynthesis; fifth (last) step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homopentamer.

    P0A8C1:ybjQ; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-543760, EBI-544395;
-!- INDUCTION: By heat shock.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains a large N-terminal NADP-binding domain associated
    with a modified Rossman fold, and a smaller C-terminal substrate-
    binding domain.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Essential for Escherichia coli viability at
    elevated temperatures. Insertional inactivation of the gene by the
    Tn5 transposon results in E.coli being unable to form colonies at
    temperatures above 43 degrees Celsius.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sugar epimerase family. HldD subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.8) thought to be a homohexamer.
