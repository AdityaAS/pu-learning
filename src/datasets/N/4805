-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in weight homeostasis. May play a role in
    the regulation of melanocortin receptors within the hypothalamus
    and adrenal gland, and therefore in the central control of
    feeding.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed primarily in the adrenal gland,
    subthalamic nucleus, and hypothalamus, with a lower level of
    expression occurring in testis, lung, and kidney.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in AGRP may be a cause of autosomal dominant
    obesity [MIM:601665].
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 agouti domain.
