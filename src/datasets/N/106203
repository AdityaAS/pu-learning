UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvoylglucosamine reductase (EC 1.1.1.158) (UDP-N-
acetylmuramate dehydrogenase).
"Complete genome sequence of the alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus
halodurans and genomic sequence comparison with Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cell wall formation (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-N-acetylmuramate + NADP(+) = UDP-N-acetyl-
    3-O-(1-carboxyvinyl)-D-glucosamine + NADPH.
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Glycan biosynthesis; peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the murB family.
