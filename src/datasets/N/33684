      IsoId=Q9H8E8-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q9H8E8-2; Sequence=VSP_000070;
      Note=May be due to an intron retention;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, lung,
    placenta, brain, liver, pancreas and kidney. High expression in
    skeletal muscle and heart. Lower expression in lung.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 N-acetyltransferase domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (CAB56651) sequence differs from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
