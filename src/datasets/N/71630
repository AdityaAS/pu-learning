AC   Q02281; O84748; Q9R5S5;
Histone H1-like protein Hc1 (18 kDa histone analog).
"Identification and nucleotide sequence of a developmentally regulated
gene encoding a eukaryotic histone H1-like protein from Chlamydia
trachomatis.";
"Chlamydia trachomatis developmentally regulated protein is homologous
to eukaryotic histone H1.";
"Genome sequence of an obligate intracellular pathogen of humans:
Chlamydia trachomatis.";
"Purification and N-terminal amino acid sequences of Chlamydia
trachomatis histone analogs.";
-!- FUNCTION: Might have a role analogous to that of eukaryotic
    histone proteins.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Specific to the EB (elementary body) form in
    the life cycle of chlamydiae.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the histone H1/H5 family. HCT subfamily.
