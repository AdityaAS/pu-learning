AC   Q2NH88;
Replication factor C large subunit (RFC large subunit) (Clamp loader
large subunit).
"The genome sequence of Methanosphaera stadtmanae reveals why this
human intestinal archaeon is restricted to methanol and H2 for methane
formation and ATP synthesis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the RFC clamp loader complex which loads the
    PCNA sliding clamp onto DNA (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heteromultimer composed of small subunits (rfcS) and
    large subunits (rfcL) (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the activator 1 small subunits family. RfcL
    subfamily.
