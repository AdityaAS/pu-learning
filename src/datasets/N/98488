AC   P32094;
mRNA capping enzyme (mRNA guanylyltransferase) (EC 2.7.7.50) (GTP--RNA
guanylyltransferase) (GTase).
"African swine fever virus guanylyltransferase.";
"Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence of African swine fever
virus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the second reaction in the mRNA cap formation
    pathway.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: GTP + (5')pp-Pur-mRNA = diphosphate +
    G(5')ppp-Pur-mRNA.
-!- PATHWAY: mRNA cap formation; second step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the viral GTase family.
