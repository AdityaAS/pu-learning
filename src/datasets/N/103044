-!- FUNCTION: Transport of phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes from the
    Golgi complex and the cell surface to lysosomes. Lysosomal enzymes
    bearing phosphomannosyl residues bind specifically to mannose-6-
    phosphate receptors in the Golgi apparatus and the resulting
    receptor-ligand complex is transported to an acidic prelyosomal
    compartment where the low pH mediates the dissociation of the
    complex.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Binds GGA1, GGA2 and GGA3 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Lysosome; lysosomal membrane; single-pass
    type I membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The extracellular domain is homologous to the repeating
    units (of approximately 147 AA) of the cation-independent mannose
    6-phosphate receptor.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This receptor has optimal binding in the presence
    of divalent cations.
