AC   P23196;
DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase (EC 4.2.99.18) (AP
endonuclease 1) (APEX nuclease) (APEN).
"Isolation of cDNA clones encoding an enzyme from bovine cells that
repairs oxidative DNA damage in vitro: homology with bacterial repair
enzymes.";
"Purification and amino-terminal amino acid sequence of an
apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease from calf thymus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Repairs oxidative DNA damages in vitro. May have a role
    in protection against cell lethality and suppression of mutations.
    Removes the blocking groups from the 3' termini of the DNA strand
    breaks generated by ionizing radiations and bleomycin.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: The C-O-P bond 3' to the apurinic or
    apyrimidinic site in DNA is broken by a beta-elimination reaction,
    leaving a 3'-terminal unsaturated sugar and a product with a
    terminal 5'-phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer. Component of the SET complex, which also
    contains SET, ANP32A, HMGB2 and NME1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Thymus.
-!- INDUCTION: By several DNA damaging agents.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA repair enzymes AP/exoA family.
