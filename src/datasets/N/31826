AC   P30612;
Cytochrome P450 52C1 (EC 1.14.14.-) (CYPLIIC1) (Alkane-inducible P450-
ALK7).
"Identification and characterization of additional members of the
cytochrome P450 multigene family CYP52 of Candida tropicalis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Together with an NADPH cytochrome P450 the enzyme system
    catalyzes the terminal hydroxylation as the first step in the
    assimilation of alkanes and fatty acids.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydroxylation of N-alkanes at the terminal
    position.
-!- INDUCTION: By various alkanes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family.
