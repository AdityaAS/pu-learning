AC   Q5YTD8;
Pyridoxal biosynthesis lyase pdxS (EC 4.-.-.-).
"The complete genomic sequence of Nocardia farcinica IFM 10152.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the production of pyridoxal phosphate,
    probably by incorporating ammonia into the pyridine ring (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; pyridoxal 5'-phosphate
    biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a complex with pdxT (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pdxS/SNZ family.
