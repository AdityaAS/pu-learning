-!- FUNCTION: Participates in the innate immune response to microbial
    agents. Detects the unmethylated cytidine-phosphate-guanosine
    (CpG) motifs present in bacterial DNA. Acts via MyD88 and TRAF6,
    leading to NF-kappa-B activation, cytokine secretion and the
    inflammatory response.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds MyD88 via their respective TIR domains (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (By similarity).

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in spleen, lymph node, tonsil
    and peripheral blood leukocytes, especially in plasmacytoid pre-
    dendritic cells. Levels are much lower in monocytes and CD11c+
    immature dendritic cells. Also detected in lung and liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Toll-like receptor family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 26 LRR (leucine-rich) repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 TIR domain.
