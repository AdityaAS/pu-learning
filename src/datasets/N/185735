TATA-box-binding protein 2 (TATA-box factor 2) (TATA-binding factor 2)
(TATA sequence-binding protein 2) (TBP-2) (Transcription initiation
factor TFIID TBP-2 subunit).
"Wheat TFIID TATA binding protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: General transcription factor that functions at the core
    of the DNA-binding multiprotein factor TFIID. Binding of TFIID to
    the TATA box is the initial transcriptional step of the pre-
    initiation complex (PIC), playing a role in the activation of
    eukaryotic genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II.
-!- SUBUNIT: Belongs to the TFIID complex together with the TBP-
    associated factors (TAFs). Binds DNA as monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TBP family.
DNA-binding; Nuclear protein; Repeat; Transcription.
