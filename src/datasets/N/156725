Ribonuclease PH (EC 2.7.7.56) (RNase PH) (tRNA
nucleotidyltransferase).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Phosphorolytic exoribonuclease that removes nucleotide
    residues following the -CCA terminus of tRNA and adds nucleotides
    to the ends of RNA molecules by using nucleoside diphosphates as
    substrates. Also acts to regulate the attenuation of pyrE (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: tRNA(n+1) + phosphate = tRNA(n) + a nucleoside
    diphosphate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNase PH family.
