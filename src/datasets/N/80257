Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (Eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha) (eIF-2-alpha) (EIF-
2alpha) (EIF-2A).
"Isolation and characterisation of a bovine cDNA encoding eukaryotic
initiation factor 2 alpha.";
-!- FUNCTION: Functions in the early steps of protein synthesis by
    forming a ternary complex with GTP and initiator tRNA. This
    complex binds to a 40S ribosomal subunit, followed by mRNA binding
    to form a 43S preinitiation complex. Junction of the 60S ribosomal
    subunit to form the 80S initiation complex is preceded by
    hydrolysis of the GTP bound to eIF-2 and release of an eIF-2-GDP
    binary complex. In order for eIF-2 to recycle and catalyze another
    round of initiation, the GDP bound to eIF-2 must exchange with GTP
    by way of a reaction catalyzed by eIF-2B.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimer composed of an alpha, a beta and a gamma
    chain.
-!- PTM: Substrate for at least 4 kinases: EIF2AK3/PERK, GCN2, HRI and
    PKR. Phosphorylation stabilizes the eIF-2/GDP/eIF-2B complex and
    prevents GDP/GTP exchange reaction, thus impairing the recycling
    of eIF-2 between successive rounds of initiation and leading to
    global inhibition of translation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eIF-2-alpha family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 S1 motif domain.
