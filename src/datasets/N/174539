AC   Q8XIR5;
Anti-sigma F factor (EC 2.7.11.1) (Stage II sporulation protein AB).
"Complete genome sequence of Clostridium perfringens, an anaerobic
flesh-eater.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to sigma F and blocks its ability to form an RNA
    polymerase holoenzyme (E-sigma F). Phosphorylates SpoIIAA on a
    serine residue. This phosphorylation may enable SpoIIAA to act as
    an anti-anti-sigma factor that counteracts SpoIIAB and thus
    releases sigma F from inhibition (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the anti-sigma-factor family.
