ADP-ribosylation factor 6.
"Interspecies relationships among ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs):
evidence of evolutionary pressure to maintain individual identities.";
"Identification of a new Pyk2 target protein with Arf-GAP activity.";
-!- FUNCTION: GTP-binding protein that functions as an allosteric
    activator of the cholera toxin catalytic subunit, an ADP-
    ribosyltransferase. Involved in protein trafficking; may modulate
    vesicle budding and uncoating within the Golgi apparatus (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with DDEF2, PIP5K1C and UACA (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small GTPase superfamily. Arf family.
