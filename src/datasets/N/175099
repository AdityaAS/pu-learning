Spermidine synthase (EC 2.5.1.16) (Putrescine aminopropyltransferase)
(SPDSY).

localization.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosylmethioninamine + putrescine = 5'-
    methylthioadenosine + spermidine.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: The activity is thought to be regulated mainly
    by the availability of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine.
-!- PATHWAY: Amine and polyamine biosynthesis; spermidine
    biosynthesis; spermidine from putrescine: single step [final
    step].
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the spermidine/spermine synthase family.
