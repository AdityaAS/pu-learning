AC   P30426;
Bradykinin-potentiating peptide S5,1 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor).
"Primary structure and biological activity of bradykinin potentiating
peptides from Bothrops insularis snake venom.";
-!- FUNCTION: This peptide both inhibits the activity of the
    angiotensin-converting enzyme and enhances the action of
    bradykinin by inhibiting the kinases that inactivate it. It acts
    as an indirect hypotensive agent.
Direct protein sequencing; Hypotensive agent;
