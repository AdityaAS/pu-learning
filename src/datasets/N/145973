AC   Q9KFH7;
Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit beta (EC 1.17.4.1)
(Ribonucleotide reductase small subunit).
"Complete genome sequence of the alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus
halodurans and genomic sequence comparison with Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Provides the precursors necessary for DNA synthesis.
    Catalyzes the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides from the
    corresponding ribonucleotides (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2'-deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate +
    thioredoxin disulfide + H(2)O = ribonucleoside diphosphate +
    thioredoxin.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 iron ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Genetic information processing; DNA replication.
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta subunits (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase
    small chain family.
Complete proteome; DNA replication; Iron; Metal-binding;
Oxidoreductase.
