-!- FUNCTION: Calcium-independent receptor of low affinity for alpha-
    latrotoxin, an excitatory neurotoxin present in black widow spider
    venom which triggers massive exocytosis from neurons and
    neuroendocrine cells. Receptor propably implicated in the
    regulation of exocytosis (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a heterodimer, consisting of a large extracellular
    region (p120) non-covalently linked to a seven-transmembrane
    moiety (p85) (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed very widely in all normal tissues
    tested. Expression is variable in tumor cell lines, apparently
    elevated in some lines and absent or markedly reduced in others.
-!- PTM: Proteolytically cleaved into 2 subunits, an extracellular
    subunit and a seven-transmembrane subunit (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 2 family.
    LN-TM7 subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 GPS domain.
