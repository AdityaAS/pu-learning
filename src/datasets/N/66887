AC   P21765;
Epididymal secretory glutathione peroxidase precursor (EC 1.11.1.9)
(Epididymis-specific glutathione peroxidase-like protein) (EGLP)
(Major androgen-regulated protein) (arMEP24).
"Androgen-dependent protein secreted by mouse caput epididymis shows
high homologies with different glutathione peroxidases.";
"Structural organization and regulation of the gene for the androgen-
dependent glutathione peroxidase-like protein specific to the mouse
epididymis.";
"A mouse cDNA sequence for epididymal androgen-regulated proteins
related to glutathione peroxidase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Protects cells and enzymes from oxidative damage, by
    catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxides and
    organic hydroperoxide, by glutathione. May constitute a
    glutathionine peroxidase-like protective system against peroxide
    damage in sperm membrane lipids.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 glutathione + H(2)O(2) = glutathione
    disulfide + 2 H(2)O.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Epididymis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glutathione peroxidase family.
Oxidoreductase; Peroxidase; Signal.
