AC   Q30SN2;
Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.1) (Tyrosine--tRNA ligase) (TyrRS).
"Complete sequence of Thiomicrospira denitrificans ATCC 33889.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the attachment of tyrosine to tRNA(Tyr) in a
    two-step reaction: tyrosine is first activated by ATP to form Tyr-
    AMP and then transferred to the acceptor end of tRNA(Tyr) (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-tyrosine + tRNA(Tyr) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-tyrosyl-tRNA(Tyr).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family. TyrS type 2 subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 S4 RNA-binding domain.
