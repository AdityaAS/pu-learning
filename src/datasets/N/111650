AC   Q44045;
Nitrogenase molybdenum-iron protein alpha chain (EC 1.18.6.1)
(Nitrogenase component I) (Dinitrogenase).
-!- FUNCTION: This molybdenum-iron protein is part of the nitrogenase
    complex that catalyzes the key enzymatic reactions in nitrogen
    fixation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 8 reduced ferredoxin + 8 H(+) + N(2) + 16 ATP
    + 16 H(2)O = 8 oxidized ferredoxin + H(2) + 2 NH(3) + 16 ADP + 16
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 8Fe-7S cluster per heterodimer (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 7Fe-Mo-9S-X-homocitryl cluster per subunit. The
    identity of the X atom is not known, possibly carbon or oxygen (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta chains. Forms complex
    with the iron protein (nitrogenase component 2).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nifD/nifK/nifE/nifN family.
