AC   Q6P0U9;
Nucleoporin-like 2.
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the export of mRNAs containing poly(A)
    tails from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Probable component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nuclear pore complex; cytoplasmic
    side (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The FG repeats are interaction sites for karyopherins
    (importins, exportins) and form probably an affinity gradient,
    guiding the transport proteins unidirectionally with their cargo
    through the NPC (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 C3H1-type zinc finger.
