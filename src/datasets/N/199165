AC   Q8FQX3;
Urease subunit beta (EC 3.5.1.5) (Urea amidohydrolase subunit beta).
"Comparative complete genome sequence analysis of the amino acid
replacements responsible for the thermostability of Corynebacterium
efficiens.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Urea + H(2)O = CO(2) + 2 NH(3).
-!- PATHWAY: Nitrogen metabolism; urea degradation; CO(2) and NH(3)
    from urea (urease route): single step [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimer of ureA (gamma), ureB (beta) and ureC
    (alpha) subunits. Three heterotrimers associate to form the active
    enzyme (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the urease beta subunit family.
Complete proteome; Hydrolase.
