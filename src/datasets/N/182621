AC   Q2K975;
Arginyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.19) (Arginine--tRNA ligase) (ArgRS).
"The partitioned Rhizobium etli genome: genetic and metabolic
redundancy in seven interacting replicons.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-arginine + tRNA(Arg) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-arginyl-tRNA(Arg).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
