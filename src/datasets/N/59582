Putative polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 9 (EC 2.4.1.41)
(Protein-UDP acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 9) (UDP-
GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 9) (pp-GaNTase
9).

-!- FUNCTION: May catalyze the initial reaction in O-linked
    oligosaccharide biosynthesis, the transfer of an N-acetyl-D-
    galactosamine residue to a serine or threonine residue on the
    protein receptor (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine + polypeptide =
    UDP + N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyl-polypeptide.
-!- COFACTOR: Manganese (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Calcium (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Glycosylation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane;
    single-pass type II membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: There are two conserved domains in the glycosyltransferase
    region: the N-terminal domain (domain A, also called GT1 motif),
    which is probably involved in manganese coordination and substrate
    binding and the C-terminal domain (domain B, also called
    Gal/GalNAc-T motif), which is probably involved in catalytic
    reaction and UDP-Gal binding (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The ricin B-type lectin domain binds to GalNAc and
    contributes to the glycopeptide specificity (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 2 family. GalNAc-T
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ricin B-type lectin domain.
