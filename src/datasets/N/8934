AC   Q9ZPY6;
Auxin response factor 11.
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 2 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Auxin-responsive gene expression: genes, promoters and regulatory
factors.";
-!- FUNCTION: Auxin response factors (ARFs) are transcriptional
    factors that binds specifically to the DNA sequence 5'-TGTCTC-3'
    found in the auxin-responsive promoter elements (AuxREs). Could
    act as transcriptional activator or repressor. Formation of
    heterodimers with Aux/IAA proteins may alter their ability to
    modulate early auxin response genes expression.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homo and heterodimers (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- DOMAIN: Interactions between auxin response factors (ARFs) and
    Aux/IAA proteins occur through their C-terminal dimerization
    domains III and IV.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ARF family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Aux/IAA-ARF domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 TF-B3 DNA-binding domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequences differ from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
