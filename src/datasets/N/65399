AC   P30669;
Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(s) subunit alpha (Adenylate
cyclase-stimulating G alpha protein).
"Cloning and characterization of a cDNA coding for the alpha-subunit
of a stimulatory G protein from Schistosoma mansoni.";
-!- FUNCTION: Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are
    involved as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane
    signaling systems. The G(s) protein is involved in hormonal
    regulation of adenylate cyclase: it activates the cyclase in
    response to beta-adrenergic stimuli.
-!- SUBUNIT: G proteins are composed of 3 units; alpha, beta and
    gamma. The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding
    site.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-alpha family. G(s) subfamily.
ADP-ribosylation; GTP-binding; Nucleotide-binding; Transducer.
