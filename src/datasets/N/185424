AC   Q9ZRB2;
Tubulin beta-1 chain (Beta-1 tubulin).
"Tubb1, a beta-tubulin cDNA from common wheat.";
-!- FUNCTION: Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules. It
    binds two moles of GTP, one at an exchangeable site on the beta
    chain and one at a non-exchangeable site on the alpha-chain.
