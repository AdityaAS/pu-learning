-!- FUNCTION: Cadherins are calcium dependent cell adhesion proteins.
    They preferentially interact with themselves in a homophilic
    manner in connecting cells. Cadherin 23 may function as hair
    bundle organizer perhaps by cross-linking the stereocilia (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (By similarity).

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Particularly strong expression in the retina.
    Found also in the cochlea.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in CDH23 are the cause of Usher syndrome type 1D
    (USH1D) [MIM:601067]. Usher syndrome type 1 is an autosomal
    recessive disorder characterized by congenital profound
    sensorineural hearing loss, constant vestibular dysfunction and
    prepubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa leading to blindness.
    Usher syndrome is the most common cause of combined deafness and
    blindness in developed countries.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in CDH23 are the cause of a form of non-syndromic
    autosomal recessive deafness (DFNB12) [MIM:601386].
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 27 cadherin domains.
