(Fragments).
"Separation and characterization of needle and xylem maritime pine
proteins.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + D-ribulose 5-phosphate = ADP + D-
    ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Light regulated via thioredoxin by reversible
    oxidation/reduction of sulfhydryl/disulfide groups (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate biosynthesis; Calvin cycle.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: On the 2D-gel the determined pI of this protein
    (spot N148) is: 5.6, its MW is: 37 kDa.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphoribulokinase family.
