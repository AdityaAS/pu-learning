AC   P31428;
Dipeptidase 1 precursor (EC 3.4.13.19) (Microsomal dipeptidase) (Renal
dipeptidase) (Membrane-bound dipeptidase 1) (MBD-1).
"Purification and molecular cloning of mouse renal dipeptidase.";
"Identification of two additional members of the membrane-bound
dipeptidase family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Hydrolyzes a wide range of dipeptides. Implicated in the
    renal metabolism of glutathione and its conjugates. Converts
    leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4; it may play an important role in
    the regulation of leukotriene activity.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of dipeptides.
-!- COFACTOR: Zinc.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by L-penicillamine.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=10 uM for leukotriene D4;
      KM=0.45 mM for cystinyl-bis-glycine;
      KM=111 uM for beta-lactam;
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer; disulfide-linked.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; apical cell membrane; lipid-
    anchor; GPI-anchor. Note=Brush border membrane.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M19 family.
