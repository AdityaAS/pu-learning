AC   P12227;
DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta'' chain (EC 2.7.7.6) (PEP) (Plastid-
encoded RNA polymerase beta'' subunit) (RNA polymerase beta'' subunit)
(Fragment).
"Pea chloroplast DNA encodes homologues of Escherichia coli ribosomal
subunit S2 and the beta'-subunit of RNA polymerase.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription
    of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as
    substrates.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: In plastids the minimal PEP RNA polymerase catalytic core
    is composed of four subunits: alpha, beta, beta', and beta''. When
    a (nuclear-encoded) sigma factor is associated with the core the
    holoenzyme is formed, which can initiate transcription (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA polymerase beta' chain family.
    RpoC2 subfamily.
