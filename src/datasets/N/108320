-!- FUNCTION: Component of the sarcomere that tethers together nebulin
    (skeletal muscle) and nebulette (cardiac muscle) to alpha-actinin,
    at the Z lines (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with TTN/titin, NEB, NEBL, ACTN2 and CARP (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus (By similarity).
    Note=Bound to sarcomere both at the Z-line periphery and in the
    central I-band region.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 Ig-like (immunoglobulin-like) domains.
Actin-binding; Coiled coil; Immunoglobulin domain; Nuclear protein;
Phosphorylation; Repeat.
