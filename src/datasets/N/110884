AC   P56730; Q9UP16;
Neurotrypsin precursor (EC 3.4.21.-) (Serine protease 12) (Motopsin)
(Leydin).
"Cloning and sequencing of the cDNA encoding human neurotrypsin.";
"Cloning and structural analysis of leydin, a novel human serine
protease expressed by the Leydig cells of the testis.";
"Truncating neurotrypsin mutation in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic
mental retardation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in neuronal plasticity and the proteolytic
    action may subserve structural reorganizations associated with
    learning and memory operations (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brian and Leydig cells of the testis.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in PRSS12 are a cause of autosomal recessive
    nonsyndromic mental retardation [MIM:249500]. Mental retardation
    is a mental disorder characterized by significantly subaverage
    general intellectual functioning associated with impairments in
    adaptative behavior and manifested during the developmental
    period.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase S1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 kringle domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase S1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 SRCR domains.
