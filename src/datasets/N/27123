AC   Q9CKC0;
Chaperone clpB.
"Complete genomic sequence of Pasteurella multocida Pm70.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a stress-induced multi-chaperone system, it is
    involved in the recovery of the cell from heat-induced damage, in
    cooperation with dnaK, dnaJ and grpE. Acts before dnaK, in the
    processing of protein aggregates. Protein binding stimulates the
    ATPase activity; ATP hydrolysis unfolds the denatured protein
    aggregates, which probably helps expose new hydrophobic binding
    sites on the surface of clpB-bound aggregates, contributing to the
    solubilization and refolding of denatured protein aggregates by
    dnaK (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homohexamer. The oligomerization is ATP-dependent (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal domain probably functions as a substrate-
    discriminating domain, recruiting aggregated proteins to the clpB
    hexamer and/or stabilizing bound proteins. The NBD2 domain is
    responsible for oligomerization, whereas the NBD1 domain
    stabilizes the hexamer probably in an ATP-dependent manner. The
    movement of the coiled-coil domain is essential for clpB ability
    to rescue proteins from an aggregated state, probably by pulling
    apart large aggregated proteins, which are bound between the
    coiled-coils motifs of adjacent clpB subunits in the functional
    hexamer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the clpA/clpB family.
