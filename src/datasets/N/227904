AC   P26830;
Putative peroxiredoxin in NDH 5' region (EC 1.11.1.15) (Thioredoxin
reductase) (Fragment).
"Nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding NADH dehydrogenase from an
alkalophile, Bacillus sp. strain YN-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Reduces peroxides. May play an important role in
    eliminating peroxides generated during metabolism (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 R'-SH + ROOH = R'-S-S-R' + H(2)O + ROH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer; disulfide-linked, upon oxidation (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: The Cys-28-SH group is the primary site of oxidation by
    H(2)O(2), and the oxidized Cys-28 (probably Cys-SOH) rapidly
    reacts with Cys-147-SH of the other subunit to form an
    intermolecular disulfide. This disulfide is subsequently reduced
    by thioredoxin (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ahpC/TSA family.
