AC   P06594;
Phytochrome A type 4 (AP4).
"Analysis of cloned cDNA and genomic sequences for phytochrome:
complete amino acid sequences for two gene products expressed in
etiolated Avena.";
"The amino-terminal structure of oat phytochrome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Regulatory photoreceptor which exists in two forms that
    are reversibly interconvertible by light: the Pr form that absorbs
    maximally in the red region of the spectrum and the Pfr form that
    absorbs maximally in the far-red region. Photoconversion of Pr to
    Pfr induces an array of morphogenic responses, whereas
    reconversion of Pfr to Pr cancels the induction of those
    responses. Pfr controls the expression of a number of nuclear
    genes including those encoding the small subunit of ribulose-
    bisphosphate carboxylase, chlorophyll A/B binding protein,
    protochlorophyllide reductase, rRNA, etc. It also controls the
    expression of its own gene(s) in a negative feedback fashion.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- PTM: Contains one covalently linked phytochromobilin chromophore.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phytochrome family.
