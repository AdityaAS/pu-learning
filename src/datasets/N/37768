AC   Q6LM58;
Sulfite reductase [NADPH] flavoprotein alpha-component (EC 1.8.1.2)
(SIR-FP).
"Life at depth: Photobacterium profundum genome sequence and
expression analysis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the 6-electron reduction of sulfite to
    sulfide. This is one of several activities required for the
    biosynthesis of L-cysteine from sulfate. The flavo-protein
    component catalyzes the electron flow from NADPH -> FAD -> FMN to
    the hemoprotein component (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: H(2)S + 3 NADP(+) + 3 H(2)O = sulfite + 3
    NADPH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FMN per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Alpha(8)-beta(8). The alpha component is a flavoprotein,
    the beta component is a hemoprotein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 flavodoxin-like domain.
