(EC 2.4.2.-) (Monofunctional TGase).
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"Sequence and characterisation of the gene encoding the sigma cross-
reacting protein 27A in Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cell wall formation.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycan biosynthesis; peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 51 family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (D13188) sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 38.
