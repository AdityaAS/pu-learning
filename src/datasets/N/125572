AC   P39671;
Phosphoglucomutase (EC 5.4.2.2) (Glucose phosphomutase) (PGM).
"A chromosomal cluster of genes encoding ADP-glucose synthetase,
glycogen synthase and phosphoglucomutase in Agrobacterium
tumefaciens.";
"Biochemical characterization of avirulent exoC mutants of
Agrobacterium tumefaciens.";
-!- FUNCTION: This enzyme participates in both the breakdown and
    synthesis of glucose. Required for the synthesis of capsular
    polysaccharide and normal lipopolysaccharide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate = alpha-D-glucose
    6-phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphohexose mutase family.
