Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F2 precursor (EC 3.2.1.96)
(Mannosyl-glycoprotein endo-beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase F2) (Di-N-
acetylchitobiosyl beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F2) (Endoglycosidase
F2).
"Multiple endoglycosidase F activities expressed by Flavobacterium
meningosepticum endoglycosidases F2 and F3. Molecular cloning, primary
sequence, and enzyme expression.";
"Novel, specific O-glycosylation of secreted Flavobacterium
meningosepticum proteins. Asp-Ser and Asp-Thr-Thr consensus sites.";
"Detailed structural analysis of a novel, specific O-linked glycan
from the prokaryote Flavobacterium meningosepticum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Endohydrolysis of the di-N-acetylchitobiosyl unit in
    high-mannose glycopeptides and glycoproteins. Complex biantennary
    glycans are the preferred substrates. Tri- and tetraantennary
    glycans are not hydrolyzed, and high mannose glycans are very poor
    substrates.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endohydrolysis of the N,N'-diacetylchitobiosyl
    unit in high-mannose glycopeptides and glycoproteins containing
    the -(Man(GlcNAc)(2))Asn-structure. One N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
    residue remains attached to the protein; the rest of the
    oligosaccharide is released intact.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- PTM: Carbohydrates at Ser-73, Ser-89 and Ser-143 consist of (2-
    OMe)Man1-4GlcNAcU1-4GlcU1-4Glc1-4(2-OMe)GlcU1-4[(2-OMe)Rham1-
    2]Man.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 18 family.
Direct protein sequencing; Glycoprotein; Glycosidase; Hydrolase;
