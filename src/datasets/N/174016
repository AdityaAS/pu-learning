-!- FUNCTION: Destroys radicals which are normally produced within the
    cells and which are toxic to biological systems.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 superoxide + 2 H(+) = O(2) + H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 manganese ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial matrix.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the iron/manganese superoxide dismutase
    family.
