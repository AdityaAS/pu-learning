Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF).
"Molecular cloning, expression and regional distribution of rat
ciliary neurotrophic factor.";
-!- FUNCTION: CNTF is a survival factor for various neuronal cell
    types. Seems to prevent the degeneration of motor axons after
    axotomy.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Nervous system.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CNTF family.
