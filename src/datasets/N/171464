project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in cellular transformation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous. Expression levels were increased
    fourfold to tenfold in lung tumor tissues compared with normal
    pulmonary tissues.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TDE1 family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (AAB48858) and Ref.3 (AAD34641) sequences differ
    from that shown due to frameshifts in positions 321, 393, 407 and
    459.
