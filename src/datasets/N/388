Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A 55 kDa regulatory subunit B
beta isoform (PP2A, subunit B, beta isoform).
"Molecular cloning and characterization of cDNA and genomic DNA
encodes the homologue of the 55 kDa B regulatory subunit of protein
phosphatase 2A in rice (Oryza sativa L.).";
"Oryza sativa nipponbare chromosome 2 genomic DNA sequence.";
"Collection, mapping, and annotation of over 28,000 cDNA clones from
japonica rice.";
-!- FUNCTION: The B regulatory subunit may modulate substrate
    selectivity and catalytic activity, and also may direct the
    localization of the catalytic enzyme to a particular subcellular
    compartment (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: PP2A consists of a common heteromeric enzyme, composed of
    a catalytic subunit (subunits C), a constant regulatory subunit
    (subunit A), and a variety of regulatory subunits such as subunits
    B (the R2/B/PR55/B55, R3/B''/PR72/PR130/PR59 and R5/B'/B56
    families) (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 WD repeats.
Repeat; WD repeat.
