HERV-K_1q22 provirus ancestral Pro protein (EC 3.4.23.-) (HERV-K102
Pro protein) (HERV-K(III) Pro protein) (Protease) (Proteinase) (PR).
"Many human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) proviruses are unique to
humans.";
"The DNA sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Retroviral proteases have roles in processing of the
    primary translation products and the maturation of the viral
    particle. Endogenous Pro proteins may have kept, lost or modified
    their original function during evolution. This endogenous protein
    has retained most of the characteristics of retroviral proteases.
-!- SUBUNIT: Active as a homodimer (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Autoproteolytically processed at the N-terminus. Expected C-
    terminal autoprocessing not detected. The sequence shown is that
    of the processed Pro protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein is synthesized as Gag-Pro and Gag-Pro-
    Pol polyprotein. These polyproteins are thought, by similarity
    with type-B retroviruses, to be generated by -1 frameshifts
    occurring at the Gag-Pro and Pro-Pol genes boundaries.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase A2 family. HERV class-II
    K(HML-2) subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 G-patch domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase A2 domain.
