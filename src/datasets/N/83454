AC   Q59S66;
Spindle assembly checkpoint kinase (EC 2.7.11.1) (Aurora kinase).
"The diploid genome sequence of Candida albicans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for high-fidelity chromosome segregation during
    the later part of each cell cycle. Acts in opposition to the
    phosphatase PP1. Has a role in attaching the kinetochores to the
    microtubules and ensuring that sister kinetochores connect to
    opposite poles. The promotion of bi-orientation is achieved by
    selectively detaching kinetochore-microtubule attachments that are
    not under tension (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity). Spindle (By
    similarity). Kinetochore (By similarity). Note=Associates with the
    mitotic spindle and on elongated and disassembling spindles. Also
    associated with the kinetochore (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. Aurora
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
