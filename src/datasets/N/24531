10 kDa chaperonin (Protein Cpn10) (groES protein).
"Molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of chaperonin-60
and chaperonin-10 from a thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus
HB8.";
"Cloning and characterization of the GroESL operon in Thermus
aquaticus HB8.";
"Complete genome sequence of Thermus thermophilus HB8.";
"A chaperonin from a thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus,
that controls refoldings of several thermophilic enzymes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to Cpn60 in the presence of Mg-ATP and suppresses
    the ATPase activity of the latter.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heptamer of 7 subunits arranged in a ring (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the groES chaperonin family.
