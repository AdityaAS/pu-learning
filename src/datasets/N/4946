AC   Q8R4S4;
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor precursor (Ah receptor) (AhR).
"Sequence variation and phylogenetic history of the mouse Ahr gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Ligand-activated transcriptional activator. Binds to the
    XRE promoter region of genes it activates. Activates the
    expression of multiple phase I and II xenobiotic chemical
    metabolizing enzyme genes (such as the CYP1A1 gene). Mediates
    biochemical and toxic effects of halogenated aromatic
    hydrocarbons. Involved in cell-cycle regulation. Likely to play an
    important role in the development and maturation of many tissues
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Efficient DNA binding requires dimerization with another
    bHLH protein. In the nucleus, heterodimer of AHR and ARNT.
    Interacts with coactivators including SRC-1, RIP140 and NOCA7, and
    with the corepressor SMRT. Interacts with MYBBP1A and NEDD8 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity). Note=First cytoplasmic, upon binding with ligand and
    interaction with a HSP90, it translocates to the nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PAC (PAS-associated C-terminal) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domains.
