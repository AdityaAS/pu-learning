AC   Q6CZY2;
50S ribosomal protein L5.
"Genome sequence of the enterobacterial phytopathogen Erwinia
carotovora subsp. atroseptica and characterization of virulence
factors.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is 1 of the proteins that binds and probably
    mediates the attachment of the 5S RNA into the large ribosomal
    subunit, where it forms part of the central protuberance. In the
    70S ribosome it contacts protein S13 of the 30S subunit (bridge
    B1b), connecting the 2 subunits; this bridge is implicated in
    subunit movement. Contacts the P site tRNA; the 5S rRNA and some
    of its associated proteins might help stabilize positioning of
    ribosome-bound tRNAs (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit; part of the 5S
    rRNA/L5/L18/L25 subcomplex. Contacts the 5S rRNA and the P site
    tRNA. Forms a bridge to the 30S subunit in the 70S ribosome (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L5P family.
