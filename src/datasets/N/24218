"The role of CDC28 and cyclins during mitosis in the budding yeast S.
cerevisiae.";
"Cyclin-B homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae function in S phase and
in G2.";

"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential for the control of the cell cycle at the G2/M
    (mitosis) transition. Interacts with the CDC2 protein kinase to
    form MPF. G2/M cyclins accumulate steadily during G2 and are
    abruptly destroyed at mitosis.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P00546:CDC28; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-4515, EBI-4253;
    P47035:NET1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-4515, EBI-25953;
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Maximally expressed before mitosis. The
    levels peak late in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and are at a
    minimum in G1 phase.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 339 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyclin family. Cyclin AB subfamily.
