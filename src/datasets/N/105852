AC   Q66CH3;
Chromosome partition protein mukB (Structural maintenance of
chromosome-related protein).
"Insights into the evolution of Yersinia pestis through whole-genome
comparison with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a central role in chromosome condensation,
    segregation and cell cycle progression. Functions as a homodimer,
    which is essential for chromosome partition. Involved in negative
    DNA supercoiling in vivo, and by this means organize and compact
    chromosomes. May achieve or facilitate chromosome segregation by
    condensation DNA from both sides of a centrally located replisome
    during cell division (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimerization via its hinge domain. Binds to DNA via
    its C-terminal region. Interacts, and probably forms a ternary
    complex, with mukE and mukF via its C-terminal region. The complex
    formation is stimulated by calcium or magnesium. Interacts with
    tubulin-related protein ftsZ (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm; nucleoid (By similarity).
    Note=Restricted to the nucleoid region (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The hinge domain, which separates the large intramolecular
    coiled coil regions, allows the homodimerization, forming a V-
    shaped homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SMC family. MukB subfamily.
