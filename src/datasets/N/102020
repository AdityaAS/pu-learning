-!- FUNCTION: Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex
    which is involved in transcriptional activation of select genes
    principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 and H2A. This
    modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and
    promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins
    which positively regulate transcription. This complex may be
    required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated
    with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor
    suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence,
    apoptosis, and DNA repair. The NuA4 complex ATPase and helicase
    activities seem to be, at least in part, contributed by the
    association of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 with EP400. NuA4 may also play a
    direct role in DNA repair when directly recruited to sites of DNA
    damage. Also component of the MSIN3A complex which acts to repress
    transcription by deacetylation of nucleosomal histones.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex
    which contains the catalytic subunit HTATIP/TIP60 and the subunits
    EP400, TRRAP/PAF400, BRD8/SMAP, EPC1, DMAP1/DNMAP1, RUVBL1/TIP49,
    RUVBL2, ING3, actin, ACTL6A/BAF53A, MORF4L1/MRG15, MORF4L2/MRGX,
    MRGBP, YEATS4/GAS41 and VPS72/YL1. The NuA4 complex interacts with
    MYC and the adenovirus E1A protein. MORF4L1 may also participate
    in the formation of NuA4 related complexes which lack the
    HTATIP/TIP60 catalytic subunit, but which include the SWI/SNF
    related protein SRCAP. Component of the MSIN3A histone deacetylase
    complex, which includes SIN3A, HDAC2, ARID4B, MORF4L1,
    RBBP4/RbAp48, and RBBP7/RbAp46. MORF4L2 interacts with RB1.
    MORF4L2 may also interact with one or more as yet undefined
    members of the TLE (transducin-like enhancer of split) family of
    transcriptional repressors.
