AC   P34161;
Homeobox protein YOX1.
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
XIII.";
"Creation of the YFLEX clone resource: cloning of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae ORFs in the Gateway recombinational cloning system.";
"In vitro binding to the leucine tRNA gene identifies a novel yeast
homeobox gene.";
"Conserved homeodomain proteins interact with MADS box protein Mcm1 to
restrict ECB-dependent transcription to the M/G1 phase of the cell
cycle.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor required to restrict
    transcription of ECB-dependent genes to the G1/M phase by
    repressing their transcription during the interval from late G1 to
    M phases. Genes that contain a ECB (early cell box) element in
    their transcription regulatory region are transcribed only during
    G1/M phases. In vitro, is capable of binding to the DNA of the
    leucine tRNA gene.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with MCM1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed from late G1 phase.
-!- INDUCTION: Transcriptionally activated by SWI4-SWI6 heterodimer.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 861 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 homeobox DNA-binding domain.
