AC   P42198;
Transcription initiation factor IIB (TFIIB) (Fragment).
"The primary structure of sensory rhodopsin II: a member of an
additional retinal protein subgroup is coexpressed with its
transducer, the halobacterial transducer of rhodopsin II.";
-!- FUNCTION: Stabilizes TBP binding to an archaeal box-A promoter.
    Also responsible for recruiting RNA polymerase II to the pre-
    initiation complex (DNA-TBP-TFIIB) (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TFIIB family.
