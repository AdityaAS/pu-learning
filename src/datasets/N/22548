AC   P56493;
C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (C-C CKR-5) (CC-CKR-5) (CCR-5) (CCR5)
(CD195 antigen).
"Polymorphisms in the CCR5 genes of African green monkeys and mice
implicate specific amino acids in infections by simian and human
immunodeficiency viruses.";
"cDNA sequence of African green monkey CCR-5 chemokine receptor
gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for a C-C type chemokine. Binds to MIP-1-alpha,
    MIP-1-beta and RANTES and subsequently transduces a signal by
    increasing the intracellular calcium ions level. May play a role
    in the control of granulocytic lineage proliferation or
    differentiation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PRAF2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
