AC   Q8SPU8;
Dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 4 (EC 1.1.1.184) (NADPH-
dependent carbonyl reductase/NADP-retinol dehydrogenase) (CR) (PHCR)
(Peroxisomal short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase) (NADPH-dependent
retinol dehydrogenase/reductase) (NDRD).
"Bos taurus NDRD mRNA for NADPH-dependent retinol
dehydrogenase/reductase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Reduces all-trans-retinal and 9-cis retinal. Can also
    catalyze the oxidation of all-trans-retinol with NADP as co-
    factor, but with much lower efficiency. Reduces alkyl phenyl
    ketones and alpha-dicarbonyl compounds with aromatic rings, such
    as pyrimidine-4-aldehyde, 3-benzoylpyridine, 4-benzoylpyridine,
    menadione and 4-hexanoylpyridine. Has no activity towards
    aliphatic aldehydes and ketones (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: R-CHOH-R' + NADP(+) = R-CO-R' + NADPH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Peroxisome (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Inhibited by kaempferol, quercetin, genistein and
    myristic acid (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases
    (SDR) family.
