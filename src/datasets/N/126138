AC   Q9QZA1;
Pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 1 (Proline- and
glutamine-rich protein) (PQR protein).
"A proline- and glutamine-rich protein promotes apoptosis in neuronal
cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to be involved in regulation of apoptosis. May be
    involved in detachment-mediated programmed cell death. May mediate
    apoptosis during neuronal development. May be involved in
    regulation of anti-apoptotic effects of IGF1. May be involved in
    translational regulation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with RPL14, EIF3S7 and PABPC4 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Cytoplasmic
    vesicle; cytoplasmic vesicle membrane. Nucleus; nucleolus (By
    similarity). Note=Colocalizes with intracellular vesicles.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expression increases during embryonal
    development at embryonic days E11, E15 and E17.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by FGF in a hippocampal progenitor cell line.
    Induced by FGF and EGF in a CNS neuronal cell line.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PH domain.
Apoptosis; Nuclear protein; Repeat.
