AC   Q9UVZ5;
Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23) (OMP decarboxylase)
(OMPDCase) (OMPdecase) (Uridine 5'-monophosphate synthase) (UMP
synthase).
"Transformation of Endomyces fibuliger based on its gene for
orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Orotidine 5'-phosphate = UMP + CO(2).
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; UMP biosynthesis; UMP from
    HCO(3)(-): step 6 [final step].
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Pyrimidine biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the OMP decarboxylase family.
Decarboxylase; Lyase; Pyrimidine biosynthesis.
