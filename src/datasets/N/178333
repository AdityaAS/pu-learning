AC   Q8TY72;
5'-nucleotidase surE (EC 3.1.3.5) (Nucleoside 5'-monophosphate
phosphohydrolase).
"The complete genome of hyperthermophile Methanopyrus kandleri AV19
and monophyly of archaeal methanogens.";
-!- FUNCTION: Nucleotidase that shows phosphatase activity on
    nucleoside 5'-monophosphates (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A 5'-ribonucleotide + H(2)O = a ribonucleoside
    + phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 divalent metal cation per subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the surE nucleotidase family.
