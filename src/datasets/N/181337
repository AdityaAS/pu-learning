"Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae
Rd.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-lysine + tRNA(Lys) = AMP + diphosphate
    + L-lysyl-tRNA(Lys).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 3 magnesium ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
