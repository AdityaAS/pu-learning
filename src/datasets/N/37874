AC   P04989;
Cysteine proteinase 2 precursor (EC 3.4.22.-) (Prestalk cathepsin).
"Identification of the sequences controlling cyclic AMP regulation and
cell-type-specific expression of a prestalk-specific gene in
Dictyostelium discoideum.";
"Characterization of two highly diverged but developmentally co-
regulated cysteine proteinase genes in Dictyostelium discoideum.";
"Cellular and subcellular distribution of a cAMP-regulated prestalk
protein and prespore protein in Dictyostelium discoideum: a study on
the ontogeny of prestalk and prespore cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cysteine proteinases 1 and 2 are believed to participate
    in the breakdown of protein during differentiation of
    Dictyostelium as a response to starvation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Lysosome.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed by prestalk cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase C1 family.
