AC   Q92400;
Exoglucanase precursor (EC 3.2.1.91) (Exocellobiohydrolase) (1,4-beta-
cellobiohydrolase) (Beta-glucancellobiohydrolase).
"Expression of CEL2 and CEL4, two proteins from Agaricus bisporus with
similarity to fungal cellobiohydrolase I and beta-mannanase,
respectively, is regulated by the carbon source.";
-!- FUNCTION: The biological conversion of cellulose to glucose
    generally requires three types of hydrolytic enzymes: (1)
    Endoglucanases which cut internal beta-1,4-glucosidic bonds; (2)
    Exocellobiohydrolases that cut the dissaccharide cellobiose from
    the nonreducing end of the cellulose polymer chain; (3) Beta-1,4-
    glucosidases which hydrolyze the cellobiose and other short cello-
    oligosaccharides to glucose.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic linkages
    in cellulose and cellotetraose, releasing cellobiose from the non-
    reducing ends of the chains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 7 (cellulase C)
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CBM1 (fungal-type carbohydrate-binding)
    domain.
