AC   Q40300;
Fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a-c binding protein F, chloroplast precursor
(Fragment).
"The gene family encoding the fucoxanthin chlorophyll proteins from
the brown alga Macrocystis pyrifera.";
-!- FUNCTION: The light-harvesting complex (LHC) functions as a light
    receptor, it captures and delivers excitation energy to
    photosystems with which it is closely associated. Energy is
    transferred from the carotenoid and chlorophyll C (or B) to
    chlorophyll A and the photosynthetic reaction centers where it is
    used to synthesize ATP and reducing power.
-!- SUBUNIT: The LHC complex of chromophytic algae is composed of
    fucoxanthin, chlorophyll A and C bound non-covalently by
    fucoxanthin chlorophyll proteins (FCPs). The ratio of pigments in
    this LHC is; fucoxanthin: chlorophyll C: chlorophyll A; (0.6-1):
    (0.1-0.3): (1).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Note=FCPs are probably
    transported across the endoplasmic reticulum membranes that
    surround the plastid via a signal peptide, followed by
    translocation across the thylakoid membrane via a transit peptide.
-!- INDUCTION: Levels are increased up to tenfold when transferred
    from high intensity to low intensity blue or white light.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fucoxanthin chlorophyll protein family.
