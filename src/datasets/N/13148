AC   Q7RZT9;
Serine/threonine-protein kinase tel-1 (EC 2.7.11.1) (DNA-damage
checkpoint kinase tel-1) (Telomere length regulation protein 1) (ATM
homolog).
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Serine/threonine protein kinase which activates
    checkpoint signaling upon genotoxic stresses such as ionizing
    radiation (IR), ultraviolet light (UV), or DNA replication
    stalling, thereby acting as a DNA damage sensor. Recognizes the
    substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-130' of
    histone H2A at sites of DNA damage, involved in the regulation of
    DNA damage response mechanism. Required for the control of
    telomere length and genome stability (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- SUBUNIT: Associates with DNA double-strand breaks (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity). Note=Localizes to
    nuclear DNA repair foci with other DNA repair proteins in response
    to DNA double strand breaks (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PI3/PI4-kinase family. ATM subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 FAT domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 FATC domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PI3K/PI4K domain.
