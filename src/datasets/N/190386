Toll-interacting protein.
"Tollip, a new component of the IL-1R1 pathway, links IRAK to the IL-1
receptor.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the signaling pathway of IL-1 and Toll-like
    receptors. Inhibits cell activation by microbial products.
    Recruits IRAK1 to the IL-1 receptor complex. Inhibits IRAK1
    phosphorylation and kinase activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Oligomerizes. Binds to TLR2 and the TLR4-MD2 complex via
    its C-terminus. Exists as complex with IRAK1 in unstimulated
    cells. Upon IL-1 signaling, Tollip binds to the activated IL-1
    receptor complex containing IL-1RI, IL-1RacP and the adapter
    protein MyD88, where it interacts with the TIR domain of IL-1RacP.
    MyD88 then triggers IRAK1 autophosphorylation, which in turn leads
    to the dissociation of IRAK1 from Tollip and IL-1RAcP (By
    similarity).
