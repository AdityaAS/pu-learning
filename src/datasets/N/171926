AC   Q28686;
Alpha-sarcoglycan precursor (Alpha-SG) (Adhalin) (50 kDa dystrophin-
associated glycoprotein) (50DAG) (Dystroglycan 2).
"Primary structure and muscle-specific expression of the 50-kDa
dystrophin-associated glycoprotein (adhalin).";
"Identification of alpha-syntrophin binding to syntrophin triplet,
dystrophin, and utrophin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the sarcoglycan complex, a subcomplex of
    the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex which forms a link between the
    F-actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.
-!- SUBUNIT: Cross-link to form 2 major subcomplexes: one consisting
    of SGCB, SGCD and SGCG and the other consisiting of SGCB and SGCD.
    The association between SGCB and SGCG is particularly strong while
    SGCA is loosely associated with the other sarcoglycans (By
    similarity). Interacts with the syntrophin SNTA1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; sarcolemma; single-pass type
    I membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sarcoglycan alpha/epsilon family.
