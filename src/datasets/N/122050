AC   P13166;
Polymerase acidic protein (RNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit P2).
"Evolutionary pathways of the PA genes of influenza A viruses.";
-!- FUNCTION: Implicated in endonuclease cleavage of capped RNA
    primers. Displays an elongation factor activity in viral RNA
    synthesis. Dispensable for viral transcription, but not
    replication.
-!- SUBUNIT: Influenza RNA polymerase is composed of three subunits:
    PB1, PB2 and PA.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on serines and threonines by host kinases,
    including human casein kinase II (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the influenza viruses PA family.
Phosphorylation.
