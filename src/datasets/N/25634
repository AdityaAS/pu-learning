Charged multivesicular body protein 1a (Chromatin-modifying protein
1a) (CHMP1a).
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"CHMP1 is a novel nuclear matrix protein affecting chromatin structure
and cell-cycle progression.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is required
    for multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of
    endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. The MVB pathway mediates
    delivery of transmembrane proteins into the lumen of the lysosome
    for degradation. The ESCRT-III complex is probably involved in the
    concentration of MVB cargo. May also be involved in chromosome
    condensation. Targets the Polycomb group (PcG) protein PCGF4/BMI1
    to regions of condensed chromatin. May play a role in stable cell
    cycle progression and in PcG gene silencing (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the endosomal sorting required for transport
    complex III (ESCRT-III), at least composed of CHMP1A, CHMP1B,
    CHMP2A, CHMP2B, CHMP3/VPS24, CHMP4A/SHAX2, CHMP4B/SHAX1,
    CHMP4C/SHAX3, CHMP5/SNF7DC2 and CHMP6/VPS20. In the complex, it
    interacts directly with CHMP1A. Interacts directly with VPS4A and
    VPS4B, the association with VPS4 proteins mediating the ATP-
    dependent disassembly of the ESCRT-III complex (By similarity).
    Interacts with PHF1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Endosome; endosomal membrane;
    peripheral membrane protein. Nucleus; nuclear matrix. Note=The
    cytoplasmic form is partially membrane-associated and localizes to
    early endosomes. The nuclear form remains associated with the
    chromosome scaffold during mitosis. On overexpression, it
    localizes to nuclear bodies characterized by nuclease-resistant
    condensed chromatin.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in adult heart, kidney and
    liver. Expressed at lower levels in adult colon, spleen, lung,
    brain, testis and muscle. Also expressed in myoblasts and embryo
    fibroblasts.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SNF7 family.
