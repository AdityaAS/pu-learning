AC   Q8XGW7; Q7AM03;
Small heat shock protein ibpA (16 kDa heat shock protein A).
"Comparative genomics of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi strains Ty2
and CT18.";
"Complete genome sequence of a multiple drug resistant Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi CT18.";
-!- FUNCTION: Associates with aggregated proteins, together with ibpB,
    to stabilize and protect them from irreversible denaturation and
    extensive proteolysis during heat shock and oxidative stress.
    Aggregated proteins bound to the ibpAB complex are more
    efficiently refolded and reactivated by the ATP-dependent
    chaperone systems clpB and dnaK/dnaJ/grpE. Its activity is ATP-
    independent (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer. Forms homomultimers of about 100-150 subunits at
    optimal growth temperatures. Conformation changes to monomers at
    high temperatures or high ionic concentrations (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small heat shock protein (HSP20)
    family.
