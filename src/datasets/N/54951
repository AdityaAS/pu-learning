AC   P0C1J6;
FK506-binding protein 4 (EC 5.2.1.8) (Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
isomerase) (PPIase) (Rotamase).
"The genome sequence of Rhizopus oryzae RA 99-880.";
-!- FUNCTION: PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes
    the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in
    oligopeptides (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Peptidylproline (omega=180) = peptidylproline
    (omega=0).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by both FK506 and rapamycin (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nucleolus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FKBP-type PPIase family. FKBP3/4
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PPIase FKBP-type domain.
Isomerase; Nuclear protein; Rotamase.
