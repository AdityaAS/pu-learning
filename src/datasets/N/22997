AC   Q4G059;
Cell division cycle-associated 7-like protein.
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Play a role in transcriptional regulation as a repressor
    that inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) activity and gene
    expression by binding to the promoter. Play an important oncogenic
    role in mediating the full transforming effect of MYC in
    medulloblastoma cells. Involved in apoptotic signaling pathways;
    May act downstream of P38-kinase and BCL-2, but upstream of
    CASP3/caspase-3 as well as CCND1/cyclin D1 and E2F1 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with MYC and PSIP1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity). Note=Associates with chromatin. Translocates from
    cytoplasm to nucleus under dexamethasone induction (By
    similarity).
