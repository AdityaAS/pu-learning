-!- FUNCTION: This protein is a "fusion" protein encoding four
    enzymatic activities of the pyrimidine pathway (GATase, CPSase,
    ATCase and DHOase).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 ATP + L-glutamine + HCO(3)(-) + H(2)O = 2
    ADP + phosphate + L-glutamate + carbamoyl phosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Carbamoyl phosphate + L-aspartate = phosphate
    + N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (S)-dihydroorotate + H(2)O = N-carbamoyl-L-
    aspartate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (for dihydroorotase
    activity) (Potential).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 manganese ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; UMP biosynthesis; UMP from
    HCO(3)(-): step 1.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; UMP biosynthesis; UMP from
    HCO(3)(-): step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; UMP biosynthesis; UMP from
    HCO(3)(-): step 3.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Pyrimidine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=A;
      IsoId=P05990-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=B;
      IsoId=P05990-2; Sequence=VSP_016004, VSP_016005;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: GATase (glutamine amidotransferase) and CPSase
    (carbamoyl phosphate synthase) together form the glutamine-
    dependent CPSase (GD-CPSase) (EC 6.3.5.5).
-!- SIMILARITY: In the central section; belongs to the DHOase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ATP-grasp domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 glutamine amidotransferase type-1 domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 and Ref.2 sequences differ from that shown due to
    various problems, including DNA not present in the genome.
