synthetase) (P-450AROM).
"Characterization of a cetacean aromatase (CYP19) and the phylogeny
and functional conservation of vertebrate aromatase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of aromatic C18 estrogens from
    C19 androgens.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: RH + reduced flavoprotein + O(2) = ROH +
    oxidized flavoprotein + H(2)O.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; peripheral membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family.
