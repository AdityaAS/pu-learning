Lysophospholipase 1 precursor (EC 3.1.1.5) (Phospholipase B 1).
"Cloning and characterization of phospholipase gene (PLB1) of Candida
glabrata.";
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the release of fatty acids from
    lysophospholipids. Phospholipase B may well contribute to
    pathogenicity by abetting the fungus in damaging and traversing
    host cell membranes, processes which likely increase the rapidity
    of disseminated infection (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-lysophosphatidylcholine + H(2)O =
    glycerophosphocholine + a carboxylate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lysophospholipase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PLA2c domain.
