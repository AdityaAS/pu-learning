Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain precursor (EC 4.1.1.39)
(RuBisCO large subunit) (Fragment).
"Comparison of the evolution of ribulose-1, 5-biphosphate carboxylase
(rbcL) and atpB-rbcL noncoding spacer sequences in a recent plant
group, the tribe Rubieae (Rubiaceae).";
-!- FUNCTION: RuBisCO catalyzes two reactions: the carboxylation of D-
    ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, the primary event in carbon dioxide
    fixation, as well as the oxidative fragmentation of the pentose
    substrate in the photorespiration process. Both reactions occur
    simultaneously and in competition at the same active site (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate + CO(2) + H(2)O =
    2 3-phospho-D-glycerate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate + O(2) = 3-
    phospho-D-glycerate + 2-phosphoglycolate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterohexadecamer of 8 large chains and 8 small chains;
    disulfide-linked. The disulfide link is formed within the large
    subunit homodimers (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- PTM: The disulfide bond which can form in the large chain dimeric
    partners within the hexadecamer appears to be associated with
    oxidative stress and protein turnover (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The basic functional RuBisCO is composed of a large
    chain homodimer in a "head-to-tail" conformation. In form I
    RuBisCO this homodimer is arranged in a barrel-like tetramer with
    the small subunits forming a tetrameric "cap" on each end of the
    "barrel" (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RuBisCO large chain family. Type I
    subfamily.
