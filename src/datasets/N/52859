-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of an hydroxyacyl-CoA by
    addition of water on enoyl-CoA. Also exhibits 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
    epimerase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities. Involved
    in the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of long-chain fatty acids
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA + NAD(+) = 3-oxoacyl-CoA
    + NADH.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (3S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA = trans-2(or 3)-enoyl-
    CoA + H(2)O.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA = (R)-3-
    hydroxybutanoyl-CoA.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (3Z)-dodec-3-enoyl-CoA = (2E)-dodec-2-enoyl-
    CoA.
-!- PATHWAY: Lipid catabolism; beta-oxidation cycle; from acyl-CoA:
    step B.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer of two alpha chains (fadB) and two beta
    chains (fadA) (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the enoyl-CoA
    hydratase/isomerase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the 3-
    hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase family.
