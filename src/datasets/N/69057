Endoglucanase C precursor (EC 3.2.1.4) (Endo-1,4-beta-glucanase C)
(Cellulase C).
"Nucleotide sequence of the endoglucanase C gene (cenC) of
Cellulomonas fimi, its high-level expression in Escherichia coli, and
characterization of its products.";
"Purification and characterization of endoglucanase C of Cellulomonas
fimi, cloning of the gene, and analysis of in vivo transcripts of the
gene.";
"The binding of Cellulomonas fimi endoglucanase C (CenC) to cellulose
and Sephadex is mediated by the N-terminal repeats.";
"Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily in bacteria.";
"Structure of the N-terminal cellulose-binding domain of Cellulomonas
fimi CenC determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.";
-!- FUNCTION: The biological conversion of cellulose to glucose
    generally requires three types of hydrolytic enzymes: (1)
    Endoglucanases which cut internal beta-1,4-glucosidic bonds; (2)
    Exocellobiohydrolases that cut the dissaccharide cellobiose from
    the nonreducing end of the cellulose polymer chain; (3) Beta-1,4-
    glucosidases which hydrolyze the cellobiose and other short cello-
    oligosaccharides to glucose.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic
    linkages in cellulose, lichenin and cereal beta-D-glucans.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 9 (cellulase E)
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 CBM-cenC (cenC-type cellulose-binding)
    domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 Ig-like (immunoglobulin-like) domains.
