AC   P80232;
Cuticle protein 70, isoforms A and B (LM-70A/LM-70B).
"Combined plasma-desorption mass spectrometry and Edman degradation
applied to simultaneous sequence determination of isoforms of
structural proteins from the cuticle of Locusta migratoria.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the cuticle of migratory locust which
    contains more than 100 different structural proteins.
-!- DOMAIN: The tetrapeptide (A-A-P-[AV]) repeats found throughout the
    protein are also present in many proteins constituting the
    protective envelope of other species.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The sequence shown here is that of isoform LM-70A.
