-!- FUNCTION: Cytoplasmic anchor protein in p53-associated protein
    complex. Regulates the subcellular localization of p53 and
    subsequent function.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a complex with p53 in the cytoplasm of unstressed
    cells. Interacts with UBCH7 and UBCH8.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitously expressed in all tissues with
    highest expression in testis brain and kidney.
-!- DOMAIN: The IBR domain is required for interaction with UBCH7 and
    UBCH8.
-!- PTM: In vitro, self-ubiquitination in the presence of E1, E2 and
    ubiquitin.
