-!- FUNCTION: Carries out a dual function: signal transduction and
    activation of transcription. Involved in IL12 signaling.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a homodimer or a heterodimer with a related family
    member (By similarity). The SH2 domain interacts, in vitro, with
    IL12RB2 via a short cytoplasmic domain.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Note=Translocated into
    the nucleus in response to phosphorylation.
-!- PTM: Tyrosine phosphorylated. Serine phosphorylation is also
    required for maximal transcriptional activity (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transcription factor STAT family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SH2 domain.
