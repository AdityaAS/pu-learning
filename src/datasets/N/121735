Bifunctional 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthetase 2 (PAPS
synthetase 2) (PAPSS 2) (Sulfurylase kinase 2) (SK2) (SK 2) [Includes:
Sulfate adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.4) (Sulfate adenylate
transferase) (SAT) (ATP-sulfurylase); Adenylyl-sulfate kinase
(EC 2.7.1.25) (Adenylylsulfate 3'-phosphotransferase) (APS kinase)
(Adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate 3'-phosphotransferase) (3'-
phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate synthetase)].
"A member of a new family of sulfate activating enzymes causes murine
brachymorphism.";
"Mutations in orthologous genes in human spondyloepimetaphyseal
dysplasia and the brachymorphic mouse.";
-!- FUNCTION: Bifunctional enzyme with both ATP sulfurylase and APS
    kinase activity, which mediates two steps in the sulfate
    activation pathway. The first step is the transfer of a sulfate
    group to ATP to yield adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS), and the
    second step is the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to APS
    yielding 3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate (PAPS: activated sulfate donor
    used by sulfotransferase). In mammals, PAPS is the sole source of
    sulfate; APS appears to be only an intermediate in the sulfate-
    activation pathway. May have a important role in skeletogenesis
    during postnatal growth.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + sulfate = diphosphate + adenylyl
    sulfate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + adenylyl sulfate = ADP + 3'-
    phosphoadenylyl sulfate.
-!- PATHWAY: Sulfur metabolism; sulfate assimilation.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in liver, cartilage, skin and brain.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in Papss2 are the cause of brachymorphism (bm), a
    autosomal recessive disease, which is characterized by abnormal
    hepatic detoxification, bleeding times and postnatal growth, such
    as dome-shaped skull, short thick tail, and shortened but not
    widened limbs. The abnormal postnatal growth has been attributed
    to undersulfation of cartilage proteoglycans.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the APS kinase
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the sulfate
    adenylyltransferase family.
