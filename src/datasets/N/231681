Zinc finger protein 271 (Zinc finger protein 35) (Zfp-35).
"A mouse zinc finger gene which is transiently expressed during
spermatogenesis.";
"Genomic analysis of a mouse zinc finger gene, Zfp-35, that is up-
regulated during spermatogenesis.";
-!- FUNCTION: May act to control gene activity during the pachytene
    stage of meiotic prophase. May function as a transcription
    activator.
