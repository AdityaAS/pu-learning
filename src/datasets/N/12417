Arginyl-tRNA--protein transferase 1 (EC 2.3.2.8) (R-transferase 1)
(Arginyltransferase 1) (Arginine-tRNA--protein transferase 1).
"Alternative splicing results in differential expression, activity,
and localization of the two forms of arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase,
a component of the N-end rule pathway.";
"Structural analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 5. I. Sequence
features of the 1.6 Mb regions covered by twenty physically assigned
P1 clones.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the posttranslational conjugation of
    arginine to the N-terminal aspartate or glutamate of a protein.
    This arginylation is required for degradation of the protein via
    the ubiquitin pathway. Does not arginylate cysteine residues (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-arginyl-tRNA + protein = tRNA + L-arginyl-
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the R-transferase family.
Acyltransferase; Transferase; Ubl conjugation pathway.
