AC   P62598;
Two-component response regulator ARR12.
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 2 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"A new set of Arabidopsis expressed sequence tags from developing
seeds. The metabolic pathway from carbohydrates to seed oil.";
"Type-B response regulators display overlapping expression patterns in
Arabidopsis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator that binds specifically to the
    DNA sequence 5'-[AG]GATT-3'. Functions as a response regulator
    involved in His-to-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction system.
    Phosphorylation of the Asp residue in the receiver domain
    activates the ability of the protein to promote the transcription
    of target genes. Could directly activate some type-A response
    regulators in response to cytokinins (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds the target DNA as a monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Detected in the whole plant. Predominantly
    expressed in leaves.
-!- PTM: Two-component system major event consists of a His-to-Asp
    phosphorelay between a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and a response
    regulator (RR). In plants, the His-to-Asp phosphorelay involves an
    additionnal intermediate named Histidine-containing
    phosphotransfer protein (HPt). This multistep phosphorelay
    consists of a His-Asp-His-Asp sequential transfer of a phosphate
    group between first an His and an Asp of the HK protein, followed
    by the transfer to a conserved His of the HPt protein and finally
    the transfer to an Asp in the receiver domain of the RR protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ARR family. Type-B subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Myb-like GARP DNA-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 response regulatory domain.
