AC   Q5FVQ5;
Lymphocyte transmembrane adapter 1 (Membrane-associated adapter
protein LAX).
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Negatively regulates TCR (T-cell antigen receptor)-
    mediated signaling in T-cells and BCR (B-cell antigen receptor)-
    mediated signaling in B-cells (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: When phosphorylated, interacts with GRB2, PIK3R1 and
    GRAP2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass type III membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on tyrosines upon TCR or BCR activation; which
    leads to the recruitment of GRB2, PIK3R1 and GRAP2 (By
    similarity).
