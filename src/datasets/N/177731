AC   P36011;
Cell pattern formation-associated protein stuA.
"StuA is required for cell pattern formation in Aspergillus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the orderly differentiation and spatial
    organization of cell types of the conidiophore. Affects the
    spatial localization of abaA and brlA. Expression of stuA is
    dependent on a functional brlA protein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Potential).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expression is increased 50-fold during the
    establishment of developmental competence.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the EFG1/PHD1/stuA family.
DNA-binding; Nuclear protein; Transcription; Transcription regulation.
