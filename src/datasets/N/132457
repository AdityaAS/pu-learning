AC   Q8CXK4;
Foldase protein prsA precursor (EC 5.2.1.8).
"Genome sequence of Oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from the Iheya
Ridge and its unexpected adaptive capabilities to extreme
environments.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a major role in protein secretion by helping the
    post-translocational extracellular folding of several secreted
    proteins (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Peptidylproline (omega=180) = peptidylproline
    (omega=0).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prsA family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PpiC domain.
