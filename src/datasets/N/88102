AC   P04047;
Thymidine kinase, cytosolic (EC 2.7.1.21).
"The nucleotide sequence of the chicken thymidine kinase gene and the
relationship of its predicted polypeptide to that of the vaccinia
virus thymidine kinase.";
"Genetic and physical analysis of the chicken tk gene.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + thymidine = ADP + thymidine 5'-
    phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Two forms have been identified in animal cells, one
    in cytosol and one in mitochondria. Activity of the cytosolic
    enzyme is high in proliferating cells and peaks during the S-phase
    of the cell cycle; it is very low in resting cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the thymidine kinase family.
ATP-binding; DNA synthesis; Kinase; Nucleotide-binding; Transferase.
