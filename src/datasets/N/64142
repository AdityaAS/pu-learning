AC   P0A9C1; P13032; P78238;
Anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase subunit A (EC 1.1.99.5)
(G-3-P dehydrogenase).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Conversion of glycerol 3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone.
    Uses fumarate or nitrate as electron acceptor (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: sn-glycerol 3-phosphate + acceptor = glycerone
    phosphate + reduced acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: FMN (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Lipid metabolism; glycerophospholid metabolism.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of a catalytic glpA/B dimer and of membrane
    bound glpC (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity). Note=Loosely bound to the cytoplasmic
    membrane often occurring in vesicles associated with fumarate
    reductase (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate
    dehydrogenase family.
Complete proteome; FAD; Flavoprotein; Oxidoreductase.
