S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proenzyme 2 (EC 4.1.1.50) (AdoMetDC
2) (SamDC 2) [Contains: S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 2 beta
chain; S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 2 alpha chain].
"Complete genome sequence of the alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus
halodurans and genomic sequence comparison with Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine provides the
    aminopropyl moiety required for spermidine biosynthesis from
    putrescine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine = (5-deoxy-5-
    adenosyl)(3-aminopropyl)-methylsulfonium salt + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Pyruvoyl group (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic AdoMetDC family. Type 1
    subfamily.
