AC   Q10568;
Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 2 (Cleavage
and polyadenylation specificity factor 100 kDa subunit) (CPSF 100 kDa
subunit).
"Characterization of cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor
and cloning of its 100-kilodalton subunit.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the cleavage and polyadenylation
    specificity factor (CPSF) complex that play a key role in pre-mRNA
    3'-end formation, recognizing the AAUAAA signal sequence and
    interacting with poly(A) polymerase and other factors to bring
    about cleavage and poly(A) addition (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity
    factor (CPSF) complex, composed of CPSF1, CPSF2, CPSF3, CPSF4 and
    FIP1L1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA-metabolizing metallo-beta-
    lactamase-like family. CPSF2/YSH1 subfamily.
Direct protein sequencing; mRNA processing; Nuclear protein;
