14-3-3 protein zeta.
"Sequence and expression analysis of a Xenopus laevis cDNA which
encodes a homologue of mammalian 14-3-3 zeta protein.";
"14-3-3 proteins act as negative regulators of the mitotic inducer
Cdc25 in Xenopus egg extracts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large
    spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathway. Binds
    to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a
    phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results
    in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Present in all adult tissues examined with the
    highest levels in the brain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 14-3-3 family.
Acetylation.
