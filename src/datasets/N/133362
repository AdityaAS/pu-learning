-!- FUNCTION: The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex
    which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg,
    Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or
    slightly basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic
    activity. This subunit is involved in antigen processing to
    generate class I binding peptides.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cleavage of peptide bonds with very broad
    specificity.
-!- SUBUNIT: The proteasome is composed of at least 15 non identical
    subunits which form a highly ordered ring-shaped structure. This
    subunit is part of the immunoproteasome where it displaces the
    equivalent houskeeping subunit PSMB6.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed at high levels in the thymus,
    spleen, lung, heart and liver. Expressed at moderate levels in the
    kidney.
-!- INDUCTION: By interferon gamma.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase T1B family.
