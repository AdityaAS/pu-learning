AC   O50319;
Heat-stable enterotoxin C precursor (Y-STC).
"Nucleotide sequence of a gene encoding the novel Yersinia
enterocolitica heat-stable enterotoxin that includes a pro-region-like
sequence in its mature toxin molecule.";
"Characterization of a highly toxic, large molecular size heat-stable
enterotoxin produced by a clinical isolate of Yersinia
enterocolitica.";
-!- FUNCTION: Toxin which activates the particulate form of guanylate
    cyclase and increases cyclic GMP levels within the host intestinal
    epithelial cells. Highly toxic.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the heat-stable enterotoxin family.
