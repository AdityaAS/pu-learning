and characterization of proteins.";

"Metal-specific synthesis of two metallothioneins and gamma-glutamyl
peptides in Candida glabrata.";
-!- FUNCTION: The metallothioneins are involved in the cellular
    sequestration of toxic metal ions.
-!- INDUCTION: Both MT-I and MT-II genes are regulated by copper ion
    in a concentration-dependent fashion, and both are inducible by
    silver but not by cadmium salts.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: MT-I might bind approximately 11-12 mol eq of
    Cu(+).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the metallothionein superfamily. Type 9
    family.
