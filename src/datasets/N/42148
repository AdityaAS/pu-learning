Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4) (E3 component of pyruvate
complex) (Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) (Membrane-bound ribosome
protein complex 50 kDa subunit).
"Whole genome sequencing of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.";
"Correlation of proteomic and transcriptomic profiles of
Staphylococcus aureus during the post-exponential phase of growth.";
-!- FUNCTION: Lipoamide dehydrogenase is a component of the alpha-
    ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein 6-N-(dihydrolipoyl)lysine + NAD(+) =
    protein 6-N-(lipoyl)lysine + NADH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential). Membrane; peripheral
    membrane protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The active site is a redox-active disulfide bond.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I pyridine nucleotide-disulfide
    oxidoreductase family.
