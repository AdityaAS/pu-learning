AC   Q6NI36;
4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (EC 1.17.1.2).
"The complete genome sequence and analysis of Corynebacterium
diphtheriae NCTC13129.";
-!- FUNCTION: Converts 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate
    into isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate
    (DMAPP) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Isopentenyl diphosphate + NAD(P)(+) + H(2)O =
    (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate + NAD(P)H.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 3Fe-4S cluster (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; dimethylallyl-PP biosynthesis;
    dimethylallyl-PP from 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate:
    single step [final step].
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; isopentenyl-PP biosynthesis via
    DXP pathway; isopentenyl-PP from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:
    step 6 [final step].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ispH family.
