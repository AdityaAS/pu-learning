Bifunctional DNA-directed RNA polymerase, beta and beta' chain
(EC 2.7.7.6) [Includes: DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta chain
(Transcriptase beta chain) (RNA polymerase subunit beta); DNA-directed
RNA polymerase beta' chain (Transcriptase beta' chain) (RNA polymerase
beta' subunit)].
"The complete genome sequence of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter
pylori.";
"The largest subunits of RNA polymerase from gastric helicobacters are
tethered.";
"Helicobacter pylori with separate beta- and beta'-subunits of RNA
polymerase is viable and can colonize conventional mice.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription
    of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as
    substrates.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: The RNAP catalytic core consists of 2 alpha, 1 beta/beta'
    and 1 omega subunit. When a sigma factor is associated with the
    core the holoenzyme is formed, which can initiate transcription
    (By similarity).
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Fusion of rpoB and rpoC occurs naturally in
    Helicobacter species and at least some Wolbachia; the protein has
    been artificially split in two in H.pylori. The split protein
    seems to function normally.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the RNA
    polymerase beta chain family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the RNA
    polymerase beta' chain family.
