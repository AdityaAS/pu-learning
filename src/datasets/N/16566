AC   Q62896;
BET1 homolog (Golgi vesicular membrane-trafficking protein p18)
(rBET1).
"Mammalian vesicle trafficking proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum
and Golgi apparatus.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The mammalian protein (rbet1) homologous to yeast Bet1p is primarily
associated with the pre-Golgi intermediate compartment and is involved
in vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi
apparatus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for vesicular transport from the ER to the
    Golgi complex. Functions as a SNARE involved in the docking
    process of ER-derived vesicles with the cis-Golgi membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane;
    single-pass type IV membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the BET1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 t-SNARE coiled-coil homology domain.
