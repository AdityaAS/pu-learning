AC   Q34940;
Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S12.
"Sequences of six genes and several open reading frames in the
kinetoplast maxicircle DNA of Leishmania tarentolae.";
"An intergenic G-rich region in Leishmania tarentolae kinetoplast
maxicircle DNA is a pan-edited cryptogene encoding ribosomal protein
S12.";
-!- FUNCTION: Protein S12 is involved in the translation initiation
    step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion.
-!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=Not_applicable; Note=In the
    completely edited RNA, 117 uridines are added at 49 sites and 32
    uridines are deleted at 13 sites.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S12P family.
