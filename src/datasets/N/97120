(PMI) (Phosphohexomutase).
"Identification and characterization of the Cryptococcus neoformans
phosphomannose isomerase-encoding gene, MAN1, and its impact on
pathogenicity.";
"The genome of the basidiomycetous yeast and human pathogen
Cryptococcus neoformans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the synthesis of the GDP-mannose and
    dolichol-phosphate-mannose required for a number of critical
    mannosyl transfer reactions (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-mannose 6-phosphate = D-fructose 6-
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Glycosylation; early steps of mannosylation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase type 1
    family.
