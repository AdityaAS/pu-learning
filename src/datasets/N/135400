Phosphate acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.8) (Phosphotransacetylase).
"Whole genome sequencing of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.";
"Correlation of proteomic and transcriptomic profiles of
Staphylococcus aureus during the post-exponential phase of growth.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + phosphate = CoA + acetyl
    phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; acetyl-CoA
    biosynthesis; acetyl-CoA from acetate: step 2 [final step].
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphate acetyltransferase and
    butyryltransferase family.
