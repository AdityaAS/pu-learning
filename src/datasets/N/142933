AC   Q8EKT0;
DNA replication and repair protein recF.
"Genome sequence of the dissimilatory metal ion-reducing bacterium
Shewanella oneidensis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The recF protein is involved in DNA metabolism; it is
    required for DNA replication and normal SOS inducibility. RecF
    binds preferentially to single-stranded, linear DNA. It also seems
    to bind ATP (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the recF family.
