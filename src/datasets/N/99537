AC   Q10664;
Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase mek-2
(EC 2.7.12.2) (MAP kinase kinase mek-2).
"MEK-2, a Caenorhabditis elegans MAP kinase kinase, functions in Ras-
mediated vulval induction and other developmental events.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Functions in the let-60 Ras signaling pathway; acts
    downstream of lin-45 raf kinase, but before the sur-1/mpK-1 gene
    product in controlling vulval cell differentiation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by tyrosine and threonine
    phosphorylation catalyzed by MAP kinase kinase kinases.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. MAP
    kinase kinase subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Developmental protein; Kinase;
