AC   Q8FK82;
Acetyl esterase (EC 3.1.1.-).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Displays esterase activity towards short chain fatty
    esters (acyl chain length of up to 8 carbons). Able to hydrolyze
    triacetylglycerol (triacetin) and tributyrylglycerol (tributyrin),
    but not trioleylglycerol (triolein) or cholesterol oleate.
    Negatively regulates malT activity by antagonizing maltotriose
    binding. Inhibits melA galactosidase activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Interacts with malT and melA (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the "GDXG" lipolytic enzyme family.
