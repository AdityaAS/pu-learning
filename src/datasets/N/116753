AC   O08587;
Nucleoporin 50 kDa (Nuclear pore-associated protein 60 kDa-like).
"cDNA cloning and characterization of Npap60: a novel rat nuclear
pore-associated protein with an unusual subcellular localization
during male germ cell differentiation.";
"Nup50, a nucleoplasmically oriented nucleoporin with a role in
nuclear protein export.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the nuclear pore complex that has a direct
    role in nuclear protein export. May serve as a binding site on the
    nuclear side of the pore complex for export receptor-cargo
    complexes. Interacts with multiple transport receptor proteins
    including p27Kip1. This interaction is required for correct
    intracellular transport and degradation of p27Kip1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with Importin alpha-2, Importin beta, Importin
    beta-2, NUP153, Ran binding protein 7, p27Kip1 and itself.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nuclear pore complex; nucleoplasmic
    side. Note=Localizes to the nucleoplasmic fibrils of the nuclear
    pore complex. In the testis, the localization changes during germ
    cell differentiation. From the nuclear surface in spermatocytes to
    the whole nucleus (interior) in spermatids and back to the nuclear
    surface in spermatozoa.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in testis, intermediate
    levels in kidney, liver, spleen and low basal levels in somatic
    cells. Expression in testis undergoes changes and subcellular
    localization during germ cell differentiation.
-!- DOMAIN: Contains FG repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RanBD1 domain.
