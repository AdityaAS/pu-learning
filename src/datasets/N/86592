NF-kappa-B inhibitor-interacting Ras-like protein (Kappa B-Ras)
(KappaB-Ras).
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Atypical Ras-like protein that may act as a regulator of
    NF-kappa-B activity (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: In contrast to other members of the Ras family, the
    members of the KappaB-Ras subfamily do not contain the conserved
    Gly and Gln residues in positions 13 and 65, which are replaced by
    Lys and Val residues, respectively, and are therefore similar to
    the constitutively active forms of oncogenic forms of Ras. This
    suggests that members of this family are clearly different from
    other small GTPases proteins.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small GTPase superfamily. Ras family.
    KappaB-Ras subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Miro domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
Complete proteome; GTP-binding; Nucleotide-binding.
