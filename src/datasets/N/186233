AC   Q5PC07;
L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103).
"Comparison of genome degradation in Paratyphi A and Typhi, human-
restricted serovars of Salmonella enterica that cause typhoid.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-threonine + NAD(+) = L-2-amino-3-
    oxobutanoate + NADH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 zinc ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Threonine catabolism; first step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenase
    family.
