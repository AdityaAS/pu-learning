AC   P27989;
Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl CoA synthase subunit beta
(EC 1.2.7.4) (EC 1.2.99.2) (Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase subunit)
(CODH/ACS) (CODH subunit).
"The primary structure of the subunits of carbon monoxide
dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase from Clostridium thermoaceticum.";
"A Ni-Fe-Cu center in a bifunctional carbon monoxide
dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase.";
"Ni-Zn-[Fe4-S4] and Ni-Ni-[Fe4-S4] clusters in closed and open
subunits of acetyl-CoA synthase/carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.";
-!- FUNCTION: The beta subunit (this protein) generates CO from CO(2),
    while the alpha subunit combines the CO with CoA and a methyl
    group to form acetyl-CoA. The methyl group, which is incorporated
    into acetyl-CoA, is transferred to the alpha subunit by a
    corrinoid iron-sulfur protein.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CO + H(2)O + oxidized ferredoxin = CO(2) +
    reduced ferredoxin.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CO + H(2)O + A = CO(2) + AH(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 nickel-iron-sulfur cluster per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 4Fe-4S clusters per homodimer.
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta chains.
