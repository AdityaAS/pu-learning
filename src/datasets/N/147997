-!- FUNCTION: This protein binds directly to 23S ribosomal RNA and is
    located at the A site of the peptidyltransferase center. It
    contacts the A and P site tRNAs. It has an essential role in
    subunit assembly, which is not well understood.
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit. Cross-links to the A
    and P site tRNAs.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=15326.2; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=1-136;
    NOTE=Ref.8.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L16P family.
