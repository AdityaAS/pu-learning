Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase (EC 2.5.1.31) (UPP synthetase)
(Di-trans,poly-cis-decaprenylcistransferase) (Undecaprenyl diphosphate
synthase) (UDS).
"Comparative genomics of Listeria species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Generates undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UPP) from
    isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). UPP is the precursor of glycosyl
    carrier lipid in the biosynthesis of bacterial cell wall
    polysaccharide components such as peptidoglycan and
    lipopolysaccharide (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Di-trans,poly-cis-decaprenyl diphosphate +
    isopentenyl diphosphate = diphosphate + di-trans,poly-cis-
    undecaprenyl diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UPP synthetase family.
