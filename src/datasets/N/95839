AC   Q5XAN3;
S-ribosylhomocysteine lyase (EC 4.4.1.21) (Autoinducer-2 production
protein luxS) (AI-2 synthesis protein).
"Progress toward characterization of the group A Streptococcus
metagenome: complete genome sequence of a macrolide-resistant serotype
M6 strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the synthesis of autoinducer 2 (AI-2) which
    is secreted by bacteria and is used to communicate both the cell
    density and the metabolic potential of the environment. The
    regulation of gene expression in response to changes in cell
    density is called quorum sensing. Catalyzes the transformation of
    S-ribosylhomocysteine (RHC) to homocysteine (HC) and 4,5-
    dihydroxy-2,3-pentadione (DPD) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-(5-deoxy-D-ribos-5-yl)-L-homocysteine = L-
    homocysteine + (S)-4,5-dihydroxypentan-2,3-dione.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 iron ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the luxS family.
