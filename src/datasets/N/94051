ERGIC-53 protein precursor (ER-Golgi intermediate compartment 53 kDa
protein) (Lectin, mannose-binding 1) (Gp58) (Intracellular mannose-

-!- FUNCTION: Mannose-specific lectin. May recognize sugar residues of
    glycoproteins, glycolipids, or glycosylphosphatidyl inositol
    anchors and may be involved in the sorting or recycling of
    proteins, lipids, or both. The LMAN1-MCFD2 complex forms a
    specific cargo receptor for the ER-to-Golgi transport of selected
    proteins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms disulfide-linked dimers and hexamers. Interacts
    with MCFD2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate
    compartment; endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment
    membrane; single-pass type I membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous.
-!- PTM: The N-terminal may be partly blocked.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=54222.91; METHOD=MALDI; RANGE=31-510;
    NOTE=Ref.6.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in LMAN1 are a cause of factor V and factor VIII
    combined deficiency (F5F8D) [MIM:227300]; also known as multiple
    coagulation factor deficiency I (MCFD1). F5F8D is an autosomal
    recessive bleeding disorder characterized by coordinate reduction
    of both clotting proteins. Affected patients present with a
    moderate bleeding tendency and have factor V and factor VIII
    levels in the range of 5-30% of normal.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 leguminous lectin-like domain.
