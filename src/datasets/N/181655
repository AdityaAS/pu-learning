AC   Q815U6;
Methionyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (EC 6.1.1.10) (Methionine--tRNA ligase 2)
(MetRS 2).
"Genome sequence of Bacillus cereus and comparative analysis with
Bacillus anthracis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Is required not only for elongation of protein synthesis
    but also for the initiation of all mRNA translation through
    initiator tRNA(fMet) aminoacylation (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-methionine + tRNA(Met) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-methionyl-tRNA(Met).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family. MetG type 1 subfamily.
