AC   P82810;
Morphine 6-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.218) (Fragments).
"Purification, characterization and partial primary structure of
morphine 6-dehydrogenase from rabbit liver cytosol.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the dehydrogenation of morphine to morphinone.
    Uses both NAD and NADP, but the activity is much greater with NAD
    than with NADP.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Morphine + NAD(P)(+) = morphinone + NAD(P)H.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Strongly inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents and
    quercetin, but not by pyrazole, barbital and indomethacine.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 9.4 with NAD as the cofactor;
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- PTM: The N-terminus is blocked.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aldo/keto reductase family.
