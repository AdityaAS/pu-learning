(strain Fushimi).";
-!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=318; Note=Partially edited. RNA
    editing at this position consists of an insertion of one or two
    guanine nucleotides. The sequence displayed here is the W protein,
    derived from the +2G edited RNA. The unedited RNA gives rise to
    the P protein (AC P14252), the +1G edited RNA gives rise to the V
    protein (AC P69284).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The P/V/C gene has two overlapping open reading
    frames. One encodes the P/V/W proteins and the other the C/Y
    proteins.
