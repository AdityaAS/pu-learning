AC   Q8ER03;
UPF0122 protein OB1530.
"Genome sequence of Oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from the Iheya
Ridge and its unexpected adaptive capabilities to extreme
environments.";
-!- FUNCTION: Not known. Could take part in the signal recognition
    particle (SRP) pathway. This is inferred due to the conservation
    of its genetic proximity to ftsY/ffh. May be a regulatory protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UPF0122 family.
 GO:0003674; F:molecular_function; IEA:HAMAP.
