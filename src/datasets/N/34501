Cuticlin-1 precursor.
"cut-1 a Caenorhabditis elegans gene coding for a dauer-specific
noncollagenous component of the cuticle.";
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the cuticles. It forms a ribbon
    approximately 2 microns wide running along the lateral lines
    underneath the alae. Contributes to the formation of extracellular
    envelopes protecting the organism from the environment.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Localized in a narrow band not exposed to the
    exterior, running underneath the alae.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed during dauer larva formation.
-!- DOMAIN: The small repeats A-A-P-[AVI] are also present in many
    proteins constituting the protective envelope of other species.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ZP domain.
