zebrafish indicates their diversification during vertebrate
evolution.";

-!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Cytoplasm.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed zygotically. First detected at the
    30% epiboly stage. At the shield stage, expressed uniformly in the
    future ectoderm. At the 75-80% epiboly stage, becomes localized to
    the presumptive neuroectoderm; strong expression in the
    presumptive forebrain, weak expression in the presumptive spinal
    cord. At the tail bud to 3-somite stage, expressed in distinct
    regions of the future brain, the anterior margin of the neural
    plate and the future retina. At the 12-somite stage, strong
    expression in the central nervous system rostral to the hindbrain,
    including the optic vesicle. At the 21- to 25-somite stage, strong
    expression in the retina, otic placode and cerebellum. At 28-50
    hours post-fertilization, restricted to the ventricular zone of
    the hindbrain. At 5 days, expressed in the esophageal endoderm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HMG box DNA-binding domain.
