AC   Q9UIJ5;
Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC2 (EC 2.3.1.-) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-
containing protein 2) (DHHC-2) (Zinc finger protein 372) (Reduced
expression associated with metastasis protein) (Ream) (Reduced
expression in cancer protein) (Rec).
"Isolation of a novel gene on 8p21.3-22 whose expression is reduced
significantly in human colorectal cancers with liver metastasis.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Palmitoyltransferase specific for GAP43 and DLG4/PSD95
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Palmitoyl-CoA + protein-cysteine = S-palmitoyl
    protein + CoA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitously expressed. Reduced expression in
    colorectal cancers.
-!- DOMAIN: The DHHC domain is required for palmitoyltransferase
    activity (By similarity).
-!- DISEASE: Mutations in ZDHHC2 are found in hepatocellular carcinoma
    and colorectal cancer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DHHC palmitoyltransferase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DHHC-type zinc finger.
