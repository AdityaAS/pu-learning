AC   O67083;
Ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.1) (Protoheme ferro-lyase) (Heme
synthetase).
"The complete genome of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex
aeolicus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the ferrous insertion into protoporphyrin IX.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protoporphyrin + Fe(2+) = protoheme + 2 H(+).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; protoheme biosynthesis; protoheme
    from protoporphyrin-IX: single step [final step].
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ferrochelatase family.
Complete proteome; Heme biosynthesis; Iron; Lyase; Metal-binding;
