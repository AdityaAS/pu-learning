Opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) (Zeta-type opioid receptor).
"Cloning, sequencing, expression and function of a cDNA encoding a
receptor for the opioid growth factor, [Met(5)]enkephalin.";
"The biology of the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr).";
"Quantitative phosphoproteomics of vasopressin-sensitive renal cells:
regulation of aquaporin-2 phosphorylation at two sites.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for opioid growth factor (OGF), also known as
    Met-enkephalin. Seems to be involved in growth regulation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm; perinuclear region. Nucleus.
    Note=The OGF/OGFR complex is probably translocated to the nucleus.
    Colocalized with OGF in the perinuclear region.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in 6-day old cerebellum and
    brain. Lower expressed in adult cerebellum. The protein is
    detected in germinal cells of the cerebellum, in neurons of the
    deep cerebellar nuclei and in the glia in the medullary layer.
