A/G-specific adenine glycosylase (EC 3.2.2.-).
"MutY, an adenine glycosylase active on G-A mispairs, has homology to
endonuclease III.";
"Nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli micA gene required for
A/G-specific mismatch repair: identity of micA and mutY.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"MutY catalytic core, mutant and bound adenine structures define
specificity for DNA repair enzyme superfamily.";
-!- FUNCTION: Adenine glycosylase active on G-A mispairs. MutY also
    corrects error-prone DNA synthesis past go lesions which are due
    to the oxidatively damaged form of guanine: 7,8-dihydro-8-
    oxoguanine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster. The cluster is not important for
    the catalytic activity, but which is probably involved in the
    proper positioning of the enzyme along the DNA strand.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nth/mutY family.
