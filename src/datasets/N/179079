AC   Q9RTT6;
Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.16) (Cysteine--tRNA ligase)
(CysRS).
"Genome sequence of the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus
radiodurans R1.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-cysteine + tRNA(Cys) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-cysteinyl-tRNA(Cys).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
