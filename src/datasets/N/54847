Ferredoxin-like protein fixX.
"Systematic sequencing of the Escherichia coli genome: analysis of the
0-2.4 min region.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"The fix Escherichia coli region contains four genes related to
carnitine metabolism.";
"The fixA and fixB genes are necessary for anaerobic carnitine
reduction in Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Could be part of an electron transfer system required
    for anaerobic carnitine reduction. Could be a 3Fe-4S cluster-
    containing protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial-type ferredoxin family. FixX
    subfamily.
