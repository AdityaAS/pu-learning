AC   Q58362;
Prefoldin alpha subunit 1 (GimC alpha subunit 1).
"Complete genome sequence of the methanogenic archaeon, Methanococcus
jannaschii.";
-!- FUNCTION: Molecular chaperone capable of stabilizing a range of
    proteins. Seems to fulfil an ATP-independent, HSP70-like function
    in archaeal de novo protein folding (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterohexamer of two alpha and four beta subunits (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prefoldin alpha subunit family.
Chaperone; Complete proteome.
