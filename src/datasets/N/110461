NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 2
(EC 1.6.5.3) (EC 1.6.99.3) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B8 subunit)
(Complex I-B8) (CI-B8).

-!- FUNCTION: Transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory
    chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed
    to be ubiquinone (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone = NAD(+) + ubiquinol.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + acceptor = NAD(+) + reduced acceptor.
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex I is composed of 45 different subunits (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    matrix side (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Acetylation of Lys-63 and Lys-74 is observed in liver
    mitochondria from fasted mice but not from fed mice.
