AC   P96920;
Exodeoxyribonuclease V beta chain (EC 3.1.11.5).
"Deciphering the biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the
complete genome sequence.";
"Whole-genome comparison of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical and
laboratory strains.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for efficient DNA repair; it catalyzes the
    unwinding of double-stranded DNA and the cleavage of single-
    stranded DNA and it stimulates local genetic recombination. All of
    these activities require concomitant hydrolysis of ATP (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Exonucleolytic cleavage (in the presence of
    ATP) in either 5'- to 3'- or 3'- to 5'-direction to yield 5'-
    phosphooligonucleotides.
-!- SUBUNIT: Consist of three subunits; recB, recC and recD (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the helicase family. UvrD subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 uvrD-like helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 uvrD-like helicase C-terminal domain.
