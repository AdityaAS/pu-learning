AC   Q9W790;
T-complex protein 1 subunit alpha (TCP-1-alpha) (CCT-alpha).
"Origin of gene overlap: the case of TCP1 and ACAT2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Molecular chaperone; assist the folding of proteins upon
    ATP hydrolysis. Known to play a role, in vitro, in the folding of
    actin and tubulin (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Hetero-oligomeric complex of about 850 to 900 kDa that
    forms two stacked rings, 12 to 16 nm in diameter (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TCP-1 chaperonin family.
ATP-binding; Chaperone; Nucleotide-binding.
