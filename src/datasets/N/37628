AC   Q9KP21;
Adenylyl-sulfate kinase (EC 2.7.1.25) (APS kinase) (Adenosine-5'-
phosphosulfate kinase) (ATP adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate 3'-
phosphotransferase).
"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the synthesis of activated sulfate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + adenylyl sulfate = ADP + 3'-
    phosphoadenylyl sulfate.
-!- PATHWAY: Sulfur metabolism; hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis; sulfite
    from sulfate: step 2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the APS kinase family.
