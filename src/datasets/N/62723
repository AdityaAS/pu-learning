AC   Q6MAS9;
Glycogen synthase (EC 2.4.1.21) (Starch [bacterial glycogen]
synthase).
"Illuminating the evolutionary history of chlamydiae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Synthesizes alpha-1,4-glucan chains using ADP-glucose.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ADP-glucose + (1,4-alpha-D-glucosyl)(n) = ADP
    + (1,4-alpha-D-glucosyl)(n+1).
-!- PATHWAY: Glycogen biosynthesis; second step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 1 family.
    Bacterial/plant glycogen synthase subfamily.
 GO:0005978; P:glycogen biosynthesis; IEA:HAMAP.
