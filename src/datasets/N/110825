Nuclear export protein (NEP) (Non-structural protein 2) (NS2).
"Synthesis, cloning and determination of the primary structure of a
full-size DNA copy of fragment 8 from the influenza virus type A
genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates the nuclear export of encapsidated genomic RNAs
    (ribonucleoproteins, RNPs). Acts as an adapter between viral RNPs
    complexes and the nuclear export machinery of the cell. Possesses
    no intrinsic RNA-binding activity, but includes a C-terminal M1-
    binding domain. This domain is believed to allow recognition of
    RNPs to which the M1 protein is bound. Because the M1 protein is
    not available in large quantities until the later stages of
    infection, such an indirect recognition mechanism probably ensures
    that genomic RNPs are not exported from the nucleus before
    sufficient quantities of viral mRNA and progeny genomic RNA have
    been synthesized. Furthermore, the RNPs enters the cytoplasm only
    when they have associated with the M1 protein that is necessary to
    guide them to the plasma membrane. May down-regulate viral RNA
    synthesis when overproduced (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds M1 protein. May interact with human nucleoporin
    RAB/HRB and exportin XPO1/CRM1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
