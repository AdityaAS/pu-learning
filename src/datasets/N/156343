AC   Q5HGU4;
Ribonuclease HIII (EC 3.1.26.4) (RNase HIII).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Endonuclease that specifically degrades the RNA of RNA-
    DNA hybrids (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage to 5'-
    phosphomonoester.
-!- COFACTOR: Manganese or magnesium. Binds 1 divalent metal ion per
    monomer in the absence of substrate. May bind a second metal ion
    after substrate binding (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNase HII family. RnhC subfamily.
