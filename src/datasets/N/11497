AC   P14217;
Arylsulfatase precursor (EC 3.1.6.1) (AS) (Aryl-sulfate
sulphohydrolase).
"Structure and expression of the gene encoding the periplasmic
arylsulfatase of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A phenol sulfate + H(2)O = a phenol + sulfate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- INDUCTION: By sulfur deprivation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sulfatase family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (CAA34302 and CAA36545) sequences differ from that
    shown due to several frameshifts.
Direct protein sequencing; Glycoprotein; Hydrolase; Periplasmic;
