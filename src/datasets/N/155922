AC   Q5M807;
E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF5 (EC 6.3.2.-) (RING finger protein 5).
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Has E2-dependent E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity.
    May function together with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes
    UBE2D1/UBCH5A and UBE2D2/UBC4. Mediates ubiquitination of
    PXN/paxillin. May be involved in regulation of cell motility and
    localization of PXN/paxillin (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PXN (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential). Note=Predominantly located in the plasma membrane,
    with some localization occurring within cytoplasmic organelles.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RING-type zinc finger.
