AC   P16976;
GTP-binding protein YPTM1.
"Molecular cloning and structural analysis of genes from Zea mays (L.)
coding for members of the ras-related ypt gene family.";
"Identification of guanine-nucleotide binding proteins in plants:
structural analysis and evolutionary comparisons of the ras-related
ypt-gene family from Zea mays.";
-!- FUNCTION: Protein transport. Probably involved in vesicular
    traffic (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; cytoplasmic
    side (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Low levels in coleoptiles.
-!- PTM: The palmitic acid is required for membrane attachment and
    biological function.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small GTPase superfamily. Rab family.
