AC   Q8R5U4;
Putative threonine-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.81) (L-threonine-
O-3-phosphate decarboxylase).
"A complete sequence of the T. tengcongensis genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Decarboxylates L-threonine-O-3-phosphate to yield (R)-1-
    amino-2-propanol O-2-phosphate, the precursor for the linkage
    between the nucleotide loop and the corrin ring in cobalamin (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-threonine O-3-phosphate = (R)-1-aminopropan-
    2-yl phosphate + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
    aminotransferase family.
