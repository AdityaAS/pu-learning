AC   P31171;
Prenyl transferase (EC 2.5.1.-).
"An ORF323 with homology to crtE, specifying prephytoene pyrophosphate
dehydrogenase, is encoded by cyanelle DNA in the eukaryotic alga
Cyanophora paradoxa.";
"Nucleotide sequence of the cyanelle DNA from Cyanophora paradoxa.";
"The complete sequence of the cyanelle genome of Cyanophora paradoxa:
the genetic complexity of a primitive plastid.";
"The cyanelle S10 spc ribosomal protein gene operon from Cyanophora
paradoxa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Possible role in synthesis of the nonaprenyl side chain
    of plastoquinone or in synthesis of other prenyl chains such as
    undekaprenyl pyrophosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; cyanelle.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FPP/GGPP synthetase family.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1) called crtE.
