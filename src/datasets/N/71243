"The primary structure of haemoglobin from amur-leopard (Panthera

-!- FUNCTION: Involved in oxygen transport from the lung to the
    various peripheral tissues.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer of two alpha chains and two beta chains.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Red blood cells.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: In the cat family (felidae), the oxygen affinity of
    hemoglobin depends little or not at all on the association with

-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the globin family.
