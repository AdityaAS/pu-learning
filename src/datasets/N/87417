AC   Q8ZGA4;
3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.38) (CMP-KDO
synthetase) (CMP-2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid synthetase) (CKS).
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague.";
"Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis KIM.";
"Complete genome sequence of Yersinia pestis strain 91001, an isolate
avirulent to humans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Activates KDO (a required 8-carbon sugar) for
    incorporation into bacterial lipopolysaccharide in Gram-negative
    bacteria (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CTP + 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate =
    diphosphate + CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate.
-!- PATHWAY: Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis; KDO biosynthesis; fourth
    step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the kdsB family.
Complete proteome; Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis;
Nucleotidyltransferase; Transferase.
