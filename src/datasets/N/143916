-!- FUNCTION: Required for normal induction of mutations by physical
    and chemical agents. Has a deoxycytidyl transferase activity which
    transfers a dCMP residue from dCTP to the 3'-end of a DNA primer
    in a template-dependent reaction. May assist in the first step in
    the bypass of abasic lesions by the insertion of a nucleotide
    opposite the lesion.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer. Binds POLH, POLI and POLK (By similarity). Binds
    MAD2L2 and REV3L. May bind ITGA3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
