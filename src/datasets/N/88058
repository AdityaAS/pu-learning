Kinase A inhibitor (Sporulation inhibitor kipI).

degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome and similarity
analysis of the products of putative ORFs.";

"A novel histidine kinase inhibitor regulating development in Bacillus
subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Is a potent inhibitor of the autophosphorylation
    reaction of kinase A and its reverse reaction, but does not
    inhibit phosphate transfer to the Spo0F response regulator once
    kinase A is phosphorylated. KipI is an inhibitor of the catalytic
    domain of kinase A affecting the ATP/ADP reactions and not the
    phosphotransferase functions of this domain. The inhibition is
    noncompetitive with respect to ATP.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with kipA, which prevents the inhibitory action
    of kipI.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by glucose when readily available sources of
    nitrogen, such as ammonia or glutamine, are scarce.
-!- CAUTION: Was originally (Ref.1 and Ref.2) thought to be a longer
    ORF that encodes what is now known to be kipI and kipA.
