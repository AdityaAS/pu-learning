AC   Q9CET2;
Chorismate synthase (EC 4.2.3.5) (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate
phospholyase).
"The complete genome sequence of the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus
lactis ssp. lactis IL1403.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5-O-(1-carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshikimate =
    chorismate + phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Reduced flavin (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; chorismate
    biosynthesis; chorismate from D-erythrose 4-phosphate and PEP:
    step 7 [final step].
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Aromatic amino acids biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chorismate synthase family.
