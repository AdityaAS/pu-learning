AC   P31951; Q9RIA5;
Antigen 85-B precursor (85B) (Extracellular alpha-antigen) (Antigen 85
complex B) (Ag85B) (Mycolyl transferase 85B) (EC 2.3.1.-)
(Fibronectin-binding protein B).
"Nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for the 85-B antigen of
Mycobacterium leprae.";
"Massive gene decay in the leprosy bacillus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Proteins of the antigen 85 complex are responsible for
    the high affinity of mycobacteria to fibronectin. Possesses a
    mycolyltransferase activity required for the biogenesis of
    trehalose dimycolate (cord factor), a dominant structure necessary
    for maintaining cell wall integrity (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mycobacterial A85 antigen family.
