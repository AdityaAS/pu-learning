Neuropeptides capa receptor (Cap2b receptor).
"Identification of G protein-coupled receptors for Drosophila PRXamide
peptides, CCAP, corazonin, and AKH supports a theory of ligand-
receptor coevolution.";
"Molecular cloning and functional expression of a Drosophila receptor
for the neuropeptides capa-1 and -2.";
"The genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster.";
"Annotation of the Drosophila melanogaster euchromatic genome: a
systematic review.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts as a receptor for the neuropeptides CAP-1 and CAP-
    2, but not CAP-3. Probably a component of signal transduction
    pathway that leads to Malpighian tubule fluid secretion in
    response to these ligands.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: In adults, expression in thorax and/or
    abdomen.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed weakly in 16-24 hours embryos and
    second instar larvae and strongly in first and third instar larvae
    and adults.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
