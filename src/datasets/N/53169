-!- FUNCTION: Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates
    RAC1. Plays a role in the response to class 3 semaphorins and
    remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PLXNA1. Interaction with PLXNA1 or PIP5K1C
    lowers its guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Dissociates from
    PLXNA1 when SEMA3A binds to the receptor. Interacts with PIP5K1C
    via its FERM domain. The interaction with PIP5K1C is enhanced by
    SEMA3A binding.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Detected in adult brain, lung and testis.
    Detected in embryonic hippocampus and brain cortex.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DH (DBL-homology) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 FERM domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 PH domains.
Guanine-nucleotide releasing factor; Repeat.
