project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The secreted protein discovery initiative (SPDI), a large-scale
effort to identify novel human secreted and transmembrane proteins: a

"Characterization of a mammalian Golgi-localized protein complex, COG,
that is required for normal Golgi morphology and function.";
"Mutation of the COG complex subunit gene COG7 causes a lethal
congenital disorder.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for normal Golgi function (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the conserved oligomeric Golgi complex which
    is composed of eight different subunits and is required for normal
    Golgi morphology and localization.

    Q9H9E3:COG4; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-389534, EBI-368382;
    Q9UP83:COG5; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-389534, EBI-389502;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in COG7 are the cause of congenital disorder of
    glycosylation type IIe (CDG-IIe) [MIM:608779]. Congenital
    disorders of glycosylation are metabolic deficiencies in
    glycoprotein biosynthesis that usually cause severe mental and
    psychomotor retardation. They are characterized by under-
    glycosylated serum glycoproteins and are caused by mutations in
    genes encoding proteins involved in the stepwise assembly of
    dolichol-oligosaccharide used for protein N-glycosylation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the COG7 family.
