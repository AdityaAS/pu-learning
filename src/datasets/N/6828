AC   Q4R684;
Archaemetzincin-2 (EC 3.-.-.-) (Archeobacterial metalloproteinase-like
protein 2).
"DNA sequences of macaque genes expressed in brain or testis and its
evolutionary implications.";
-!- FUNCTION: Zinc metalloprotease. Exhibits activity against
    angiotensin-3 in vitro. Does not hydrolyze neurogranin nor
    angiotensin-2 (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by the general metalloprotease
    inhibitors o-phenanthroline and batimastat. Also significantly
    inhibited by amastatin, which is an inhibitor of aminopeptidases.
    Not inhibited by 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, E-64,
    and TIMPS (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases), which are
    inhibitors of serine, cysteine, and matrix metalloproteases,
    respectively (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase archaemetzincin family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to a stop
    codon in position 307 which was translated as Arg to extend the
    sequence.
Hydrolase; Metal-binding; Metalloprotease; Protease; Zinc.
