AC   Q7UI46;
Vitamin B12-dependent ribonucleotide reductase (EC 1.17.4.1)
(Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase nrdJ).
"Complete genome sequence of the marine planctomycete Pirellula sp.
strain 1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides to
    deoxyribonucleotides. May function to provide a pool of
    deoxyribonucleotide precursors for DNA repair during oxygen
    limitation and/or for immediate growth after restoration of oxygen
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2'-deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate +
    thioredoxin disulfide + H(2)O = ribonucleoside diphosphate +
    thioredoxin.
-!- COFACTOR: 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamine (coenzyme B12) (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase
    class-2 family.
