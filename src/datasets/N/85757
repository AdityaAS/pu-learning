-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the organization of myofibers. Together with
    KRT8, helps to link the contractile apparatus to dystrophin at the
    costameres of striated muscle (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer of two type I and two type II keratins.
    Interacts with PNN (By similarity). Interacts with the actin-
    binding domain of DMD.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P11530:Dmd; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-876985, EBI-706166;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in brain, heart, skin and in
    costameres of myoplasm at the sarcolemmal membrane in skeletal and
    cardiac muscle fibers. Undifferentiated gonads and somatic cells
    of ovarian cords throughout the fetal ovary development.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Found in somatic cells of ovarian cords
    throughout the fetal ovary development.
-!- DOMAIN: This keratin differs from all other IF proteins in lacking
    the C-terminal tail domain.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: There are two types of cytoskeletal and
    microfibrillar keratin, I (acidic; 40-55 kDa) [K9 to K20] and II
    (neutral to basic; 56-70 kDa) [K1 to K8].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the intermediate filament family.
