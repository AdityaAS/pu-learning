subunit) (Calcium-activated neutral proteinase 2) (CANP 2) (Calpain M-
type) (M-calpain) (Millimolar-calpain) (80 kDa M-calpain subunit)

-!- FUNCTION: Calcium-regulated non-lysosomal thiol-protease which
    catalyze limited proteolysis of substrates involved in
    cytoskeletal remodelling and signal transduction (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Broad endopeptidase specificity.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 3 calcium ions.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activated by 200-1000 micromolar concentrations
    of calcium and inhibited by calpastatin.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a heterodimer with a small (regulatory) subunit
    (CAPNS1).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Cell membrane (By
    similarity). Note=Translocates to the plasma membrane upon Ca(2+)
    binding (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase C2 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 calpain catalytic domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 EF-hand domains.
