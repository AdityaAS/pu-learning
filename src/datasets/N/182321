AC   Q3SH24;
Prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.15) (Proline--tRNA ligase) (ProRS).
"The genome sequence of the obligately chemolithoautotrophic,
facultatively anaerobic bacterium Thiobacillus denitrificans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the attachment of proline to tRNA(Pro) in a
    two-step reaction: proline is first activated by ATP to form Pro-
    AMP and then transferred to the acceptor end of tRNA(Pro). As
    ProRS can inadvertently accomodate and process noncognate amino
    acids such as alanine and cysteine, to avoid such errors it has
    two additional distinct editing activities against alanine. One
    activity is designated as 'pretransfer' editing and involves the
    tRNA(Pro)-independent hydrolysis of activated Ala-AMP. The other
    activity is designated 'posttransfer' editing and involves
    deacylation of mischarged Ala-tRNA(Pro). The misacylated Cys-
    tRNA(Pro) is not edited by ProRS (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-proline + tRNA(Pro) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-prolyl-tRNA(Pro).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Consists of three domains: the N-terminal catalytic
    domain, the editing domain and the C-terminal anticodon-binding
    domain (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family. ProS type 1 subfamily.
