Calmodulin-A (CaM A) (Fragment).
"Four synonymous genes encode calmodulin in the teleost fish, medaka
(Oryzias latipes): conservation of the multigene one-protein
principle.";
-!- FUNCTION: Calmodulin mediates the control of a large number of
    enzymes and other proteins by Ca(2+). Among the enzymes to be
    stimulated by the calmodulin-Ca(2+) complex are a number of
    protein kinases and phosphatases.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein has four functional calcium-binding
    sites.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 EF-hand domains.
Calcium; Methylation; Repeat.
