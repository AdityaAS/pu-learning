Transcriptional regulatory protein cutR (Defective melC1 suppressor
protein).
"Complete genome sequence of the model actinomycete Streptomyces
coelicolor A3(2).";
-!- FUNCTION: Member of the two-component regulatory system cutS/cutR,
    involved in the regulation of copper metabolism. CutR suppresses a
    defective melC1 gene, encoding a putative copper-transfer gene,
    probably by altering copper metabolism (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 response regulatory domain.
