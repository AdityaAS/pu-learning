-!- FUNCTION: Endothelins are endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor
    peptides.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in lung, but not in placental stem
    villi vessels or cultured placental villi smooth muscle cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the endothelin/sarafotoxin family.
