AC   Q6DFU4;
Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 26A-B (Vesicle protein
sorting 26A-B).
-!- FUNCTION: Essential component of the retromer complex, a complex
    required to retrieve lysosomal enzyme receptors (IGF2R and M6PR)
    from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. Also required to
    regulate transcytosis of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor
    (pIgR-pIgA) (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the retromer complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Endosome; endosomal membrane;
    peripheral membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the VPS26 family.
