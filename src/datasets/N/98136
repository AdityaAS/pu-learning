-!- FUNCTION: Plays a crucial role in virion assembly and budding.
    Forms a shell at the inner face of the plasma membrane and
    concentrates the HN and F glycoproteins. Acts as a negative
    regulator for transcription and replication by sticking to the
    nucleocapsid. This effect might be regulated by the cytoplasmic
    interaction with tubulin that dissociates the M protein from the
    nucleocapsid (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homomultimer. Binds to the cytoplasmic regions of F and
    HN proteins. Interacts with nucleocapsid. Interacts with human
    alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Note=During bud
    formation, associates at the inner side of the plasma membrane of
    infected cells (By similarity).
-!- PTM: A large portion is phosphorylated in the cytoplasm, but not
    in virion. However, this phosphorylation is not essential for
    virus replication (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the paramyxoviruses M protein family.
