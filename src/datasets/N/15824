Transcription factor BAF1 (ARS-binding factor 1) (Protein ABF1)
(Bidirectionally acting factor).
"Kluyveromyces contains a functional ABF1-homologue.";
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Trans-acting factor in the regulation of transcription
    and in DNA replication. Involved in the transcription activation
    of a subset of ribosomal protein genes. Binds the ARS-elements
    found in many promoters. Binds to the sequence 5'-TCN(7)ACG-3'.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- PTM: Extensively phosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the BAF1 family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to frameshifts
    in positions 300 and 379.
