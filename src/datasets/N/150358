AC   Q888C7;
50S ribosomal protein L25 (General stress protein CTC).
"The complete genome sequence of the Arabidopsis and tomato pathogen
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the proteins that binds to the 5S RNA in
    the ribosome where it forms part of the central protuberance (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit; part of the 5S
    rRNA/L5/L18/L25 subcomplex. Contacts the 5S rRNA. Binds to the 5S
    rRNA independently of L5 and L18 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L25P family. Ctc
    subfamily.
Complete proteome; Ribonucleoprotein; Ribosomal protein; RNA-binding;
rRNA-binding.
