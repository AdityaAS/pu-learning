AC   P0A1S0; P15430;
Integration host factor alpha-subunit (IHF-alpha).
"Nucleotide sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium himA gene.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is one of the two subunits of integration
    host factor, a specific DNA-binding protein that functions in
    genetic recombination as well as in transcriptional and
    translational control.
-!- FUNCTION: IHF also plays a crucial role in the lysogenic life
    cycle of bacteriophage lambda, as it is required not only in the
    recombination reaction, which inserts lambda DNA into the E.coli
    chromosome, but also for the synthesis of int and cI repressor,
    two phage proteins necessary for DNA insertion and repression,
    respectively. The synthesis of int and cI proteins is regulated
    indirectly by IHF via translational control of the lambda cII
    protein.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta chain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial histone-like protein family.
