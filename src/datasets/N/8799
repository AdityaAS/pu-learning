AC   Q92ZT0;
Carbamate kinase (EC 2.7.2.2).
"Nucleotide sequence and predicted functions of the entire
Sinorhizobium meliloti pSymA megaplasmid.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + NH(3) + CO(2) = ADP + carbamoyl
    phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid degradation; L-arginine degradation via ADI
    pathway; CO(2) and NH(3) from L-arginine: step 3 [final step].
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the carbamate kinase family.
Arginine metabolism; Complete proteome; Kinase; Plasmid; Transferase.
