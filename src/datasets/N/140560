AC   P21867;
HTH-type transcriptional regulator rafR (Raffinose operon repressor).
"Regulatory elements of the raffinose operon: nucleotide sequences of
operator and repressor genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: The raffinose (raf) operon is negatively controlled by
    the specific binding of raf repressor to raf operator (rafO) DNA.
    Binds raffinose as an inducer.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HTH lacI-type DNA-binding domain.
Direct protein sequencing; DNA-binding; Plasmid; Repressor;
