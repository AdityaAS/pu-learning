AC   Q9USH1;
RNA polymerase II mediator complex subunit 31 (Cell separation protein
sep10) (Soh1 homolog).
"The Schizosaccharomyces pombe genes sep10 and sep11 encode putative
general transcriptional regulators involved in multiple cellular
processes.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: Potential component of the mediator complex is essential
    for basal and regulated expression of nearly all RNA polymerase
    II-dependent genes. Mediator complex may act as a bridge,
    conveying regulatory information from enhancers and other control
    elements to the promoter.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mediator complex subunit 31 family.
