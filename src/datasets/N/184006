AC   O05052;
Putative type I restriction enzyme HindVIIP R protein (EC 3.1.21.3).
"Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae
Rd.";
-!- FUNCTION: Subunit R is required for both nuclease and ATPase
    activities, but not for modification (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA to give random
    double-stranded fragments with terminal 5'-phosphates; ATP is
    simultaneously hydrolyzed.
-!- SUBUNIT: The type I restriction/modification system is composed of
    three polypeptides R, M and S (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hsdR family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
