Protein phosphatase 2C homolog 2 (EC 3.1.3.16) (PP2C-2).
"Counteractive roles of protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) and a MAP kinase
kinase homolog in the osmoregulation of fission yeast.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: Has an important role in osmotic stability and cell
    shape control. It may negatively regulate the osmosensing signal
    transmitted through wis1 map kinase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A phosphoprotein + H(2)O = a protein +
    phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium or manganese ions per subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PP2C family.
