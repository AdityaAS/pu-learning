"Nonheme iron proteins. IV. Structural studies of Micrococcus
aerogenes rubredoxin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Rubredoxin is a small nonheme, iron protein lacking
    acid-labile sulfide. Its single Fe, chelated to 4 Cys, functions
    as an electron acceptor and may also stabilize the conformation of
    the molecule.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 Fe(3+) ion per subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the rubredoxin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 rubredoxin-like domain.
