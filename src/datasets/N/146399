Chloroplast 50S ribosomal protein L20.
"The chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences of the charophyte
Chaetosphaeridium globosum: insights into the timing of the events
that restructured organelle DNAs within the green algal lineage that
led to land plants.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds directly to 23S ribosomal RNA and is necessary for
    the in vitro assembly process of the 50S ribosomal subunit. It is
    not involved in the protein synthesizing functions of that subunit
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L20P family.
