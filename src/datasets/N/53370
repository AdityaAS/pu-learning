-!- FUNCTION: Substrate-recognition component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-
    box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Directly interacts with SKP1A and CUL1 (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=O94952-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O94952-2; Sequence=VSP_013056;
      Note=May be due to a competing acceptor splice site. No
      experimental confirmation available;
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 F-box domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 sequence differs from that shown due to a stop
    codon in position 81 which was translated as Trp to extend the
    sequence.
