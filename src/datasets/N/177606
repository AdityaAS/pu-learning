AC   Q8BZ60;
Stonin-2 (Stoned B).
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Adapter protein involved in endocytic machinery. May be
    involved in the vesicle recycling. May facilitate clathrin-coated
    vesicle uncoating (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with the second C2 domain of synaptotagmins
    SYT1 and SYT2. Interacts with EPS15, EPS15R and ITSN1. Interacts
    indirectly with the AP-2 adapter complex (By similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P18484:Ap2a2 (xeno); NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-539385, EBI-539360;
    P84092:Ap2m1 (xeno); NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-539385, EBI-297693;
    P21707:Syt1 (xeno); NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-539385, EBI-458098;
-!- DOMAIN: The Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) motifs, which are found in proteins
    involved in the endocytic pathway, mediate the interaction with
    the EH domain of SYT1, SYT2, EPS15, EPS15R and ITSN1 (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Stoned B family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 MHD (mu homology) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SHD (stonin homology) domain.
