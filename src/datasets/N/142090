-!- FUNCTION: Component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) and the
    CBC(VHL) (CUL2-elonging BC-VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes,
    which mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal
    degradation of target proteins involved in cell cycle progression,
    signal transduction and transcription. Through the RING-type zinc
    finger, seems to recruit the E2 ubiquitination enzyme, like CDC34,
    to the complex and brings it into close proximity to the
    substrate. Probably also stimulates CDC34 autoubiquitination.
    Promotes the neddylation of CUL1 and probably CUL2. May be
    required for histone H3 and histone H4 ubiquitination in response
    to ultraviolet and for subsequent DNA repair.
-!- PATHWAY: Ubiquitin conjugation; third step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of a SCF complex consisting of CUL1, RBX1, SKP1 and
    SKP2. Part of a SCF-like complex consisting of CUL7, RBX1, SKP1
    and FBXW8. Part of CBC(VHL) complexes with elongin BC complex
    (TCEB1 and TCEB2), CUL2 or CUL5 and VHL. Part of multisubunit E3
    ubiquitin ligase complexes with elongin BC complex (TCEB1 and
    TCEB2), CUL2 and MED8; elongin BC complex (TCEB1 and TCEB2), CUL5
    and MUF1. Part of multisubunit complexes with elongin BC complex
    (TCEB1 and TCEB2), elongin A/TCEB3 or SOCS1 or WSB1 and CUL5.
    Interacts directly with CUL1 and probably also with CUL2, CUL3,
    CUL4A, CUL4B, CUL5 and CUL7. Probably interacts with CDC34.
    Interacts with COPS6. Component of the DCX DET1-COP1 ubiquitin
    ligase complex at least composed of RBX1, DET1, DDB1, CUL4A and
    COP1. Part of an E3 ligase complex composed of RBX1, DDB1, DDB2
    and CUL4A or CUL4B.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q13616:CUL1; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-398523, EBI-359390;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed.
-!- DOMAIN: The RING-type zinc finger domain is essential for
    ubiquitin ligase activity. It coordinates an additional third zinc
    ion.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RING-box family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RING-type zinc finger.
