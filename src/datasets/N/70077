AC   Q27443;
Histone H4.
"Histone H4 mRNA from the nematode Ascaris lumbricoides is cis-spliced
and polyadenylated.";
-!- FUNCTION: Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and
    compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the
    cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones
    thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA
    repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA
    accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational
    modifications of histones, also called histone code, and
    nucleosome remodelling.
-!- SUBUNIT: The nucleosome is a histone octamer containing two
    molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 assembled in one H3-H4
    heterotetramer and two H2A-H2B heterodimers. The octamer wraps
    approximately 147 bp of DNA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the histone H4 family.
Acetylation; Chromosomal protein; DNA-binding; Methylation;
Nuclear protein; Nucleosome core.
