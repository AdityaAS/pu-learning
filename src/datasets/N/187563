"The partitioned Rhizobium etli genome: genetic and metabolic
redundancy in seven interacting replicons.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the synthesis of the hydromethylpyrimidine
    (HMP) moiety of thiamine (4-amino-2-methyl-5-
    hydroxymethylpyrimidine) (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; thiamine pyrophosphate
    biosynthesis; 4-amino-2-methyl-5-diphosphomethylpyrimidine from 5-
    amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole: step 1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the thiC family.
