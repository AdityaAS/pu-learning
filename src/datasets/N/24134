-!- FUNCTION: Apoptosis regulator protein which may function as a
    crucial link between cell survival and cell death pathways in
    mammalian cells. Acts as an inhibitor of TNFRSF6 mediated
    apoptosis. A proteolytic fragment (p43) is likely retained in the
    death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) thereby blocking further
    recruitment and processing of caspase-8 at the complex. Full
    length and shorter isoforms have been shown either to induce
    apoptosis or to reduce TNFRSF-triggered apoptosis. Lacks enzymatic
    (caspase) activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: TNFRSF6 stimulation triggers recruitment to the death-
    inducing signaling complex (DISC) formed by TNFRSF6, FADD and
    caspase-8. A proteolytic fragment (p43) stays associated with the
    DISC (By similarity).

      IsoId=O35732-2; Sequence=VSP_000842, VSP_000843;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in heart.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: At embryonic days E9.5 and E10.5 highest
    expression in developing heart.
-!- INDUCTION: Isoform 1 but not isoform 2 is activated by BCR cross-
    linking in primary B-cells.
-!- DOMAIN: The caspase domain lacks the active sites residues
    involved in catalysis.
-!- PTM: Proteolytically processed; probably by caspase-8. Processing
    likely occurs at the DISC and generates subunit p43 and p12 (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase C14 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 DED (death effector) domains.
