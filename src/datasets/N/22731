AC   Q3C2E2;
B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (Membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A
member 1).
"Canine CD20 gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein may be involved in the regulation of B-cell
    activation and proliferation (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By
    similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in PBMCs and lymph node from healthy
    dogs, in B-cells of canine lymphoma, but not in T-cell lymphoma
    cells and non-T and non-B-cell lymphoma cells.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated. Might be functionally regulated by protein
    kinase(s) (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MS4A family.
