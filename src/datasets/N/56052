AC   P27691;
Fimbrial protein precursor (Pilin) (Serogroup B1/AC127).
"Sequence of fimbrial subunit-encoding genes from virulent and benign
isolates of Dichelobacter (Bacteroides) nodosus.";
-!- SUBUNIT: The pili are polar flexible filaments of about 5.4
    nanometers diameter and 2.5 micrometers average length; they
    consist of only a single polypeptide chain arranged in a helical
    configuration of five subunits per turn in the assembled pilus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the N-Me-Phe pili family.
Fimbria; Methylation.
