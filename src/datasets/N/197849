AC   Q5ZIE6;
NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 regulatory subunit (Amyloid protein-binding
protein 1) (APP-BP1).
"Full-length cDNAs from chicken bursal lymphocytes to facilitate gene
function analysis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Regulatory subunit of the dimeric UBE1C-APPBP1 E1
    enzyme. E1 activates NEDD8 by first adenylating its C-terminal
    glycine residue with ATP, thereafter linking this residue to the
    side chain of the catalytic cysteine, yielding a NEDD8-UBE1C
    thioester and free AMP. E1 finally transfers NEDD8 to the
    catalytic cysteine of UBE2M (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: NEDD8 conjugation; first step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of UBE1C and APPBP1. The complex binds NEDD8
    and UBE2M (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ubiquitin-activating E1 family. ULA1
    subfamily.
Ligase; Ubl conjugation pathway.
