Allantoicase (EC 3.5.3.4) (Allantoate amidinohydrolase) (Fragment).
"Allantoate amidinohydrolase (Allantoicase) from Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii: its purification and catalytic and molecular
characterization.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the degradation of allantoate to (-)-
    ureidoglycolate and (+)-ureidoglycolate to glyoxylate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Allantoate + H(2)O = (S)-ureidoglycolate +
    urea.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=2.0 mM for allantoate;
      KM=0.7 mM for ureidoglycolate;
      Note=Vmax of the reaction with allantoate as substrate is nine
      times higher than that with ureidoglycolate;
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 6.5 with allantoate as substrate, and 8 with
      ureidoglycolate as substrate;
    Temperature dependence:
      Optimum temperature is 60 degrees Celsius;
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide metabolism; purine metabolism.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homohexamer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the allantoicase family.
