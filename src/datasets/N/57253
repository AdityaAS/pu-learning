AC   Q6U830;
Follitropin subunit beta precursor (Follicle-stimulating hormone beta
subunit) (FSH-beta) (FSH-B) (Follitropin beta chain).
"Sequence analysis of cDNA encoding follicle-stimulating hormone and
luteinizing hormone beta-subunits in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones
unguiculatus).";
-!- FUNCTION: Stimulates development of follicle and spermatogenesis
    in the reproductive organs (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a common alpha chain and a unique beta
    chain which confers biological specificity to thyrotropin,
    lutropin, follitropin and gonadotropin (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycoprotein hormones subunit beta
    family.
