AC   Q5LWZ5;
3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.85) (Beta-IPM dehydrogenase)
(IMDH) (3-IPM-DH).
"Genome sequence of Silicibacter pomeroyi reveals adaptations to the
marine environment.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the oxidation of 3-carboxy-2-hydroxy-4-
    methylpentanoate (3-isopropylmalate) to 3-carboxy-4-methyl-2-
    oxopentanoate. The product decarboxylates to 4-methyl-2
    oxopentanoate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3-carboxy-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoate +
    NAD(+) = 3-carboxy-4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate + NADH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium or manganese ion per subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-leucine biosynthesis; L-
    leucine from 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate: step 3.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the isocitrate and isopropylmalate
    dehydrogenases family. LeuB type 1 subfamily.
