-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found in a variety of normal tissues including
    spleen, testes, thymus, liver, kidney, brain, adrenal, lung and
    retinal tissue.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Potentially represents an important therapeutic
    reagent for HLA-A24 patients. This antigen is recognized by tumor-
    infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) 1290 in the context of HLA-A24.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L28P family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
