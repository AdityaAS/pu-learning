-!- FUNCTION: PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes
    the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in
    oligopeptides. Acts as a regulatory subunit for TAP42-associated
    PP2A-like phosphatases modulating their activity or substrate
    specificity, probably by inducing a conformational change in the
    catalytic subunit, a direct target of the PPIase. Can reactivate
    inactive phosphatase PP2A-phosphatase methylesterase complexes
    (PP2Ai) in presence of ATP and Mg(2+) by dissociating the inactive
    form from the complex. Involved in the regulation of cell cycle
    progression, mitotic spindle formation, bud morphogenesis and DNA
    repair.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Peptidylproline (omega=180) = peptidylproline
    (omega=0).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with the phosphatase PP2A-like catalytic
    subunits PPG1, PPH3 and SIT4. Forms a ternary complex with SIT4-
    TAP42.

-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 4590 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PTPA-type PPIase family.
