Undecaprenyl-diphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.27) (Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate
phosphatase) (Bacitracin resistance protein).
"Role of mobile DNA in the evolution of vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus faecalis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the dephosphorylation of undecaprenyl
    diphosphate (UPP). Confers resistance to bacitracin (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Undecaprenyl diphosphate + H(2)O =
    undecaprenyl phosphate + phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Bacitracin is thought to be involved in the
    inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis by sequestering undecaprenyl
    diphosphate, thereby reducing the pool of lipid carrier available.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the uppP family.
