AC   P41804;
Highly acidic elicitin 26 precursor.
"Characterization of a gene cluster of Phytophthora cryptogea which
codes for elicitins, proteins inducing a hypersensitive-like response
in tobacco.";
-!- FUNCTION: Induces local and distal defense responses (incompatible
    hypersensitive reaction) in plants from the solanaceae and
    cruciferae families. Elicit leaf necrosis and cause the
    accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins. Might interact with
    the lipidic molecules of the plasma membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the elicitin family.
Hypersensitive response elicitation; Signal.
