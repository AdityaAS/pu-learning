Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.10) (OPRT) (OPRTase).
"Whole genome comparisons of serotype 4b and 1/2a strains of the food-
borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes reveal new insights into the
core genome components of this species.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Orotidine 5'-phosphate + diphosphate = orotate
    + 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; UMP biosynthesis; UMP from
    HCO(3)(-): step 5.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Pyrimidine biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the purine/pyrimidine
    phosphoribosyltransferase family. PyrE subfamily.
