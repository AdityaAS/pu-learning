-!- FUNCTION: Glycosyltransferase which participates in glycosylation
    of alpha-dystroglycan. May carry out the synthesis of glycoprotein
    and glycosphingolipid sugar chains. May be involved in the
    addition of a repeated disaccharide unit.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycosylation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane;
    single-pass type II membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=O95461-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O95461-2; Sequence=VSP_014536;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous. Highest expression in heart, brain
    and skeletal muscle.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in LARGE are the cause of congenital muscular
    dystrophy type 1D (MDC1D) [MIM:608840]. The congenital muscular
    dystrophies (CMD) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive
    disorders presenting in infancy with muscle weakness,
    contractures, and dystrophic changes on skeletal muscle biopsy.
    Structural brain defects, with or without mental retardation, are
    additional features of several CMD syndromes. MDC1D presented with
    congenital muscular dystrophy, profound mental retardation, and
    white matter changes and subtle structural abnormalities on brain
    MRI. Patient skeletal muscle biopsy showed reduced immunolabeling
    of alpha-dystroglycan.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 8 family.
