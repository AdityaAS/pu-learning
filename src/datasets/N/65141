-!- FUNCTION: Interconversion of serine and glycine.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + glycine +
    H(2)O = tetrahydrofolate + L-serine.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: One-carbon metabolism; tetrahydrofolate pathway.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P22035:BAS1; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-7744, EBI-3428;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: In eukaryotes there are two forms of the enzymes: a
    cytosolic one and a mitochondrial one.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 67600 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SHMT family.
