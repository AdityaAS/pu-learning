AC   Q8MX41;
Chitinase-like protein Idgf1 precursor (Imaginal disk growth factor
protein 1).
"Polymorphism patterns in two tightly linked developmental genes,
Idgf1 and Idgf3, of Drosophila melanogaster.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cooperates with insulin-like peptides to stimulate the
    proliferation, polarization and motility of imaginal disk cells.
    May act by stabilizing the binding of insulin-like peptides to its
    receptor through a simultaneous interaction with both molecules to
    form a multiprotein signaling complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
    Note=Secreted in hemolymph (By similarity). It is probably
    transported to target tissues via hemolymph (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Glycosylated (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Lacks the typical Glu active site in position 150
    that is replaced by a Gln residue, preventing the hydrolase
    activity. Its precise function remains unclear.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 18 family. IDGF
    subfamily.
