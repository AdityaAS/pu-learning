Small inducible cytokine A21a precursor (CCL21) (Beta chemokine
exodus-2) (6Ckine) (Thymus-derived chemotactic agent 4) (TCA4).
"Isolation and characterization of Exodus-2, a novel C-C chemokine
with a unique 37-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension.";
"The reduced expression of 6Ckine in the plt mouse results from the
deletion of one of two 6Ckine genes.";
"Gene duplications at the chemokine locus on mouse chromosome 4:
multiple strain-specific haplotypes and the deletion of secondary
lymphoid-organ chemokine and EBI-1 ligand chemokine genes in the plt
mutation.";
"A chemokine expressed in lymphoid high endothelial venules promotes
the adhesion and chemotaxis of naive T lymphocytes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits hemopoiesis and stimulate chemotaxis.
    Chemotactic in vitro for thymocytes and activated T-cells, but not
    for B-cells, macrophages, or neutrophils. Potent mesangial cell
    chemoattractant. Shows preferential activity towards naive T-
    cells. May play a role in mediating homing of lymphocytes to
    secondary lymphoid organs. Binds to CCR7 and to CXCR3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed strongly in lung, spleen, thymus,
    peripheral and mesentric lymph nodes. Also expressed in the
    testis, kidney, liver, and heart.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Two genes code for CCL21, they express proteins
    that only differ at one position, CCL21A has Leu-65 (6Ckine-Leu)
    while CCL21B has 'Ser-65' (6Ckine-Ser).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the intercrine beta (chemokine CC) family.
