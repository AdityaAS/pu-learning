AC   Q5KFV5; Q55QB1;
Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase D (EC 5.2.1.8) (PPIase D)
(Rotamase D).
"The genome of the basidiomycetous yeast and human pathogen
Cryptococcus neoformans.";
-!- FUNCTION: PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes
    the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in
    oligopeptides (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Peptidylproline (omega=180) = peptidylproline
    (omega=0).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cyclophilin-type PPIase family. PPIase
    D subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PPIase cyclophilin-type domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 TPR repeats.
Complete proteome; Isomerase; Repeat; Rotamase; TPR repeat.
