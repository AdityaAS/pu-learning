Adapter protein mecA.
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: Enables the recognition and targeting of unfolded and
    aggregated proteins to the clpC protease or to other proteins
    involved in proteolysis (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal domain probably binds unfolded/aggregated
    proteins; the C-terminal domain interacts with ClpC.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mecA family.
