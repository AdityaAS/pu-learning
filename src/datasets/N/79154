AC   P0C127;
Auxin-responsive protein IAA16 (Indoleacetic acid-induced protein 16).
"A fine physical map of the rice chromosome 5.";
"Structure and expression analysis of early auxin-responsive Aux/IAA
gene family in rice (Oryza sativa).";
-!- FUNCTION: Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived transcriptional factors
    that function as repressor of early auxin response genes at low
    auxin concentrations (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homo and heterodimers (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in roots, flowers and seedlings.
-!- INDUCTION: Not induced by auxin.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Aux/IAA family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Aux/IAA-ARF domain.
