-!- FUNCTION: Sequence-specific transcription factor which is part of
    a developmental regulatory system that provides cells with
    specific positional identities on the anterior-posterior axis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: At the 10-somite stage, expressed in the
    paraxial mesoderm with an anterior expression limit at somite 4.
    At the 20-somite stage, expressed in the developing CNS with an
    anterior expression limit adjacent to the somite 1/somite 2
    boundary, and also expressed in the presumptive pronephric ducts.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Antp homeobox family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 homeobox DNA-binding domain.
