AC   P54789;
Origin recognition complex subunit 1.
"Conserved initiator proteins in eukaryotes.";
"Orp1, a member of the Cdc18/Cdc6 family of S-phase regulators, is
homologous to a component of the origin recognition complex.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"Identification and reconstitution of the origin recognition complex
from Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"Purification and characterization of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe
origin recognition complex: interaction with origin DNA and Cdc18
protein.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the origin recognition complex (ORC) that
    binds origins of replication. It has a role in both chromosomal
    replication and mating type transcriptional silencing. ORC binds
    to multiple sites within the ars1 origin of DNA replication in an
    ATP-independent manner.
-!- SUBUNIT: ORC is composed of six subunits. ORC interacts with
    cdc18, recruiting it to the ars1 origin of replication.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed constitutively during the cell
    cycle.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ORC1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 BAH domain.
