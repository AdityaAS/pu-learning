AC   Q669L8;
Thymidylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.9) (dTMP kinase).
"Insights into the evolution of Yersinia pestis through whole-genome
comparison with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Phosphorylation of dTMP to form dTDP in both de novo and
    salvage pathways of dTTP synthesis (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + dTMP = ADP + dTDP.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the thymidylate kinase family.
