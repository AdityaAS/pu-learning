Sucrose-phosphate synthase 2 (EC 2.4.1.14) (UDP-glucose-fructose-
phosphate glucosyltransferase 2).
"Analysis of cDNA clones encoding sucrose-phosphate synthase in
relation to sugar interconversions associated with dehydration in the
resurrection plant Craterostigma plantagineum Hochst.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the regulation of carbon partitioning in the
    leaves of plants. May regulate the synthesis of sucrose and
    therefore play a major role as a limiting factor in the export of
    photoassimilates out of the leaf.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-glucose + D-fructose 6-phosphate = UDP +
    sucrose 6-phosphate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activity regulated by phosphorylation and
    moderated by concentration of metabolites and light.
-!- PATHWAY: Sucrose synthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer or homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated. However, phosphorylation is not essential for
    enzyme function (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 1 family.
