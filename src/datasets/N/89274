Ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-5 (EC 2.7.11.1) (Nuclear mitogen-
and stress-activated protein kinase 1) (90 kDa ribosomal protein S6
kinase 5) (RSK-like protein kinase) (RSKL).

-!- FUNCTION: Serine/threonine kinase required for the mitogen or
    stress-induced phosphorylation of the transcription factors CREB
    (cAMP response element-binding protein) and ATF1 (activating
    transcription factor-1). Essential role in the control of RELA
    transcriptional activity in response to TNF. Directly represses
    transcription via phosphorylation of 'Ser-1' of histone H2A.
    Mediates the mitogen- and stress-induced phosphorylation of
    histone H3 and high mobility group protein 14 (HMG-14).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Appears to be activated by multiple
    phosphorylations on threonine and serine residues. ERK1/2 and
    MAPK14/p38alpha may play a role in this process.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a complex with either ERK1 or ERK2 in quiescent
    cells which transiently dissociates following mitogenic
    stimulation. Also associates with MAPK14/p38alpha. Activated
    RPS6KA5 associates with and phosphorylates the NF-kappa-B p65
    subunit RELA.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q04206:RELA; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-73869, EBI-73886;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Cytoplasm. Note=Predominantly
    nuclear. Partially cytoplasmic.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed with high levels in heart,
    brain and placenta. Less abundant in lung, kidney and liver.
-!- PTM: Ser-376 and Thr-581 phosphorylation is required for kinase
    activity. Ser-376 and Ser-212 are autophosphorylated by the C-
    terminal kinase domain, and their phosphorylation is essential for
    the catalytic activity of the N-terminal kinase domain.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Enzyme activity requires the presence of both
    kinase domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. S6
    kinase subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 protein kinase domains.
