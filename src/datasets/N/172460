"Deciphering the biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the
complete genome sequence.";
"Whole-genome comparison of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical and
laboratory strains.";
"Siroheme- and [Fe4-S4]-dependent NirA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis
is a sulfite reductase with a covalent Cys-Tyr bond in the active
site.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: H(2)S + 3 oxidized ferredoxin + 3 H(2)O =
    sulfite + 3 reduced ferredoxin.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 siroheme per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster per subunit.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nitrite and sulfite reductase 4Fe-4S
    domain family.
