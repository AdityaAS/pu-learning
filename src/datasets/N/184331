AC   P08764;
Type III restriction-modification system EcoPI enzyme res
(EC 3.1.21.5).
"Type III DNA restriction and modification systems EcoP1 and EcoP15.
Nucleotide sequence of the EcoP1 operon, the EcoP15 mod gene and some
EcoP1 mod mutants.";
"Genome of bacteriophage P1.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein cuts the DNA some 25 base-pairs to the 3'-
    end of the recognition site. It is only required for restriction
    but needs the presence of the modification enzyme.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA to give
    specific double-stranded fragments with terminal 5'-phosphates.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium.
-!- SUBUNIT: Contains two different subunits: res and mod.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type III restriction-modification
    system res protein family.
