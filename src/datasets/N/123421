AC   Q8UDU5;
Pyridoxal phosphate biosynthetic protein pdxJ (PNP synthase).
"The genome of the natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens
C58.";
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen and biotechnology agent
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the condensation of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-
    phosphate (DXP) and 1-amino-3-(phosphohydroxy)propan-2-one to form
    pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: De novo synthesis of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and
    pyridoxal phosphate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pdxJ family.
