AC   P03587; O41352;
RNA-directed RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.48) (183 kDa protein) [Contains:
Methyltransferase/RNA helicase (MT/HEL) (126 kDa protein)].
"Nucleotide sequence of the tobacco mosaic virus (tomato strain)
genome and comparison with the common strain genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: The longer protein is a RNA polymerase active in viral
    RNA replication.
-!- FUNCTION: The smaller protein is a methyltransferase active in RNA
    capping and an RNA helicase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Readthrough of the terminator codon UAG occurs
    between codons for Gln-1116 and Gln-1118.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RdRp catalytic domain.
ATP-binding; Helicase; Hydrolase; Nucleotide-binding;
