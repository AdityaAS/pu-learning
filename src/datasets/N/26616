-!- FUNCTION: Possesses microtubule stabilizing properties. Involved
    in regulating aneuploidy, cell cycling, and cell death in a
    p53/TP53-dependent manner (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Associates with alpha- and beta-tubulins (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Note=Colocalizes with
    microtubules throughout the cell cycle.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q8WWK9-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q8WWK9-2; Sequence=VSP_052093, VSP_052094;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
    Name=3;
      IsoId=Q8WWK9-3; Sequence=VSP_052094;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Abundant in testis, thymus, and in tumor
    derived cell lines, while barely detectable in liver, prostate,
    and kidney.
-!- INDUCTION: Up-regulated in primary human gastric cancers.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.7 (AAG33675) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 607.
