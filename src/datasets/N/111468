AC   Q9UVL1;
Nonhistone chromosomal protein 6.
"CaNHP6 encodes a high mobility group (HMG)-like protein that
influences cell and colony morphology in Candida albicans.";
"The diploid genome sequence of Candida albicans.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-binding protein that induces severe bending of DNA.
    Required for DNA-binding by the FACT complex, a general chromatin
    factor that acts to reorganize nucleosomes. The FACT complex is
    involved in multiple processes that require DNA as a template such
    as mRNA elongation, DNA replication and DNA repair. Also augments
    the fidelity of transcription by RNA polymerase III independently
    of any role in the FACT complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Weakly associates with the stable SPT16-POB3 heterodimer
    to form the FACT complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NHP6 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HMG box DNA-binding domain.
