AC   Q9MTN8;
Photosystem I P700 chlorophyll a apoprotein A1 (PsaA) (PSI-A).
"Complete nucleotide sequence of the Oenothera elata plastid
chromosome, representing plastome I of the five distinguishable
Euoenothera plastomes.";
-!- FUNCTION: PsaA and psaB bind P700, the primary electron donor of
    photosystem I (PSI), as well as the electron acceptors A0, A1 and
    FX. PSI is a plastocyanin-ferredoxin oxidoreductase, converting
    photonic excitation into a charge separation, which transfers an
    electron from the donor P700 chlorophyll pair to the
    spectroscopically characterized acceptors A0, A1, FX, FA and FB in
    turn. Oxidized P700 is reduced on the lumenal side of the
    thylakoid membrane by plastocyanin.
-!- COFACTOR: P700 is a chlorophyll a/chlorophyll a' dimer, A0 is one
    or more chlorophyll a, A1 is one or both phylloquinones and FX is
    a shared 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur center (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The psaA/B heterodimer binds the P700 chlorophyll special
    pair and subsequent electron acceptors. PSI consists of a core
    antenna complex that captures photons, and an electron transfer
    chain that converts photonic excitation into a charge separation.
    The eukaryotic PSI reaction center is composed of at least 11
    subunits (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the psaA/psaB family.
