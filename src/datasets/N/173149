-!- FUNCTION: The SMN complex plays an essential role in spliceosomal
    snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm and is required for pre-mRNA
    splicing in the nucleus. It may also play a role in the metabolism
    of snoRNPs (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of an import snRNP complex composed of KPNB1,
    RNUT1, SMN1 and ZNF259. Part of the core SMN complex that contains
    SMN1, SIP1/GEMIN2, DDX20/GEMIN3, GEMIN4, GEMIN5, GEMIN6, GEMIN7,
    GEMIN8 and STRAP/UNRIP. Interacts with DDX20, FBL, NOLA1, RNUT1
    and with several spliceosomal snRNP core Sm proteins, including
    SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE and with ILF3. Interacts with
    OSTF1 (By similarity). Interacts with SYNCRIP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity). Note=Localized in subnuclear structures next to
    coiled bodies, called Gemini of Cajal bodies (Gems) (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SMN family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Tudor domain.
