AC   Q47281;
Type I restriction enzyme EcoEI R protein (EC 3.1.21.3) (R.EcoEI).
"Conservation of motifs within the unusually variable polypeptide
sequences of type I restriction and modification enzymes.";
-!- FUNCTION: The EcoEI enzyme recognizes 5'-GAGN(7)ATGC-3'. Subunit R
    is required for both nuclease and ATPase activities, but not for
    modification.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA to give random
    double-stranded fragments with terminal 5'-phosphates; ATP is
    simultaneously hydrolyzed.
-!- SUBUNIT: The type I restriction/modification system is composed of
    three polypeptides R, M and S.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Type I restriction and modification enzymes are
    complex, multifunctional systems which require ATP, S-adenosyl
    methionine and magnesium as cofactors and, in addition to their
    endonucleolytic and methylase activities, are potent DNA-dependent
    ATPases.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hsdR family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase C-terminal domain.
