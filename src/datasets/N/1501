Homeobox protein abdominal-A homolog (Fragment).
"HOM/Hox genes of Artemia: implications for the origin of insect and
crustacea body plans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for segmental identity of the second through
    eighth abdominal segments. Once a pattern of abdA expression is
    turned on in a given parasegment, it remains on the more posterior
    parasegment, so that the complex pattern of expression is built up
    in the successive parasegments. The abdA product appears to
    repress expression of Ubx whenever they appear in the same cell,
    but abdA is repressed by AbdB only in the eight and ninth
    abdominal segments.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Antp homeobox family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 homeobox DNA-binding domain.
