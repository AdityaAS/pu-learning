-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4-phospho-D-erythronate + NAD(+) = (3R)-3-
    hydroxy-2-oxo-4-phosphonooxybutanoate + NADH.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; pyridoxine 5'-phosphate
    biosynthesis; pyridoxine 5'-phosphate from D-erythrose 4-
    phosphate: step 2.
-!- INDUCTION: During growth rate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid
    dehydrogenase family.
