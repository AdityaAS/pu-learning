AC   P58130;
Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15) (GPAT).
"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acyl-CoA + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate = CoA + 1-
    acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: De novo phospholipid biosynthesis; first step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; peripheral membrane protein
    (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The HXXXXD motif is essential for acyltransferase activity
    and may constitute the binding site for the phosphate moiety of
    the glycerol-3-phosphate (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GPAT/DAPAT family.
