-!- FUNCTION: The JNK-interacting protein (JIP) group of scaffold
    proteins selectively mediates JNK signaling by aggregating
    specific components of the MAPK cascade to form a functional JNK
    signaling module. JIP2 inhibits IL1 beta-induced apoptosis in
    insulin-secreting cells. May function as a regulator of vesicle
    transport, through interations with the JNK-signaling components
    and motor proteins (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms homo- or heterooligomeric complexes. Binds specific
    components of the JNK signaling pathway namely JNK, MAPKK7 and
    MLK2, MLK3 and DLK. Also binds the proline-rich domain-containing
    splice variant of apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2). Binds the
    cytoplasmic tails of LRP1 and LRP2 (Megalin). Binds the TPR motif-
    containing C-terminal of kinesin light chain, Klc1, pre-assembled
    MAPK8IP1 scaffolding complexes are then transported as a cargo of
    kinesin, to the required subcellular location (By similarity).
    Interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of APP (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Note=Accumulates in cell surface
    projections.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed mainly in the brain and pancreas,
    including insulin-secreting cells. In the nervous system, more
    abundantly expressed in the cerebellum, pituitary gland, occipital
    lobe and the amygdala. Also expressed in fetal brain. Very low
    levels found in uterus, ovary, prostate, colon, testis, adrenal
    gland, thyroid gland and salivary gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the JIP scaffold family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PID domain.
