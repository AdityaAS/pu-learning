AC   Q9RBJ2;
Putative cellulose synthase 2 [Includes: Cellulose synthase catalytic
subunit [UDP-forming] (EC 2.4.1.12); Cyclic di-GMP-binding domain
(Cellulose synthase 2 regulatory subunit)].
"Cloning of cellulose synthase genes from Acetobacter xylinum JCM
7664: implication of a novel set of cellulose synthase genes.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-glucose + (1,4-beta-D-glucosyl)(n) = UDP +
    (1,4-beta-D-glucosyl)(n+1).
-!- PATHWAY: Bacterial cellulose biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- DOMAIN: There are two conserved domains in the globular part of
    the catalytic subunit: the N-terminal domain (domain A) contains
    the conserved DXD motif and is possibly involved in catalysis and
    substrate binding. The C-terminal domain (domain B) contains the
    QXXRW motif and is present only in processive glycosyl
    transferases. It could be involved in the processivity function of
    the enzyme, possibly required for holding the growing glycan chain
    in the active site.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the
    glycosyltransferase 2 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the acsB/bcsB
    family.
