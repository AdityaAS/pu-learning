AC   O91740;
Polymerase basic protein 2 (RNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit P3).
"Phylogenetic analysis of the entire genome of influenza A (H3N2)
viruses from Japan: evidence for genetic reassortment of the six
internal genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in transcription initiation and cap-stealing
    mechanism, in which cellular capped pre-mRNA are used to generate
    primers for viral transcription. Binds the cap of the target pre-
    RNA which is subsequently cleaved by PB1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Influenza RNA polymerase is composed of three subunits:
    PB1, PB2 and PA.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the influenza viruses PB2 family.
mRNA capping; mRNA processing.
