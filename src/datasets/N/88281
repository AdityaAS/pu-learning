AC   Q2HWD6;
Mast/stem cell growth factor receptor precursor (EC 2.7.10.1) (SCFR)
(Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Kit) (c-kit) (CD117 antigen).
"Sus scrofa KIT gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is the receptor for stem cell factor (mast cell
    growth factor). It has a tyrosine-protein kinase activity. Binding
    of the ligands leads to the autophosphorylation of KIT and its
    association with substrates such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
    (Pi3K) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + a
    [protein]-L-tyrosine phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with APS and MPDZ (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Tyr protein kinase family. CSF-1/PDGF
    receptor subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
