Involucrin.
"The involucrin genes of the mouse and the rat: study of their shared
repeats.";
"Identification and characterization of a novel component of the
cornified envelope, cornifelin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of the insoluble cornified cell envelope (CE) of
    stratified squamous epithelia.
-!- SUBUNIT: Directly or indirectly cross-linked to cornifelin (CNFN).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Note=Constituent of the
    scaffolding of the cornified envelope.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Keratinocytes of epidermis and other
    stratified squamous epithelia.
-!- PTM: Substrate of transglutaminase. Specific glutamines or lysines
    are cross-linked to keratins, desmoplakin and to inter involucrin
    molecules.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the involucrin family.
Keratinization; Repeat.
