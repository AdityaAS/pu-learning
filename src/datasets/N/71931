AC   P26505;
5-aminolevulinate synthase (EC 2.3.1.37) (5-aminolevulinic acid
synthase) (Delta-aminolevulinate synthase) (Delta-ALA synthetase).
"Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the hemA gene of Agrobacterium
radiobacter.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Succinyl-CoA + glycine = 5-aminolevulinate +
    CoA + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; porphyrin biosynthesis; 5-
    aminolevulinate from glycine: single step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
    aminotransferase family.
Acyltransferase; Heme biosynthesis; Pyridoxal phosphate; Transferase.
