AC   P82352;
Sarcospan.
"Membrane targeting and stabilization of sarcospan is mediated by the
sarcoglycan subcomplex.";
"Sarcospan, the 25-kDa transmembrane component of the dystrophin-
glycoprotein complex.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC),
    a complex that spans the muscle plasma membrane and forms a link
    between the F-actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.
    Preferentially associates with the sarcoglycan subcomplex of the
    DGC.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; sarcolemma; multi-pass
    membrane protein. Note=Also found in myotendinous junctions and in
    the postsynaptic membrane of neuromuscular junctions.
