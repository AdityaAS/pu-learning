AC   P87102; Q7S694;
Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF-2).
"What's in the genome of a filamentous fungus? Analysis of the
Neurospora genome sequence.";
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Facilitates protein transport into the nucleus. Could be
    part of a multicomponent system of cytosolic factors that assemble
    at the pore complex during nuclear import (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 NTF2 domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (EAA31056) sequence differs from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
