-!- FUNCTION: IF-3 binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and shifts the
    equilibrum between 70S ribosomes and their 50S and 30S subunits in
    favor of the free subunits, thus enhancing the availability of 30S
    subunits on which protein synthesis initiation begins.
-!- FUNCTION: IF-3 is also a translational repressor protein, it
    controls the translation of its own gene by binding to its mRNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Exists in 2 main forms, IF-3L and IF-3S. There is
    at least one minor form that differs from IF-3L only in the
    absence of the first residue.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IF-3 family.
