AC   P34721;
Modification methylase MboIB (EC 2.1.1.72) (Adenine-specific
methyltransferase MboIB) (M.MboIB) (M.MboI C).
"Gene structure and expression of the MboI restriction-modification
system.";
-!- FUNCTION: This methylase recognizes the double-stranded sequence
    GATC, causes specific methylation on A-2 on both strands, and
    protects the DNA from cleavage by the MboI endonuclease.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + DNA adenine = S-
    adenosyl-L-homocysteine + DNA 6-methylaminopurine.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The MboI restriction system has two different
    methylases.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the N4/N6-methyltransferase family.
