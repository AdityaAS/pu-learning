L-arabinose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.4).
"The Bacillus subtilis L-arabinose (ara) operon: nucleotide sequence,
genetic organization and expression.";
"The dnaB-pheA (256 degrees-240 degrees) region of the Bacillus
subtilis chromosome containing genes responsible for stress responses,
the utilization of plant cell walls and primary metabolism.";
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"Mode of action of AraR, the key regulator of L-arabinose metabolism
in Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-arabinose = L-ribulose.
-!- PATHWAY: L-arabinose catabolism; first step.
-!- INDUCTION: Transcription is repressed by glucose and by the
    binding of araR to the operon promoter. L-arabinose acts as an
    inducer by inhibiting the binding of araR to the DNA, thus
    allowing expression of the gene.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the arabinose isomerase family.
