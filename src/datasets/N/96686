AC   P92524; Q8GUT8;
Hypothetical mitochondrial protein AtMg00880 (ORF187).
"The mitochondrial genome of Arabidopsis thaliana contains 57 genes in
366,924 nucleotides.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 2 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Analysis of the cDNAs of hypothetical genes on Arabidopsis chromosome
2 reveals numerous transcript variants.";
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion (Potential).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: A stretch of 270 kb of the mitochondrial genome is
    duplicated within the centromer of chromosome 2 resulting in the
    duplication of the gene. The expression of this duplicated gene
    (At2g07682) is demonstrated.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 and Ref.3 sequences differ from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 180.
Hypothetical protein; Mitochondrion.
