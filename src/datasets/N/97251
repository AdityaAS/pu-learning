Pheromone receptor transcription activator (Protein map1).
"Schizosaccharomyces pombe map1+ encodes a MADS-box-family protein
required for cell-type-specific gene expression.";
"The Schizosaccharomyces pombe map1 gene encodes an SRF/MCM1-related
protein required for P-cell specific gene expression.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: In response to mating-pheromone signaling or nitrogen
    starvation, it interacts with mat1-Pc. This activates the
    expression of one of two mating-type-specific genes sxa2 or map3,
    which leads to inactivation of the P-factor. May also interact
    with mat1-Mc.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 MADS-box domain.
