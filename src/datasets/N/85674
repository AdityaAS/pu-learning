AC   O23826;
125 kDa kinesin-related protein.
"TKRP125, a kinesin-related protein involved in the centrosome-
independent organization of the cytokinetic apparatus in tobacco BY-2
cells.";
"Isolation of polypeptides with microtubule-translocating activity
from phragmoplasts of tobacco BY-2 cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for microtubule translocation. May be
    important for the organization of phragmoplast-specific arrays of
    microtubules.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Cytoplasm; cytoskeleton.
    Note=Microtubule-associated.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed during S phase. Expression
    increases as cell moves from S phase to M phase and then decreases
    rapidly as cell enters the G1 phase. Expression increases again
    during the G2 phase.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the kinesin-like protein family. BimC
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 kinesin-motor domain.
ATP-binding; Coiled coil; Direct protein sequencing; Microtubule;
Motor protein; Nucleotide-binding.
