Band 4.1-like protein 1 (Neuronal protein 4.1) (4.1N).
"Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes. VII.
The complete sequences of 100 new cDNA clones from brain which can
code for large proteins in vitro.";
"The DNA sequence and comparative analysis of human chromosome 20.";
"PIKE: A nuclear GTPase that enhances PI3kinase activity and is
regulated by protein 4.1N.";

phosphorylation analysis and site localization.";
-!- FUNCTION: May function to confer stability and plasticity to
    neuronal membrane via multiple interactions, including the
    spectrin-actin-based cytoskeleton, integral membrane channels and
    membrane-associated guanylate kinases.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with CENTG1.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highest expression in brain, lower in heart,
    kidney, pancreas, placenta, lung and skeletal muscle.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 FERM domain.
