AC   P43151;
Putative guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha.
"Characterisation and expression of a G-alpha protein gene from
Leishmania donovani.";
-!- FUNCTION: Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are
    involved as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane
    signaling systems.
-!- SUBUNIT: G proteins are composed of 3 units; alpha, beta and
    gamma. The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding
    site.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the G-alpha
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the class-II
    aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 has shown that this sequence seems to be an hybrid
    that consists of parts of a G protein alpha subunit and a lysyl-
    tRNA synthetase.
