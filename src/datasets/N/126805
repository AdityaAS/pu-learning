function analysis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4-
    phosphate on the fifth hydroxyl of the myo-inositol ring, to form
    phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4-
    phosphate = ADP + 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PI5K domain.
Kinase; Transferase.
