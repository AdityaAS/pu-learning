-!- FUNCTION: Protection against toxic levels of iron. Stores iron in
    a soluble, non-toxic, readily available form. Important for iron
    homeostasis. Has ferroxidase activity. Iron is taken up in the
    ferrous form and deposited as ferric hydroxides after oxidation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 Fe(2+) + 4 H(+) + O(2) = 4 Fe(3+) + 2 H(2)O.
-!- SUBUNIT: Oligomer of 24 subunits. The functional molecule forms a
    roughly spherical shell with a diameter of 12 nm and contains a
    central cavity into which the insoluble ferric iron core is
    deposited (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Larvae, pupae, and adult females. Detected in
    midgut.
-!- INDUCTION: By blood meal, iron and hydrogen peroxide.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ferritin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ferritin-like diiron domain.
