AC   P55105;
Bone morphogenetic protein 8B precursor (BMP-8B).
"Evidence that mouse Bmp8a (Op2) and Bmp8b are duplicated genes that
play a role in spermatogenesis and placental development.";
-!- FUNCTION: Induces cartilage and bone formation. May be the
    osteoinductive factor responsible for the phenomenon of epithelial
    osteogenesis. Plays a role in calcium regulation and bone
    homeostasis (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer; disulfide-linked.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TGF-beta family.
