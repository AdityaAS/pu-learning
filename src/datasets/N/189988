-!- FUNCTION: Cytokine that binds to TNFRSF1A/TNFR1 and
    TNFRSF1B/TNFBR. It is mainly secreted by macrophages and can
    induce cell death of certain tumor cell lines. It is potent
    pyrogen causing fever by direct action or by stimulation of
    interleukin 1 secretion and is implicated in the induction of
    cachexia, Under certain conditions it can stimulate cell
    proliferation and induce cell differentiation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein. Processed form: Secreted protein. Note=Also exists as an
    extracellular soluble form.
-!- PTM: The soluble form derives from the membrane form by
    proteolytic processing.
-!- PTM: The membrane form, but not the soluble form, is
    phosphorylated on serine residues. Dephosphorylation of the
    membrane form occurs by binding to soluble TNFRSF1A/TNFR1 (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tumor necrosis factor family.
