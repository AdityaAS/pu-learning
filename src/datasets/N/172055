SH3-containing GRB2-like protein 2 (EC 2.3.1.-) (Endophilin-1)
(Endophilin-A1) (SH3 domain protein 2A) (EEN-B1).
"A novel SH3-containing human gene family preferentially expressed in
the central nervous system.";

"The SH3 domains of endophilin and amphiphysin bind to the proline-
rich region of synaptojanin 1 at distinct sites that display an
unconventional binding specificity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in synaptic vesicle recycling, in
    particular in clathrin-mediated vesicle endocytosis. Exhibits
    lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity (LPAAT).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: The lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase
    activity increases upon phosphorylation (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with SYNJ1 and DNM1. Also associates with
    MAP4K3. This interaction appears to regulate MAP4K3-mediated JNK
    activation.

-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein. Note=Concentrated in presynaptic nerve terminals in
    neurons.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain, mostly in frontal cortex. Expressed at
    high level in fetal cerebellum.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the endophilin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 BAR domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SH3 domain.
