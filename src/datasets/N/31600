Cytochrome P450 2B15 (EC 1.14.14.1) (CYPIIB15).
"Cloning and sequencing of a novel rat cytochrome P450 2B-encoding
gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate
    monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an
    NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It oxidizes a variety
    of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty
    acids, and xenobiotics (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: RH + reduced flavoprotein + O(2) = ROH +
    oxidized flavoprotein + H(2)O.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family.
