AC   Q9HLE5;
Shikimate kinase (EC 2.7.1.71) (SK).
"The genome sequence of the thermoacidophilic scavenger Thermoplasma
acidophilum.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + shikimate = ADP + shikimate 3-phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; chorismate
    biosynthesis; chorismate from D-erythrose 4-phosphate and PEP:
    step 5.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Aromatic amino acids biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GHMP kinase family. Archaeal shikimate
    kinase subfamily.
