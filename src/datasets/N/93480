AC   Q7NLU2;
Lipoyl synthase 2 (EC 2.8.1.-) (Lipoic acid synthase 2) (Lipoate
synthase 2) (Lipoyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase 2) (Sulfur insertion
protein lipA2) (Lip-syn 2).
"Complete genome structure of Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, a
cyanobacterium that lacks thylakoids.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the radical-mediated insertion of two sulfur
    atoms into an octanoyl group bound to acyl-carrier-protein (ACP)
    to produce a lipoyl group (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Octanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + 2 sulfurs =
    lipoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein].
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster. The cluster is coordinated with
    3 cysteines and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine (By
    similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 3Fe-4S cluster (Potential).
-!- PATHWAY: Lipoate biosynthesis; sulfur-insertion step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the biotin and lipoic acid synthetases
    family. LipA subfamily.
