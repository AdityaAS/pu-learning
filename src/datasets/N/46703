AC   Q5HKF6;
Extracellular cysteine protease precursor (EC 3.4.22.-) (Staphopain).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cysteine protease able to cleave elastin, insulin,
    myoglobin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, HMW-kininogen, alpha-1-
    protease inhibitor and alpha-1-antitrypsin. Along with other
    extracellular proteases may contribute to the colonization and
    infection of human tissues (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell wall. Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Proteolytically cleaved (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase C47 family.
