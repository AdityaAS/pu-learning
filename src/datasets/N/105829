AC   Q32BP9;
G/U mismatch-specific DNA glycosylase (EC 3.2.2.-) (Mismatch-specific
uracil DNA-glycosylase) (MUG) (Double-strand-specific uracil
glycosylase).
"Genome dynamics and diversity of Shigella species, the etiologic
agents of bacillary dysentery.";
-!- FUNCTION: Excises ethenocytosine and uracil, which can arise by
    alkylation or deamination of cytosine, respectively, from the
    corresponding mispairs with guanine in ds-DNA. It is capable of
    hydrolyzing the carbon-nitrogen bond between the sugar-phosphate
    backbone of the DNA and the mispaired base. The complementary
    strand guanine functions in substrate recognition. Required for
    DNA damage lesion repair in stationary-phase cells (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds DNA as a monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TDG/mug DNA glycosylase family.
