-!- FUNCTION: Neuronal cell surface protein thought to be involved in
    cell-cell-interactions by forming intercellular junctions through
    binding to beta-neurexins. May play a role in formation or
    maintenance of synaptic junctions. May also play a role in glia-
    glia or glia-neuron interactions in the developing peripheral
    nervous system.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with neurexin 1-beta, neurexin 2-beta and
    neurexin 3-beta (By similarity). Probably interacts through its C-
    terminus with DLG4/PSD-95 third PDZ domain.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Potential).

-!- DISEASE: Defects in NLGN3 may be the cause of susceptibility to X-
    linked autism 1 (AUTSX1) [MIM:300425]. AUTSX1 is a pervasive
    developmental disorder (PDD), prototypically characterized by
    impairments in reciprocal social interaction and communication,
    restricted and stereotyped patterns of interests and activities,
    and the presence of developmental abnormalities by 3 years of age.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in NLGN3 may be the cause of susceptibility to X-
    linked Asperger syndrome 1 (ASPGX1) [MIM:300494]. ASPGX1 is
    considered to be a form of childhood autism.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type-B carboxylesterase/lipase family.
