AC   Q829X3;
UvrABC system protein A (UvrA protein) (Excinuclease ABC subunit A).
"Genome sequence of an industrial microorganism Streptomyces
avermitilis: deducing the ability of producing secondary
metabolites.";
"Complete genome sequence and comparative analysis of the industrial
microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: The UvrABC repair system catalyzes the recognition and
    processing of DNA lesions. UvrA is an ATPase and a DNA-binding
    protein. A damage recognition complex composed of 2 uvrA and 2
    uvrB subunits scans DNA for abnormalities. When the presence of a
    lesion has been verified by uvrB, the uvrA molecules dissociate
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a heterotetramer with uvrB during the search for
    lesions (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ABC transporter family. UvrA subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ABC transporter domains.
