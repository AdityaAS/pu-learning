AC   P63264; P36660;
Chaperone-modulator protein cbpM.
"An analogue of the DnaJ molecular chaperone in Escherichia coli.";
"A 718-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 12.7-28.0 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";
"Highly accurate genome sequences of Escherichia coli K-12 strains
MG1655 and W3110.";
"CbpA, a DnaJ homolog, is a DnaK co-chaperone, and its activity is
modulated by CbpM.";
-!- FUNCTION: Interacts with cbpA and inhibits both the dnaJ-like co-
    chaperone activity and the DNA binding activity of cbpA. Together
    with cbpA, modulates the activity of the dnaK chaperone system.
    Does not inhibit the co-chaperone activity of dnaJ.
-!- INDUCTION: In late stationary phase.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cbpM family.
 GO:0030188; F:chaperone regulator activity; IEA:HAMAP.
