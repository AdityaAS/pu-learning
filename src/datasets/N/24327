AC   Q02073;
20 kDa chaperonin, chloroplast precursor (Protein Cpn21) (Chloroplast
protein Cpn10) (Chloroplast chaperonin 10) (Ch-CPN10).
"Identification, characterization, and DNA sequence of a functional
'double' groES-like chaperonin from chloroplasts of higher plants.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to function only as a cochaperonin, along with
    cpn60, and in certain cases is essential for the discharge of
    biologically active proteins from cpn60.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms stable complexes with CPN60 in the presence of ATP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the groES chaperonin family.
Chaperone; Chloroplast; Plastid; Repeat; Transit peptide.
