AC   P0A2W2; P55337; Q9R506;
Acyl carrier protein (ACP).
"Genome sequence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus: a pathogenic mechanism
distinct from that of V. cholerae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Carrier of the growing fatty acid chain in fatty acid
    biosynthesis (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: De novo fatty acid biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- PTM: 4'-phosphopantetheine is transferred from CoA to a specific
    serine of apo-ACP by acpS. This modification is essential for
    activity because fatty acids are bound in thioester linkage to the
    sulfhydryl of the prosthetic group (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 acyl carrier domain.
