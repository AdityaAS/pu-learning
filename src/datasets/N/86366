AC   P09456;
cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I-alpha regulatory subunit.
"Molecular cloning and cDNA structure of the regulatory subunit of
type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase from rat brain.";
-!- SUBUNIT: The inactive form of the enzyme is composed of two
    regulatory chains and two catalytic chains. Activation by cAMP
    produces two active catalytic monomers and a regulatory dimer that
    binds four cAMP molecules. PRKAR1A also interacts with RFC2; the
    complex may be involved in cell survival. Interacts with AKAP4 (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: The pseudophosphorylation site binds to the substrate-binding
    region of the catalytic chain, resulting in the inhibition of its
    activity.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Two types of regulatory chains are found: type I,
    which predominates in skeletal muscle, and type II, which
    predominates in cardiac muscle.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cAMP-dependent kinase regulatory chain
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 cyclic nucleotide-binding domains.
