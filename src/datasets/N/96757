Microtubule-actin cross-linking factor 1 (Actin cross-linking family
7).
"Microtubule actin cross-linking factor (MACF): a hybrid of dystonin
and dystrophin that can interact with the actin and microtubule
cytoskeletons.";
"Cloning and characterization of mouse ACF7, a novel member of the
dystonin subfamily of actin binding proteins.";
"Comprehensive identification of phosphorylation sites in postsynaptic
density preparations.";
-!- FUNCTION: F-actin-binding protein which may play a role in cross-
    linking actin to other cytoskeletal proteins. Also binds to
    microtubules.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
