AC   O13967; Q96WS3;
1,3-beta-glucan synthase component bgs2 (EC 2.4.1.34) (1,3-beta-D-
glucan-UDP glucosyltransferase) (Meiotic expression up-regulated
protein 21).
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"Comprehensive isolation of meiosis-specific genes identifies novel
proteins and unusual non-coding transcripts in Schizosaccharomyces
pombe.";
"bgs2+, a sporulation-specific glucan synthase homologue is required
for proper ascospore wall maturation in fission yeast.";
"Bgs2p, a 1,3-beta-glucan synthase subunit, is essential for
maturation of ascospore wall in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: Has a role in ascospore development where it is required
    for the assembly of a functional spore wall.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-glucose + (1,3-beta-D-glucosyl)(n) = UDP +
    (1,3-beta-D-glucosyl)(n+1).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Forespore; forespore inner membrane; multi-
    pass membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: By sporulation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 48 family.
