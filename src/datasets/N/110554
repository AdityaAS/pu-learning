NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 10
(EC 1.6.5.3) (EC 1.6.99.3) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase PDSW
subunit) (Complex I-PDSW) (CI-PDSW).
"cDNA of eight nuclear encoded subunits of NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase: human complex I cDNA characterization completed.";
"One subunit of human NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, hPDSW, located
at 16p13.3 and down-regulated in a prostate cell line.";
"Cloning and functional analysis of cDNAs with open reading frames for
300 previously undefined genes expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory
    chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed
    to be ubiquinone.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone = NAD(+) + ubiquinol.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + acceptor = NAD(+) + reduced acceptor.
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex I is composed of 45 different subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    matrix side.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I NDUFB10 subunit family.
