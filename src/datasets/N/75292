AC   Q6N2R5;
Bifunctional protein hldE [Includes: D-beta-D-heptose 7-phosphate
kinase (EC 2.7.1.-) (D-beta-D-heptose 7-phosphotransferase); D-beta-D-
heptose 1-phosphate adenosyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.-)].
"Complete genome sequence of the metabolically versatile
photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the phosphorylation of D-glycero-D-manno-
    heptose 7-phosphate at the C-1 position to form D,D-heptose-1,7-
    bisphosphate (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the ADP transfer to D-glycero-D-manno-heptose
    1-phosphate, yielding ADP-D,D-heptose (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 7-
    phosphate = ADP + D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1-
    phosphate = diphosphate + ADP-D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose.
-!- PATHWAY: ADP-L-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose biosynthesis; second
    step.
-!- PATHWAY: ADP-L-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose biosynthesis; fourth
    step.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the carbohydrate
    kinase pfkB family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the
    cytidylyltransferase family.
