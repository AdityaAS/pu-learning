AC   Q88DD7;
ATP phosphoribosyltransferase regulatory subunit.
"Complete genome sequence and comparative analysis of the
metabolically versatile Pseudomonas putida KT2440.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the first step of histidine biosynthesis.
    May allow the feedback regulation of ATP phosphoribosyltransferase
    activity by histidine (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-histidine biosynthesis; L-
    histidine from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heteromultimer composed of hisG and hisZ subunits (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This function is generally fulfilled by the C-
    terminal part of hisG, which is missing in some bacteria such as
    this one.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family. HisZ subfamily.
