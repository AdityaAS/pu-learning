AC   P45410;
[Citrate [pro-3S]-lyase] ligase (EC 6.2.1.22) (Citrate lyase
synthetase) (Acetate:SH-citrate lyase ligase).
"Klebsiella pneumoniae genes for citrate lyase and citrate lyase
ligase: localization, sequencing, and expression.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acetylation of prosthetic group (2-(5''-phosphoribosyl)-
    3'-dephosphocoenzyme-A) of the gamma subunit of citrate lyase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + acetate + [citrate (pro-3S)-lyase](thiol
    form) = AMP + diphosphate + [citrate (pro-3S)-lyase](acetyl form).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 N-acetyltransferase domain.
Ligase.
