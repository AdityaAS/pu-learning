AC   Q7NI15;
Light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase subunit N
(EC 1.18.-.-) (LI-POR subunit N) (DPOR subunit N).
"Complete genome structure of Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, a
cyanobacterium that lacks thylakoids.";
-!- FUNCTION: Uses Mg-ATP and reduced ferredoxin to reduce ring D of
    protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to form chlorophyllide a (Chlide)
    (By similarity). This reaction is light-independent.
-!- PATHWAY: Light-independent chlorophyll biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Protochlorophyllide reductase is thought to be composed
    of three subunits; chlL, chlN and chlB. Could form a
    heterotetramer of two chlB and two chlN subunits (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bchN/chlN family.
