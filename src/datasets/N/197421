UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 precursor (EC 2.4.1.-)
(UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase-like 1) (UDP--
Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase).
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Association between the 15-kDa selenoprotein and UDP-
glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum
of mammalian cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Recognizes glycoproteins with minor folding defects.
    Reglucosylates single N-glycans near the misfolded part of the
    protein, thus providing quality control for protein folding in the
    endoplasmic reticulum. Reglucosylated proteins are recognized by
    calreticulin for recycling to the endoplasmic reticulum and
    refolding or degradation (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Calcium (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Glycosylation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer as well as in a tight complex with SEP15.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    lumen (By similarity). Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate
    compartment (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal non-catalytic domain is assumed to mediate
    recognition of proteins with partial folding defects (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 8 family.
