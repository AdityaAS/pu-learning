-!- FUNCTION: Rapidly hydrolyzes choline released into the synapse. It
    can hydrolyze butyrylthiocholine.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetylcholine + H(2)O = choline + acetate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer of two active units; disulfide-linked. The
    active unit is formed by non-covalent association of the 55 kDa
    and 16 kDa subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; GPI-anchor.
    Note=Attached to the membrane of the neuronal cholinergic synapses
    by a GPI-anchor.
-!- PTM: Proteolytic cleavage leads to the formation of the 16 kDa
    subunit and the 55 kDa subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type-B carboxylesterase/lipase family.
