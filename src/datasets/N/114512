-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for neurotrophin-3 (NTF3). This is a tyrosine-
    protein kinase receptor. Known substrates for the TRK receptors
    are SHC1, PI-3 kinase, and PLCG1. TrkC isoforms containing
    insertions within the kinase domain can autophosphorylate in
    response to NT-3, but cannot mediate downstream phenotypic
    responses.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + a
    [protein]-L-tyrosine phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Exists in a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric (low
    affinity) and dimeric (high affinity) structures. Binds SH2B2.
    Interacts with SQSTM1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
