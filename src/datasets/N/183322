AC   Q5ZXL2;
Valyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.1.9) (Valine--tRNA ligase) (ValRS).
"The genomic sequence of the accidental pathogen Legionella
pneumophila.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the attachment of valine to tRNA(Val). As
    ValRS can inadvertently accommodate and process structurally
    similar amino acids such as threonine, to avoid such errors, it
    has a "posttransfer" editing activity that hydrolyzes mischarged
    Thr-tRNA(Val) in a tRNA-dependent manner (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-valine + tRNA(Val) = AMP + diphosphate
    + L-valyl-tRNA(Val).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: ValRS has two distinct active sites: one for
    aminoacylation and one for editing. The misactivated threonine is
    translocated from the active site to the editing site (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The C-terminal coiled-coil domain is crucial for
    aminoacylation activity (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family. ValS type 1 subfamily.
