-!- FUNCTION: IRBP shuttles 11-cis and all trans retinoids between the
    retinol isomerase in the pigment epithelium and the visual
    pigments in the photoreceptor cells of the retina.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein; extracellular space;
    extracellular matrix; interphotoreceptor matrix.
    Note=Interphotoreceptor matrix that permeates the space between
    the retina and the contiguous layer of pigment epithelium cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase S41A family.
