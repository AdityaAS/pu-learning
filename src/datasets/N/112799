AC   Q9XXD4;
Putative H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex subunit 2-like protein.
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for ribosome biogenesis. Part of a complex
    which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA. This involves the
    isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently
    attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Pseudouridine ("psi")
    residues may serve to stabilize the conformation of rRNAs (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein
    particle containing H/ACA-type snoRNAs (H/ACA snoRNPs).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nucleolus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L7Ae family.
