AC   Q9C169; Q7RV04;
Catalase-3 precursor (EC 1.11.1.6).
"Regulation and oxidation of two large monofunctional catalases.";
"The genome sequence of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Occurs in almost all aerobically respiring organisms and
    serves to protect cells from the toxic effects of hydrogen
    peroxide (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 H(2)O(2) = O(2) + 2 H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Heme group.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Activity is predominant during late
    exponential growth and at the start of the conidiation process.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced under stress conditions, such as H(2)O(2),
    paraquat, cadmium, heat shock, uric acid and nitrate treatment.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the catalase family.
