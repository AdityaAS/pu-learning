Aspartate aminotransferase 1 (EC 2.6.1.1) (Transaminase A).
"Genomic structure, expression and evolution of the alfalfa aspartate
aminotransferase genes.";
"Isolation and analysis of a cDNA clone that encodes an alfalfa
(Medicago sativa) aspartate aminotransferase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Important for the metabolism of amino acids and Krebs-
    cycle related organic acids. In plants, it is involved in nitrogen
    metabolism and in aspects of carbon and energy metabolism.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-aspartate + 2-oxoglutarate = oxaloacetate +
    L-glutamate.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Nodules, roots, stems and leaves, in
    decreasing order of aspartate aminotransferase 1 concentration. Is
    the predominant aspartate aminotransferase isoenzyme in roots.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: In eukaryotes there are cytoplasmic, mitochondrial
    and chloroplastic isozymes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
    aminotransferase family.
