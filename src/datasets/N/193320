AC   Q8G0F5;
Anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.18).
"The Brucella suis genome reveals fundamental similarities between
animal and plant pathogens and symbionts.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: N-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)-anthranilate +
    diphosphate = anthranilate + 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-
    diphosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-tryptophan biosynthesis; L-
    tryptophan from chorismate: step 2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase
    family.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis;
Complete proteome; Glycosyltransferase; Transferase;
