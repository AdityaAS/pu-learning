AC   Q75AF2;
NEDD8-conjugating enzyme UBC12 (EC 6.3.2.-) (RUB1-conjugating enzyme)
(RUB1-protein ligase) (Ubiquitin carrier protein 12).
"The Ashbya gossypii genome as a tool for mapping the ancient
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Accepts the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8/RUB1 from the
    UBA3-ULA1 E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to
    other proteins (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + NEDD8 + protein lysine = AMP +
    diphosphate + protein N-NEDD8yllysine.
-!- PATHWAY: NEDD8 conjugation; second step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family.
    UBC12 subfamily.
Complete proteome; Ligase; Ubl conjugation pathway.
