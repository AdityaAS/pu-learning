AC   Q6LXD8;
30S ribosomal protein S8P.
"Complete genome sequence of the genetically tractable
hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanococcus maripaludis.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly to 16S rRNA central domain where it helps coordinate
    assembly of the platform of the 30S subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S8P family.
