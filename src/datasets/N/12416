acetyltransferase) (SAT).
"Properties and structure of spermidine acetyltransferase in
Escherichia coli.";
"A 570-kb DNA sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome
corresponding to the 28.0-40.1 min region on the linkage map.";
"The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12.";

-!- FUNCTION: Regulates polyamine concentration by their degradation.
    Acts on spermidine, forming 1-N- and 8-N-acetylspermidine.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + an alkane-alpha,omega-diamine =
    CoA + an N-acetyldiamine.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the acetyltransferase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 N-acetyltransferase domain.
