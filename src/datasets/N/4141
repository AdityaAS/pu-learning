Alcohol dehydrogenase class 3 (EC 1.1.1.1) (Alcohol dehydrogenase
class III) (S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase) (EC 1.1.1.284)
(Glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase) (FDH) (FALDH) (GSH-
FDH).
"Characterization of a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde
dehydrogenase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides.";
"Complete sequence of chromosome 1 of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Oxidizes long-chain aliphatic alcohols, long-chain
    hydroxylated fatty acids and S-hydroxymethylglutathione (hmGSH) in
    increasing order of preference. Shows little or no activity with
    short-chain aliphatic alcohols.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: An alcohol + NAD(+) = an aldehyde or ketone +
    NADH.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione + NAD(P)(+) = S-
    formylglutathione + NAD(P)H.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 zinc ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenase
    family. Class-III subfamily.
