Aldehyde dehydrogenase X, mitochondrial precursor (EC 1.2.1.3)
(Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member B1) (ALDH class 2) (ALDHX)
(Fragment).
"Bovine corneal aldehyde dehydrogenases: evidence for multiple gene
products (ALDH3 and ALDHX).";
-!- FUNCTION: ALDHs play a major role in the detoxification of
    alcohol-derived acetaldehyde. They are involved in the metabolism
    of corticosteroids, biogenic amines, neurotransmitters, and lipid
    peroxidation. In the cornea, this enzyme may help in the
    absorption of the damaging UV-B, as well as in the detoxification
    of the UV-induced peroxidic aldehydes.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: An aldehyde + NAD(+) + H(2)O = an acid + NADH.
-!- PATHWAY: Ethanol utilization; second step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial matrix (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family.
