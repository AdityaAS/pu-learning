AC   O02840;
Cadherin-5 precursor (Vascular endothelial-cadherin) (VE-cadherin)
(CD144 antigen).
-!- FUNCTION: Cadherins are calcium dependent cell adhesion proteins.
    They preferentially interact with themselves in a homophilic
    manner in connecting cells; cadherins may thus contribute to the
    sorting of heterogeneous cell types. This cadherin may play a
    important role in endothelial cell biology through control of the
    cohesion and organization of the intercellular junctions. It
    associates with alpha-catenin forming a link to the cytoskeleton
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell junction; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (By similarity). Note=Found at cell-cell boundaries and
    probably at cell-matrix boundaries (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 cadherin domains.
