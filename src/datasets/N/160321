AC   Q9TJQ9;
Plastid 30S ribosomal protein S7.
"The genes encoding subunits of ATP synthase are conserved in the
reduced plastid genome of the heterotrophic alga Prototheca
wickerhamii.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly to 16S rRNA where it nucleates assembly of the head
    domain of the 30S subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S7P family.
