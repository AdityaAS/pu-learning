AC   Q61139; O08577;
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7 precursor (EC 3.4.21.-)
(Proprotein convertase PC7) (Subtilisin/kexin-like protease PC7)
(Prohormone convertase PC7) (Subtilisin-like proprotein convertase 7)
(SPC7).
"SPC4, SPC6, and the novel protease SPC7 are coexpressed with bone
morphogenetic proteins at distinct sites during embryogenesis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Likely to represent a ubiquitous endoprotease activity
    within constitutive secretory pathways and capable of cleavage at
    the RXXX[KR]R consensus motif.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Release of mature proteins from their
    proproteins by cleavage of Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Yaa-Arg-|-Zaa bonds,
    where Xaa can be any amino acid and Yaa is Arg or Lys.
-!- COFACTOR: Calcium (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by zinc and copper (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network; trans-
    Golgi network membrane; single-pass type I membrane protein (By
    similarity). Note=Seems to be localized intracellularly to the
    trans Golgi network (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Expressed in brain, lung,
    muscle, heart, liver, kidney, spleen and thymus.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Ubiquitously expressed at constitutive levels
    during embryogenesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase S8 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 homo B/P domain.
