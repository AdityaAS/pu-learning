-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-AMP + H(2)O = 1-(5-
    phosphoribosyl)-5-((5-
    phosphoribosylamino)methylideneamino)imidazole-4-carboxamide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-ATP + H(2)O = 1-(5-
    phosphoribosyl)-AMP + diphosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-histidinol + 2 NAD(+) = L-histidine + 2
    NADH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-histidine biosynthesis; L-
    histidine from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate: step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-histidine biosynthesis; L-
    histidine from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate: step 3.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-histidine biosynthesis; L-
    histidine from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate: step 9
    [final step].
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the histidinol
    dehydrogenase family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to several
    frameshifts.
