Ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase 2 (EC 2.7.6.1) (RPPK 2)
(Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 2) (P-Rib-PP synthetase 2)
(PRPP synthetase 2).
"Complete genome sequence of an M1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes.";
"Evolutionary origin and emergence of a highly successful clone of
serotype M1 group A Streptococcus involved multiple horizontal gene
transfer events.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + D-ribose 5-phosphate = AMP + 5-phospho-
    alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; 5-phospho-alpha-D-
    ribose 1-diphosphate biosynthesis; 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-
    diphosphate from D-ribose 5-phosphate (route I): single step
    [final step].
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase
    family.
