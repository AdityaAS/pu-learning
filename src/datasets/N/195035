AC   Q32AR4;
Sulfurtransferase tusA (EC 2.8.1.-) (tRNA 2-thiouridine synthesizing
protein A).
"Genome dynamics and diversity of Shigella species, the etiologic
agents of bacillary dysentery.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a sulfur-relay system required for 2-thiolation
    of 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm(5)s(2)U) at tRNA wobble
    positions. Interacts with iscS and stimulates its activity. Then,
    accepts a sulfur from iscS and transfers it in turn to tusD (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with iscS (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UPF0033 family. TusA subfamily.
