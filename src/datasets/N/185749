AC   Q9HHE9;
TATA-box-binding protein F (TATA-box factor F) (TATA sequence-binding
protein F) (TBP F) (Box A-binding protein F) (BAP F).
"Genome sequence of Halobacterium species NRC-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: General factor that plays a role in the activation of
    archaeal genes transcribed by RNA polymerase. Binds specifically
    to the TATA box promoter element which lies close to the position
    of transcription initiation (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TBP family.
