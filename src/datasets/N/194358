"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Thioredoxin + NADP(+) = thioredoxin disulfide
    + NADPH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The active site is a redox-active disulfide bond.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II pyridine nucleotide-disulfide
    oxidoreductase family.
