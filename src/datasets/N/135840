AC   Q8K8Z7;
Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.29) (PTH).
"Genome sequence of a serotype M3 strain of group A Streptococcus:
phage-encoded toxins, the high-virulence phenotype, and clone
emergence.";
"Genome sequence of an M3 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes reveals a
large-scale genomic rearrangement in invasive strains and new insights
into phage evolution.";
-!- FUNCTION: The natural substrate for this enzyme may be peptidyl-
    tRNAs which drop off the ribosome during protein synthesis (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: N-substituted aminoacyl-tRNA + H(2)O = N-
    substituted amino acid + tRNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PTH family.
Complete proteome; Hydrolase.
