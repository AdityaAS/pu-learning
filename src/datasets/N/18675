AC   P79188;
C5a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor (C5a-R) (C5aR) (CD88 antigen)
(Fragment).
"Molecular evolution of the N-formyl peptide and C5a receptors in non-
human primates.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for the chemotactic and inflammatory peptide
    anaphylatoxin C5a. This receptor stimulates chemotaxis, granule
    enzyme release and superoxide anion production.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- PTM: Sulfation plays a critical role in the association of C5aR
    with C5a, but no significant role in the ability of the receptor
    to transduce a signal and mobilize calcium in response to a small
    peptide agonist (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
