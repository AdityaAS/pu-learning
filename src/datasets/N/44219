DNA polymerase III subunit beta (EC 2.7.7.7).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA polymerase III is a complex, multichain enzyme
    responsible for most of the replicative synthesis in bacteria.
    This DNA polymerase also exhibits 3' to 5' exonuclease activity.
    The beta chain is required for initiation of replication once it
    is clamped onto DNA, it slides freely (bidirectional and ATP-
    independent) along duplex DNA (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: DNA polymerase III contains a core (composed of alpha,
    epsilon and theta chains) that associates with a tau subunit. This
    core dimerizes to form the POLIII' complex. PolIII' associates
    with the gamma complex (composed of gamma, delta, delta', psi and
    chi chains) and with the beta chain to form the complete DNA
    polymerase III complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
Complete proteome; DNA replication; DNA-directed DNA polymerase;
Nucleotidyltransferase; Transferase.
