AC   O31817;
Metallothiol transferase fosB (EC 2.5.1.-) (Fosfomycin resistance
protein).
"The complete genome sequence of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.";
"FosB, a cysteine-dependent fosfomycin resistance protein under the
control of sigma(W), an extracytoplasmic-function sigma factor in
Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Metallothiol transferase which confers resistance to
    fosfomycin by catalyzing the addition of a thiol cofactor to
    fosfomycin. L-cysteine is probably the physiological thiol donor.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: Expression is sigma W-dependent.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fosfomycin resistance protein family.
    FosB subfamily.
