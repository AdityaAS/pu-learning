AC   Q9CCE4;
Cell division protein ftsZ.
"Massive gene decay in the leprosy bacillus.";
-!- FUNCTION: This protein is essential to the cell-division process.
    It seems to assemble into a dynamic ring on the inner surface of
    the cytoplasmic membrane at the place where division will occur,
    and the formation of the ring is the signal for septation to
    begin. Binds to and hydrolyzes GTP (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Aggregates to form a ring-like structure (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Note=Assembles at
    the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ftsZ family.
Cell cycle; Cell division; Complete proteome; GTP-binding;
