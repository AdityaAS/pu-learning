Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (p100 co-
activator) (100 kDa coactivator) (4SNc-Tudor domain protein).
"Two variants of zebrafish p100 are expressed during embryogenesis and
regulated by Nodal signaling.";

-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: During the blastula period expressed in all
    blastomeres. At the onset of gastrulation, expressed more in the
    embryonic shield than in other regions. As embryos elongate,
    expression in the shield migrates toward the animal pole and forms
    a longitudinal band in the dorsal midline. At late gastrulation,
    expressed in the dorsal midline extending from the tailbud to the
    animal pole. Expression is under the control of Nodal signals.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 TNase-like domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Tudor domain.
Alternative splicing; Repeat.
