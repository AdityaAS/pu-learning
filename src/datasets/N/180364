AC   Q9WUA2;
Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase beta chain (EC 6.1.1.20) (Phenylalanine--
tRNA ligase beta chain) (PheRS).
"Cloning of the cDNA encoding phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase regulatory
alpha-subunit-like protein whose expression is down-regulated during
differentiation.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-phenylalanine + tRNA(Phe) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-phenylalanyl-tRNA(Phe).
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta chains (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase beta chain
    family. Type 2 subfamily.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; ATP-binding; Ligase; Nucleotide-binding;
