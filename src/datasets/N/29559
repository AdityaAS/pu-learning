AC   Q8G156;
Cobalamin synthase (EC 2.-.-.-).
"The Brucella suis genome reveals fundamental similarities between
animal and plant pathogens and symbionts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Joins Ado-cobinamide-GDP and alpha-ribazole to generate
    adenosylcobalamin (Ado-cobalamin) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: GDP-cobinamide + alpha-ribazole = cobalamin +
    GMP.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis;
    adenosylcobalamin from cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide: step 7
    [final step].
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cobS family.
