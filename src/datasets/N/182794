AC   P26636;
Seryl-tRNA synthetase, cytoplasmic (EC 6.1.1.11) (Serine--tRNA ligase)
(SerRS) (Fragment).
"A seryl-tRNA synthetase gene is coamplified with the adenylate
deaminase 2 gene in coformycin resistant Chinese hamster
fibroblasts.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-serine + tRNA(Ser) = AMP + diphosphate
    + L-seryl-tRNA(Ser).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
