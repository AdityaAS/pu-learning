AC   P81225; P81226;
Cuticle protein 21 (LM-ACP 21).
"Primary structure of two major cuticular proteins from the migratory
locust, Locusta migratoria, and their identification in polyacrylamide
gels by mass spectrometry.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the cuticle of migratory locust which
    contains more than 100 different structural proteins.
-!- DOMAIN: The tetrapeptide (A-A-P-[AV]) repeats found throughout the
    protein are also present in many proteins constituting the
    protective envelope of other species.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 chitin-binding type R&R domain.
