4-nitrophenylphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.41) (PNPPase).
"Molecular characterization of a specific p-nitrophenylphosphatase
gene, PHO13, and its mapping by chromosome fragmentation in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IV.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: PHO13 is dispensable for vegetative growth and
    sporulation.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4-nitrophenyl phosphate + H(2)O = 4-
    nitrophenol + phosphate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Activity enhanced by Mg(2+) ion but inhibited
    by Ca(2+), Zn(2+) and Be(2+) ions. Inorganic phosphate and ATP are
    competitive inhibitors, whereas pyrophosphate and AMP have no
    effect.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 2980 molecules/cell.
