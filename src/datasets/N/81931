-!- FUNCTION: May facilitate double-stranded RNA-regulated gene
    expression at the level of post-transcription. Can act as a
    translation inhibitory protein which binds to coding sequences of
    acid beta-glucosidase (GCase) and other mRNAs and functions at the
    initiation phase of GCase mRNA translation, probably by inhibiting
    its binding to polysomes. Can regulate protein arginine N-
    methyltransferase 1 activity. Can promote the formation of stable
    DNA-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complexes on DNA (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with FUS and SMN proteins and with PRMT1. Forms
    a complex with ILF2. Can also bind to PRKDC/XRCC7: this may
    stabilize the interaction of PRKDC/XRCC7 and the heterodimeric
    complex of G22P1/KU70 and XRCC5/KU80. Forms a heteromeric complex
    with ZNF346 and ILF3. Found in a nuclear export complex with XPO5,
    ILF3, Ran and double-stranded RNA or double-stranded minihelix VA1
    RNA. Found in a nuclear export complex with XPO5, RAN, ILF3,
    ZNF346 and double-stranded RNA. Interacts with XPO5 and ZNF346 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nucleolus (By similarity).
