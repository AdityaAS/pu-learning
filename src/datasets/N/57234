-!- FUNCTION: Acts as an actin bundling protein. May play a pivotal
    role in photoreceptor cell-specific events, such as disk
    morphogenesis.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Localized specifically in the outer and inner
    segments of the photoreceptor cells in the retina.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in FSCN2 are the cause of retinitis pigmentosa 30
    (RP30) [MIM:607921]. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) [MIM:268000] leads
    to degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells. Patients typically
    have night vision blindness and loss of midperipheral visual
    field. As their condition progresses, they lose their far
    peripheral visual field and eventually central vision as well.
    RP30 inheritance is autosomal dominant.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fascin family.
