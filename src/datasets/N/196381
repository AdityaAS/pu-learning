AC   Q8VDW4; Q9D5H3;
Probable ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 W (EC 6.3.2.19) (Ubiquitin-
protein ligase W) (Ubiquitin carrier protein W).
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other
    proteins (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + ubiquitin + protein lysine = AMP +
    diphosphate + protein N-ubiquityllysine.
-!- PATHWAY: Ubiquitin conjugation; second step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family.
Ligase; Ubl conjugation pathway.
