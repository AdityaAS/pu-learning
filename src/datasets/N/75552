forming N(5),N(10)-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase)
(N(5),N(10)-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin hydrogenase) (H(2)-
dependent methylene-H(4)MPT dehydrogenase).
"Hydrogen-forming and coenzyme-F420-reducing methylene
tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase are genetically distinct enzymes
in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (Marburg).";
"H2-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase, a novel
type of hydrogenase without iron-sulfur clusters in methanogenic
archaea.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reversible reduction of methenyl-
    H(4)MPT(+) to methylene-H(4)MPT.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: H(2) + 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin =
    H(+) + 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin.
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis from carbon dioxide; fourth step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HMD family.
