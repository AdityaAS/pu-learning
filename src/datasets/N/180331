tRNA ligase beta chain) (PheRS).
"Genomic sequence of an otitis media isolate of nontypeable
Haemophilus influenzae: comparative study with H. influenzae serotype
d, strain KW20.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-phenylalanine + tRNA(Phe) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-phenylalanyl-tRNA(Phe).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per tetramer (By similarity).
