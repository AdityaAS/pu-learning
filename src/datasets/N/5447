Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C (EC 4.1.2.13) (Brain-type aldolase).
"The complete amino acid sequence of the human aldolase C isozyme
derived from genomic clones.";
"The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for the human
aldolase C.";
"Characterization of the transcription-initiation site and of the
promoter region within the 5' flanking region of the human aldolase C
gene.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";

-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate = glycerone
    phosphate + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; D-glyceraldehyde 3-
    phosphate and glycerone phosphate from D-glucose: step 4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: In vertebrates, three forms of this ubiquitous
    glycolytic enzyme are found, aldolase A in muscle, aldolase B in
    liver and aldolase C in brain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class I fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
    family.
