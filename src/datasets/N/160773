AC   Q9CNJ3;
Ribosomal RNA large subunit methyltransferase J (EC 2.1.1.-) (rRNA
(uridine-2'-O-)-methyltransferase) (23S rRNA m2U2552
methyltransferase).
"Complete genomic sequence of Pasteurella multocida Pm70.";
-!- FUNCTION: Specifically methylates the uridine in position 2552 of
    23S rRNA in the fully assembled 50S ribosomal subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + rRNA = S-adenosyl-L-
    homocysteine + rRNA containing 2'-O-methyluridine.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily. RrmJ
    family.
