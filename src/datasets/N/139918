DNA repair protein RAD51 homolog 2 (AtRAD51B).
"A study of RAD51 homologues from Arabidopsis.";
"Arabidopsis Rad51B is important for double-strand DNA breaks repair
in somatic cells.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 2 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in the homologous recombination repair
    (HRR) pathway of double-stranded DNA breaks arising during DNA
    replication or induced by DNA-damaging agents (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
    Name=1; Synonyms=RAD51Balpha;
      IsoId=Q9SK02-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2; Synonyms=RAD51Bbeta;
      IsoId=Q9SK02-2; Sequence=VSP_016462, VSP_016463, VSP_016464;
    Name=3; Synonyms=RAD51Bbeta;
      IsoId=Q9SK02-3; Sequence=VSP_016465;
      Note=May be due to an intron retention. No experimental
      confirmation available. Ref.1 sequence is in conflict in
      positions: 362:PDY->FKD;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Preferentiallly expressed in flower buds and
    roots.
-!- INDUCTION: Induced by ionizing irradiation and treatment with a
    cross-linking reagent, cisplatin.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the recA family. RAD51 subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (CAD70704) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 9 and 18.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
