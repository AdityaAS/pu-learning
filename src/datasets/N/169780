AC   Q9JKD3;
Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 5 (Secretory carrier
membrane protein 5).
"Novel SCAMPs lacking NPF repeats: ubiquitous and synaptic vesicle-
specific forms implicate SCAMPs in multiple membrane-trafficking
functions.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably involved in membrane protein trafficking.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
    Cytoplasmic vesicle; secretory vesicle; synaptic vesicle; synaptic
    vesicle membrane; multi-pass membrane protein. Note=Highly
    enriched in synaptic vesicles.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain specific.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed late in development coincident with
    the elaboration of mature synapses.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SCAMP family.
