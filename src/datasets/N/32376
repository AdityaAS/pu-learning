Beta crystallin B3 (Beta-B3-crystallin).
"Homology between the primary structures of the major bovine beta-
crystallin chains.";
"Confirmation of bovine beta-B3 crystallin sequence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Crystallins are the dominant structural components of
    the vertebrate eye lens.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homo/heterodimer, or complexes of higher order. The
    structure of beta-crystallin oligomers seems to be stabilized
    through interactions between the N-terminal arms (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Has a two-domain beta-structure, folded into four very
    similar Greek key motifs.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the beta/gamma-crystallin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 beta/gamma crystallin 'Greek key' domains.
