-!- FUNCTION: Polymerizes d(-)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA to create PHB
    which consists of thousands of hydroxybutyrate molecules linked
    end to end. PHB serves as an intracellular energy reserve material
    when cells grow under conditions of nutrient limitation.
-!- PATHWAY: Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate biosynthesis; third step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Forms a biodegradable plastic that is degraded
    naturally and completely by bacteria into carbon dioxide and
    water. Utilized in the medical industry. Plates made from PHA-
    based plastics can be left in place to help heal fractured bones.
    After the bone has healed, the plastic slowly breaks down in the
    body. Utilized by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) to produce a
    PHB-PHV (poly-B-valerate) copolymer sold under the trade name
    'Biopol'. Biopol is used as packaging material. The PHB-PHV
    copolymer consists of approximately 20% PHV and 80% PHB. It can be
    synthesized by incorporating glucose and valeric acid into the
    medium. PHB-PHV is stronger and more flexible than regular PHB.
    Under industrial conditions, 80% or higher of the cell dry weight
    of A.eutrophus usually consists of the PHB-PHV copolymer.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PHA/PHB synthase family.
Acyltransferase; PHB biosynthesis; Transferase.
