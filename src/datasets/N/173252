AC   Q7TSX5;
Phosphatidylcholine:ceramide cholinephosphotransferase 1 (EC 2.7.-.-)
(Transmembrane protein 23) (Sphingomyelin synthase 1) (Mob protein).
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Bidirectional lipid cholinephosphotransferases capable
    of converting phosphatidylcholine (PC) and ceramide to
    sphingomyelin (SM) and diacylglycerol (DAG) and vice versa.
    Direction is dependent on the relative concentrations of DAG and
    ceramide as phosphocholine acceptors. Directly and specifically
    recognizes the choline head group on the substrate. Also requires
    two fatty chains on the choline-P donor molecule in order to be
    recognized efficiently as a substrate. Does not function strictly
    as a SM synthase (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sphingomyelin synthase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain.
