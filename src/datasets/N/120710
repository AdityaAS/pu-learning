Phospholipase A2 isozyme PL-Y precursor (EC 3.1.1.4)
(Phosphatidylcholine 2-acylhydrolase).
"Regional evolution of Trimeresurus flavoviridis venom-gland
phospholipase A2 isozymes.";
-!- FUNCTION: PA2 catalyzes the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of the 2-
    acyl groups in 3-sn-phosphoglycerides (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphatidylcholine + H(2)O = 1-
    acylglycerophosphocholine + a carboxylate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phospholipase A2 family. Group II
    subfamily.
