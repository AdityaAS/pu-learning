AC   Q8HYN0;
Cytochrome P450 17A1 (EC 1.14.99.9) (CYPXVII) (P450-C17) (P450c17)
(Steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase).
"Molecular evolution of adrenarche: structural and functional analysis
of p450c17 from four primate species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17-
    alpha-hydroxylated products and subsequently to
    dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. Catalyzes both
    the 17-alpha-hydroxylation and the 17,20-lyase reaction (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A steroid + AH(2) + O(2) = a 17-alpha-
    hydroxysteroid + A + H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Steroidogenic pathway; key step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome P450 family.
 GO:0004508; F:steroid 17-alpha-monooxygenase activity; IEA:EC.
