AC   P34996;
P2Y purinoceptor 1 (ATP receptor) (P2Y1) (Purinergic receptor).
"Cloning and functional expression of a brain G-protein-coupled ATP
receptor.";
"Modelling the P2Y purinoceptor using rhodopsin as template.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for extracellular adenine nucleotides such as
    ATP and ADP. Seems to mediate its action via a pertussis toxin
    insensitive G-protein, probably belonging to the Gq family that
    activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Brain, spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract,
    spleen and leg muscle. Is not detected in the heart, liver,
    stomach, lung and kidney.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
