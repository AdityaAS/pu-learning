AC   Q9RHS9;
tRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.35) (tRNA(M-5-U54)-
methyltransferase) (RUMT).
"Cloning and characterization of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATP-
binding cassette exporter, HasDEF, for the heme acquisition protein
HasA.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of 5-methyl-uridine at position
    54 (M-5-U54) in all tRNA (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA containing
    uridine at position 54 = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tRNA
    containing ribothymidine at position 54.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA M5U methyltransferase family. TrmA
    subfamily.
 GO:0006400; P:tRNA modification; IEA:HAMAP.
