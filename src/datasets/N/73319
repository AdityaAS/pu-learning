AC   Q9JKY5;
Huntingtin-interacting protein 1-related protein (Hip1-related).
"An actin-binding protein of the Sla2/Huntingtin interacting protein 1
family is a novel component of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, that may
    link the endocytic machinery to the actin cytoskeleton.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with actin and huntingtin interacting protein 1
    (HIP1). Does not interact with huntingtin (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm; perinuclear region.
    Intracytoplasmic membrane. Note=Membrane-associated protein,
    mainly localized at the endocytic compartments and in the
    perinuclear region.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Expressed at lower levels in
    skeletal muscle and heart. The level of expression does not change
    appreciably during development.
-!- DOMAIN: The talin-like domain binds F-actin.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLA2 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ENTH (epsin N-terminal homology) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 I/LWEQ domain.
