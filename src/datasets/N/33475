AC   O94454;
COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5 (EC 3.4.-.-).
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"Deletion mutants in COP9/signalosome subunits in fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe display distinct phenotypes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalytic component of the COP9 signalosome (CSN)
    complex that acts as an isopeptidase in cleaving the ubiquitin-
    like protein RUB1/NEDD8 from neddylated cullin CDC53, a SCF
    ubiquitin-ligase subunit. The complex is involved in the
    regulation of the mating pheromone response (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The JAMM motif is essential for the protease activity of
    the CSN complex resulting in deneddylation of cullins. It may
    constitute the catalytic center of the complex (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase M67A family. CSN5 subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 MPN (JAB/Mov34) domain.
