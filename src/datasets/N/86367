AC   Q43295;
Adenylyl-sulfate kinase 1, chloroplast precursor (EC 2.7.1.25) (APS
kinase) (Adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate kinase) (ATP adenosine-5'-
phosphosulfate 3'-phosphotransferase).
"A cDNA for adenylyl sulphate (APS)-kinase from Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"A cDNA clone for 5'-adenylylphosphosulfate kinase from Arabidopsis
thaliana.";

genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the synthesis of activated sulfate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + adenylyl sulfate = ADP + 3'-
    phosphoadenylyl sulfate.
-!- PATHWAY: Sulfur metabolism; hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis; sulfite
    from sulfate: step 2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the APS kinase family.
