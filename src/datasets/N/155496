AC   P00659;
Ribonuclease pancreatic (EC 3.1.27.5) (RNase 1) (RNase A).
"The amino acid sequence of topi pancreatic ribonuclease.";
-!- FUNCTION: Endonuclease that catalyzes the cleavage of RNA on the
    3' side of pyrimidine nucleotides. Acts on single stranded and
    double stranded RNA (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage to nucleoside 3'-
    phosphates and 3'-phosphooligonucleotides ending in Cp or Up with
    2',3'-cyclic phosphate intermediates.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Pancreas.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pancreatic ribonuclease family.
