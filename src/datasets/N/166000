AC   Q9RXK6;
30S ribosomal protein S7.
"Genome sequence of the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus
radiodurans R1.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly to 16S rRNA where it nucleates assembly of the head
    domain of the 30S subunit. Is located at the subunit interface
    close to the decoding center, probably blocks exit of the E-site
    tRNA (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts proteins S9
    and S11 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S7P family.
