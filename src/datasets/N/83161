Type III iodothyronine deiodinase (EC 1.97.1.11) (Type-III 5'
deiodinase) (DIOIII) (Type 3 DI) (5DIII) (XL-15).
"A thyroid hormone-regulated gene in Xenopus laevis encodes a type III
iodothyronine 5-deiodinase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the deiodination of T4 (3,5,3',5'-
    tetraiodothyronine) into RT3 (3,3',5'-triiodothyronine) and of T3
    into T2 (3,3'-diiodothyronine). May play a protective role in
    selected tissues by preventing their exposure to inappropriately
    timed or excessive levels of thyroid hormone.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine + iodide + A +
    H(+) = L-thyroxine + AH(2).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; single-pass type II membrane
    protein (By similarity). Endosome; endosomal membrane; single-pass
    type II membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the iodothyronine deiodinase family.
