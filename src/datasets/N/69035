AC   P54937;
Endoglucanase A precursor (EC 3.2.1.4) (Endo-1,4-beta-glucanase A)
(Cellulase A).
"Cloning of an endo-(1-->4)-beta-glucanase gene, celA, from the rumen
bacterium Clostridium sp. ('C. longisporum') and characterization of
its product, CelA, in Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Hydrolyzes barley beta-glucan, lichenan,
    carboxymethylcellulose and xylan. It shows preferential activity
    against the larger cellooligosaccharides (cellohexaose and
    cellopentaose); cellotetraose is the smallest substrate degraded
    completely.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic
    linkages in cellulose, lichenin and cereal beta-D-glucans.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 4.8;
    Temperature dependence:
      Optimum temperature is 43 degrees Celsius;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 5 (cellulase A)
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CBM2 (carbohydrate binding type-2) domain.
