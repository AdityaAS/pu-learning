AC   Q5HP48;
Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (EC 1.5.1.2) (P5CR) (P5C reductase).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-proline + NAD(P)(+) = 1-pyrroline-5-
    carboxylate + NAD(P)H.
-!- PATHWAY: Proline biosynthesis; third (last) step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase
    family.
