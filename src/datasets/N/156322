AC   Q87EI6;
Ribonuclease HII (EC 3.1.26.4) (RNase HII).
"Comparative analyses of the complete genome sequences of Pierce's
disease and citrus variegated chlorosis strains of Xylella
fastidiosa.";
-!- FUNCTION: Endonuclease that specifically degrades the RNA of RNA-
    DNA hybrids (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage to 5'-
    phosphomonoester.
-!- COFACTOR: Manganese or magnesium. Binds 1 divalent metal ion per
    monomer in the absence of substrate. May bind a second metal ion
    after substrate binding (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNase HII family.
