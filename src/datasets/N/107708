-!- FUNCTION: Involved in oxidative DNA damage repair. Initiates
    repair of A*oxoG to C*G by removing the inappropriately paired
    adenine base from the DNA backbone. Possesses both adenine and 2-
    OH-A DNA glycosylase activities.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster. The cluster is not important for
    the catalytic activity, but which is probably involved in the
    proper positioning of the enzyme along the DNA strand (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.

-!- DISEASE: Defects in MUTYH are a cause of gastric cancer
    [MIM:137215].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nth/mutY family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 nudix hydrolase domain.
