-!- FUNCTION: Regulator of EGFR mediated signal transduction.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with a restricted range of SH3 domain proteins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=Long;
      IsoId=Q9ULV8-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Short;
      IsoId=Q9ULV8-2; Sequence=VSP_005732;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous.
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminus is composed of the phosphotyrosine binding
    (PTB) domain, a short linker region and the RING-type zinc finger.
    The PTB domain, which is also called TKB (tyrosine kinase binding)
    domain, is composed of three different subdomains: a four-helix
    bundle (4H), a calcium-binding EF hand and a divergent SH2 domain.
-!- DOMAIN: The RING-type zinc finger domain mediates binding to an E2
    ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on tyrosines by EGFR.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein has one functional calcium-binding
    site (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CBL N-terminal domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 EF-hand-like domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RING-type zinc finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SH2 domain.
