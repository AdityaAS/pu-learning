Metallothiol transferase fosB 2 (EC 2.5.1.-) (Fosfomycin resistance
protein 2).
"The genome sequence of Bacillus anthracis Ames and comparison to
closely related bacteria.";
"Bacillus anthracis comparative genomics.";
"Complete genome sequence of Bacillus anthracis Sterne.";
-!- FUNCTION: Metallothiol transferase which confers resistance to
    fosfomycin by catalyzing the addition of a thiol cofactor to
    fosfomycin. L-cysteine is probably the physiological thiol donor
    (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fosfomycin resistance protein family.
    FosB subfamily.
