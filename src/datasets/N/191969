-!- FUNCTION: Interacts with MAPK kinases and regulates activation of
    MAP kinases. Does not display kinase activity (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Cytoplasm;
    cytoskeleton (By similarity). Note=May associate with the
    cytoskeleton (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in peripheral blood
    leukocytes.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Antibodies against TRIB2 are present in sera from
    patients with autoimmune uveitis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tribbles family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
