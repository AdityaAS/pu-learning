"The complete nucleotide sequence of the hornwort (Anthoceros
formosae) chloroplast genome: insight into the earliest land plants.";
"RNA editing in hornwort chloroplasts makes more than half the genes
functional.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to be required for the assembly of the photosystem
    I complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ycf3 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 TPR repeats.
