Major prion protein precursor (PrP) (PrP27-30) (PrP33-35C) (CD230
antigen) (Fragment).
"Evidence for an increased substitution rate of the hominoid prion
protein gene during the period of brain expansion.";
-!- FUNCTION: The function of PrP is not known. PrP is encoded in the
    host genome and is expressed both in normal and infected cells (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: PrP has a tendency to aggregate yielding polymers called
    "rods" (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; GPI-anchor (By
    similarity).
-!- DISEASE: PrP is found in high quantity in the brain of humans and
    animals infected with the degenerative neurological diseases kuru,
    Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome
    (GSS), scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),
    transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), etc.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prion family.
