AC   P07480; Q9TRN1;
Galanin precursor [Contains: Galanin; Galanin message-associated
peptide (GMAP)].
"Construction of a porcine adrenal medullary cDNA library and
nucleotide sequence analysis of two clones encoding a galanin
precursor.";
"Galanin and galanin extended at the N-terminus with seven and nine
amino acids are produced in and secreted from the porcine adrenal
medulla in almost equal amounts.";
"Galanin - a novel biologically active peptide from porcine
intestine.";
"Characterization of porcine gastric galanin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Contracts smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal and
    genitourinary tract, regulates growth hormone release, modulates
    insulin release, and may be involved in the control of adrenal
    secretion.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the galanin family.
