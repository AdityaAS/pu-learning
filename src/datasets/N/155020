AC   Q9KQH0;
Ribosomal large subunit pseudouridine synthase C (EC 5.4.99.-) (rRNA-
uridine isomerase C) (rRNA pseudouridylate synthase C).
"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for synthesis of pseudouridine from uracil
    at positions 955, 2504 and 2580 in 23S ribosomal RNA (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: rRNA uridine = rRNA pseudouridine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pseudouridine synthase rluA family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 S4 RNA-binding domain.
