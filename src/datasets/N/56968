-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in many adult tissues, with highest
    levels in kidney, pancreas and thalamus. Relatively high
    expression was also detected in fetal kidney and heart.
-!- DOMAIN: The Calx-beta domains bind calcium with high affinity and
    undergo a major conformational shift upon binding (By similarity).
-!- DISEASE: Defects in FRAS1 are a cause of Fraser syndrome
    [MIM:219000]. It is a multisystem malformation usually comprising
    cryptophthalmos, cutaneous syndactyly, ear abnormalities, renal
    agenesis and congenital heart defects.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FRAS1 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 Calx-beta domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 12 CSPG (NG2) repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 14 FU (furin-like) repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 VWFC domains.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (BAB15216) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 1858 and 1951.
