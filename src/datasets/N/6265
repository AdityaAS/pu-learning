AC   P26366;
N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase amiB precursor (EC 3.5.1.28).
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Nucleotide sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium mutL gene required
for mismatch repair: homology of MutL to HexB of Streptococcus
pneumoniae and to PMS1 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cell-wall hydrolase probably involved in cell-wall
    hydrolysis, septation or recycling.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolyzes the link between N-acetylmuramoyl
    residues and L-amino acid residues in certain cell-wall
    glycopeptides.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase 3
    family.
