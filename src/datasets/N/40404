Peptide deformylase (EC 3.5.1.88) (PDF) (Polypeptide deformylase).
"Role of mobile DNA in the evolution of vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus faecalis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Removes the formyl group from the N-terminal Met of
    newly synthesized proteins. Requires at least a dipeptide for an
    efficient rate of reaction. N-terminal L-methionine is a
    prerequisite for activity but the enzyme has broad specificity at
    other positions (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Formyl-L-methionyl peptide + H(2)O = formate +
    methionyl peptide.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 Fe(2+) ion (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the polypeptide deformylase family.
