AC   P52324;
RNA polymerase sigma factor rpoD (Sigma-70).
"A consensus promoter sequence for Caulobacter crescentus genes
involved in biosynthetic and housekeeping functions.";
"Complete genome sequence of Caulobacter crescentus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sigma factors are initiation factors that promote the
    attachment of RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites and are
    then released. This is the primary sigma factor of this bacterium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sigma-70 factor family.
