DNA topoisomerase 1 (EC 5.99.1.2) (DNA topoisomerase I).
"Identification of the gene encoding DNA topoisomerase I from Candida
albicans.";
"The topoisomerase I gene from Candida albicans.";
-!- FUNCTION: The reaction catalyzed by topoisomerases leads to the
    conversion of one topological isomer of DNA to another.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP-independent breakage of single-stranded
    DNA, followed by passage and rejoining.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Eukaryotic topoisomerase I and II can relax both
    negative and positive supercoils, whereas prokaryotic enzymes
    relax only negative supercoils.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: When a topoisomerase transiently breaks a DNA
    backbone bond, it simultaneously forms a protein-DNA link, in
    which a tyrosyl oxygen in the enzyme is joined to a DNA phosphorus
    at one end of the enzyme-severed DNA strand.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eukaryotic type I topoisomerase family.
DNA-binding; Isomerase; Topoisomerase.
