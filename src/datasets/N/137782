AC   P30786;
Polyhedrin (Major occlusion protein).
"Nucleotide sequence of the polyhedrin gene region of Helicoverpa zea
single nucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus: placement of the virus
in lepidopteran nuclear polyhedrosis virus group II.";
-!- FUNCTION: Major component of the virus occlusion bodies, which are
    large proteinaceous structures (polyhedra), that protect the virus
    from the outside environment for extended periods until they are
    ingested by insect larvae.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the polyhedrin family.
Viral occlusion body.
