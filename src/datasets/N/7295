AC   P07457; P19610;
Ice-structuring protein SP1-C precursor (ISP SP1-C) (Antifreeze
protein SP1-C).
"Structure of an antifreeze polypeptide and its precursor from the
ocean pout, Macrozoarces americanus.";
"Multiple genes provide the basis for antifreeze protein diversity and
dosage in the ocean pout, Macrozoarces americanus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Antifreeze proteins lower the blood freezing point by
    absorbing ice and inhibiting its growth.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type-III AFP family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 AFP-like domain.
