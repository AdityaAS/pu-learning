Colipase (Fragment).
"Purification and characterization of pancreatic colipase from the
dogfish (Squalus acanthius).";
-!- FUNCTION: Colipase is a cofactor of pancreatic lipase. It allows
    the lipase to anchor itself to the lipid-water interface. Without
    colipase the enzyme is washed off by bile salts, which have an
    inhibitory effect on the lipase.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with pancreatic
    lipase.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the pancreas.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the colipase family.
Digestion; Direct protein sequencing; Lipid degradation.
