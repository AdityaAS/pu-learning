AC   P93395;
Proteasome subunit beta type 6 precursor (EC 3.4.25.1) (Proteasome
delta chain) (Tobacco cryptogein-induced protein 7) (tcI 7).
"Cloning of two plant cDNAs encoding a beta-type proteasome subunit
and a transformer-2-like SR-related protein: early induction of the
corresponding genes in tobacco cells treated with cryptogein.";
"Induction of tcI 7, a gene encoding a beta-subunit of proteasome, in
tobacco plants treated with elicitins, salicylic acid or hydrogen
peroxide.";
-!- FUNCTION: The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex
    which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg,
    Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or
    slightly basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic
    activity.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cleavage of peptide bonds with very broad
    specificity.
-!- SUBUNIT: The proteasome is composed of at least 15 non identical
    subunits which form a highly ordered ring-shaped structure.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: Up-regulated by elicitins (cryptogein and
    parasiticein), salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase T1B family.
