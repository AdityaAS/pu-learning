AC   Q58DH8; Q3MHF6; Q58DS0;
Flap endonuclease 1 (EC 3.1.-.-) (Flap structure-specific endonuclease
1) (FEN-1).
"Characterization of 954 bovine full-CDS cDNA sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: Endonuclease that cleaves the 5' overhanging flap
    structure that is generated by displacement synthesis when DNA
    polymerase encounters the 5' end of a downstream Okazaki fragment.
    It fails to cleave other DNA structures, including 3' flaps and
    single stranded DNA (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PCNA. The C-terminal domain binds EP300.
    Can bind simultaneously to both PCNA and EP300 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Acetylated by EP300. Acetylation inhibits both endonuclease
    and exonuclease activity, and reduces the DNA-binding activity but
    does not affect interaction with PCNA or EP300 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the XPG/RAD2 endonuclease family. FEN1
    subfamily.
Acetylation; Endonuclease; Hydrolase; Nuclear protein; Nuclease.
