DNA-binding protein 7d (7 kDa DNA-binding protein d) (Sac7d)
[Contains: DNA-binding protein 7a (7 kDa DNA-binding protein a)
(Sac7a); DNA-binding protein 7b (7 kDa DNA-binding protein b)
(Sac7b)].
"Gene cloning, expression, and characterization of the Sac7 proteins
from the hyperthermophile Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.";
"The genome of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, a model organism of the
Crenarchaeota.";
"The amino acid sequence of a small DNA binding protein from the
archaebacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus.";
"Microsequence analysis of DNA-binding proteins 7a, 7b, and 7e from
the archaebacterium Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.";
"Solution structure of the DNA-binding protein Sac7d from the
hyperthermophile Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.";

-!- FUNCTION: Constrain negative DNA supercoils; may be involved in
    maintaining the integrity of their genome at high temperature.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- PTM: Lys-4 was 70% monomethylated in form 7a, 25% in form 7b, and
    20% in form 7d. Lys-6 was 50% monomethylated in form 7a, 40% in
    form 7b, and 50% in form 7d.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 7 kDa DNA-binding/endoribonuclease P2
    family.
3D-structure; Complete proteome; Direct protein sequencing;
