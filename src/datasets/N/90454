-!- FUNCTION: Required for polarization of the embryonic, imaginal
    disk and follicular epithelia. Specifically restricts apical
    membrane determinants to the apical cell surface; acts to exclude
    crb from the basolateral domain and define adherens junction
    position. Regulates cellular growth and differentiation; acts as a
    tumor suppressor. Essential for odor guided behavior.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Cell membrane; peripheral
    membrane protein. Note=Localized to epithelial septate junction at
    the boundary of the apical and basolateral cell surfaces.

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: During germ band extension, expression of
    isoform A occurs predominantly in neuroblasts derived from the
    neuro-ectoderm and later is restricted to CNS neurons and pole
    cells. Isoform C is strongly expressed in PNS and a subset of CNS
    neurons. In the adult, expressed in third antennal segment and
    maxillary palps, major olfactory organs and in Johnstons organ in
    the second antennal segment. Expression is also observed in
    cortical regions of the brain. Isoforms expressed in epithelia are
    coexpressed with dlg1 throughout development.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed both zygotically and maternally in
    embryos. Isoform A and isoform C have high expression throughout
    embryonic development and very low expression in later
    developmental stages. In adults, isoform A is a male-specific
    isoform and isoform C a female specific.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Mutants exhibit aberrant cell shape and loss of the
    monolayer organization of embryonic epithelia creating a
    corrugated cuticular surface that is riddled with holes hence the
    gene name scribble. Misdistribution of apical proteins and
    adherens junctions to the basolateral cell surface is also
    exhibited.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the LAP (LRR and PDZ) protein family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 15 LRR (leucine-rich) repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 PDZ (DHR) domains.
