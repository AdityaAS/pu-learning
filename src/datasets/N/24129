AC   Q43056;
Chalcone--flavonone isomerase (EC 5.5.1.6) (Chalcone isomerase).
"Cloning of chalcone-flavanone isomerase cDNA from Pueraria lobata and
its overexpression in Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for the isomerization of 4,2',4',6'-
    tetrahydroxychalcone (also termed chalcone) into naringenin.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A chalcone = a flavanone.
-!- PATHWAY: Secondary metabolite biosynthesis; flavonoid
    biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the chalcone isomerase family.
