-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-cystathionine + H(2)O = L-cysteine + NH(3) +
    2-oxobutanoate.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-cysteine biosynthesis; L-
    cysteine from L-serine: step 2 [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=P32929-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=P32929-2; Sequence=VSP_006306;
-!- DISEASE: Defects in CTH are the cause of cystathioninuria
    [MIM:219500]. CTH is an autosomal recessive phenotype
    characterized by abnormal accumulation of plasma cystathionine,
    leading to increased urinary excretion.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the trans-sulfuration enzymes family.
