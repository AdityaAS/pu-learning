-!- FUNCTION: It is thought to provide protection for the cytoplasm
    during the desiccation stage of embryo development.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed principally in the later stages of
    embryogenesis prior to dehydration of the grain.
-!- INDUCTION: By abscisic acid (ABA) and osmotic stress.
