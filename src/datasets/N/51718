Exostosin-1a (EC 2.4.1.224) (EC 2.4.1.225) (Glucuronosyl-N-
acetylglucosaminyl-proteoglycan/N-acetylglucosaminyl-proteoglycan 4-
alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1a) (Multiple exostoses protein
1 homolog a).
"Distinct tissue-specificity of three zebrafish ext1 genes encoding
proteoglycan modifying enzymes and their relationship to somitic Sonic
hedgehog signaling.";
-!- FUNCTION: Glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of
    heparan-sulfate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + beta-D-
    glucuronosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-proteoglycan =
    UDP + N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucuronosyl-
    (1->4)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-proteoglycan.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-alpha-D-glucuronate + N-acetyl-alpha-D-
    glucosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucuronosyl-proteoglycan = UDP + beta-
    D-glucuronosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-
    glucuronosyl-proteoglycan.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycosylation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; single-pass type II membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed both maternally and zygotically.
    During gastrulation, expressed in the neuroectoderm. At the 3-
    somite stage, expressed in the prospective forebrain, hindbrain
    and tailbud. From the 5-somite stage, expressed in the somitic
    mesoderm. At the 16-somite stage, also expressed in the dorsal
    neural tube, the eye and the Kupffer's vesicle. At 48 hours-post-
    fertilization (hpf), expression continues in the dorsal
    diencephalon and cerebellum and is observed in the otic vesicle.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 47 family.
