AC   O18835;
Beta-glucuronidase precursor (EC 3.2.1.31).
"Cloning of the canine beta-glucuronidase cDNA, mutation
identification in canine MPS VII, and retroviral vector-mediated
correction of MPS VII cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays an important role in the degradation of dermatan
    and keratan sulfates (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A beta-D-glucuronoside + H(2)O = D-glucuronate
    + an alcohol.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Lysosome.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in GUSB are the cause of mucopolysaccharidosis
    type VII (MPS VII), an inherited disease reported in humans, mice,
    cats, and dogs.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 2 family.
