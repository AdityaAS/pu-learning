AC   Q8BUJ9; Q8BWM9;
Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 12 precursor.
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable receptor, which may be involved in the
    internalization of lipophilic molecules and/or signal
    transduction. May act as a tumor suppressor (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: May interact with GNB2L1, MADHIP and ITGB1BP3 (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q8BUJ9-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q8BUJ9-2; Sequence=VSP_009821;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the LDLR family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 CUB domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 LDL-receptor class A domains.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (BAC39247) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 854 and to wrong initiation.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (BAC39247) sequence differs from that shown due to
    wrong initiation.
