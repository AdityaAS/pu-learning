AC   Q9RRM7;
Histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.9) (Imidazole acetol-
phosphate transaminase).
"Genome sequence of the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus
radiodurans R1.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-histidinol phosphate + 2-oxoglutarate = 3-
    (imidazol-4-yl)-2-oxopropyl phosphate + L-glutamate.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-histidine biosynthesis; L-
    histidine from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate: step 7.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
    aminotransferase family. Histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase
    subfamily.
