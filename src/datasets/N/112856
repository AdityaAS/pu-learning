AC   Q6FNL3;
H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex subunit 3 (Nucleolar protein family A
member 3) (snoRNP protein NOP10).
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for ribosome biogenesis. Part of a complex
    which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA. This involves the
    isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently
    attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Pseudouridine ("psi")
    residues may serve to stabilize the conformation of rRNAs (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein
    particles containing H/ACA-type snoRNAs (H/ACA snoRNPs) (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nucleolus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NOP10 family.
