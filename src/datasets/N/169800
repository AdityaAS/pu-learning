Sister chromatid cohesion 1 protein 2 (SCC1 homolog 2) (AtRAD21-1).
"Cloning and characterization of two Arabidopsis genes that belong to
the RAD21/REC8 family of chromosome cohesin proteins.";
"Functional analysis of the three Arabidopsis RAD21 homologs.";
"Structural analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 5. V. Sequence
features of the regions of 1,381,565 bp covered by twenty one
physically assigned P1 and TAC clones.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in sister chromatid cohesion during
    mitosis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the cohesin complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q9FQ20-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q9FQ20-2; Sequence=VSP_007493;
      Note=Intron 9 uses an acceptor splice site 3 nucleotides
      downstream of the one used in isoform 1;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Low expression in shoots, buds, siliques,
    leaves and roots. Found in, but not limitted to, actively dividing
    cells: in procambium, protoderm and ground meristem in roots, and
    in shoot and floral meristems.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the rad21 family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
