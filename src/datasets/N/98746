AC   P11561;
Methyl-coenzyme M reductase subunit beta (EC 2.8.4.1) (Coenzyme-B
sulfoethylthiotransferase beta).
"Comparative analysis of genes encoding methyl coenzyme M reductase in
methanogenic bacteria.";
-!- FUNCTION: Reduction of methyl-coenzyme M (2-(methylthio)
    ethanesulfonic acid) with 7-mercaptoheptanoylthreonine phosphate
    to methane and an heterodisulfide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonate (methyl-CoM) +
    N-(7-mercaptoheptanoyl)threonine 3-O-phosphate (coenzyme B) = CoM-
    S-S-CoB + methane.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 coenzyme F430 noncovalently per hexamer.
    Coenzyme F430 is a yellow nickel porphinoid (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Methanogenesis; last step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Hexamer of two alpha, two beta, and two gamma chains.
