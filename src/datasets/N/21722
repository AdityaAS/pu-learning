CCA-adding enzyme (EC 2.7.7.25) (EC 2.7.7.21) (tRNA
nucleotidyltransferase) (tRNA adenylyl-/cytidylyl- transferase) (tRNA
CCA-pyrophosphorylase) (tRNA-NT).
"Genome sequence of a serotype M3 strain of group A Streptococcus:
phage-encoded toxins, the high-virulence phenotype, and clone
emergence.";

large-scale genomic rearrangement in invasive strains and new insights
into phage evolution.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the addition and repair of the essential 3'-
    terminal CCA sequence in tRNAs without using a nucleic acid
    template. Adds these three nucleotides in the order of C, C, and A
    to the tRNA nucleotide-73, using CTP and ATP as substrates and
    producing inorganic pyrophosphate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + tRNA(n) = diphosphate + tRNA(n+1).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CTP + tRNA(n) = diphosphate + tRNA(n+1).
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: A single active site specifically recognizes both
    ATP and CTP and is responsible for their addition (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tRNA nucleotidyltransferase/poly(A)
    polymerase family. Bacterial CCA-adding enzyme type 3 subfamily.
