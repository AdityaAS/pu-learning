AC   P61338;
Elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts).
"Complete genome sequence of the metabolically versatile
photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris.";
-!- FUNCTION: Associates with the EF-Tu.GDP complex and induces the
    exchange of GDP to GTP. It remains bound to the aminoacyl-tRNA.EF-
    Tu.GTP complex up to the GTP hydrolysis stage on the ribosome.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the EF-Ts family.
