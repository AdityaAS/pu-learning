Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E type 2 (eIF4E type 2)
(eIF-4E type 2) (mRNA cap-binding protein type 2) (eIF4E-2)
(Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-like 3) (eIF4E-like
protein 4E-LP).
"Characterization of mammalian eIF4E-family members.";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine-containing
    mRNA cap during an early step in the initiation of protein
    synthesis and facilitates ribosome binding by inducing the
    unwinding of the mRNAs secondary structures.
-!- SUBUNIT: eIF4F is a multi-subunit complex, the composition of
    which varies with external and internal environmental conditions.
    It is composed of at least eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4G. eIF4E is also
    known to interact with other partners (By similarity). EIF4E2
    interacts with EIF4EBP1, EIF4EBP2 and EIF4EBP3 but not with eIF4G.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q04637:EIF4G1 (xeno); NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-398682, EBI-73711;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed with highest levels in
    testis, kidney and liver.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E family.
