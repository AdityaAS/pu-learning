"Characterization of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase from the bathophile
fish, Lampanyctus crocodilus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Destroys radicals which are normally produced within the
    cells and which are toxic to biological systems.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 superoxide + 2 H(+) = O(2) + H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 copper ion per subunit.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase family.
