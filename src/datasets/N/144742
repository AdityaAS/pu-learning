AC   Q9Y7U6;
Rho1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1.
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"Rho1-GEFs Rgf1 and Rgf2 are involved in formation of cell wall and
septum, while Rgf3 is involved in cytokinesis in fission yeast.";
"Cell wall remodeling at the fission yeast cell division site requires
the Rho-GEF Rgf3p.";
"Rgf1p is a specific Rho1-GEF that coordinates cell polarization with
cell wall biogenesis in fission yeast.";
"ORFeome cloning and global analysis of protein localization in the
fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: Stimulates the exchange of Rho1 and Rho5 GDP-bound form
    into GTP-bound form. Controls septum formation, cell wall
    synthesis and localization of F-actin patches. Coordinates actin
    deposition with cell wall biosynthesis during bipolar growth.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Note=Septum. Localizes to cell
    tips during interphase and the septum in mitotic cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CNH domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DH (DBL-homology) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PH domain.
