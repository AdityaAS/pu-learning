-!- FUNCTION: Putative neuronal cell surface protein involved in cell-
    cell-interactions.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts through its C-terminus with DLG4/PSD-95 third
    PDZ domain.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q8N0W4-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q8N0W4-2; Sequence=VSP_013270;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed at highest levels in heart.
    Expressed at lower levels in liver, skeletal muscle and pancreas
    and at very low levels in brain.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in NLGN4X may be the cause of susceptibility to
    X-linked autism 2 (AUTSX2) [MIM:300495]. AUTSX2 is a pervasive
    developmental disorder (PDD), prototypically characterized by
    impairments in reciprocal social interaction and communication,
    restricted and stereotyped patterns of interests and activities,
    and the presence of developmental abnormalities by 3 years of age.
-!- DISEASE: Defects in NLGN4X may be the cause of susceptibility to
    X-linked Asperger syndrome 2 (ASPGX2) [MIM:300497]. ASPGX2 is
    considered to be a form of childhood autism.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type-B carboxylesterase/lipase family.
