AC   P68290; P51498;
Interleukin-2 precursor (IL-2) (T-cell growth factor) (TCGF).
"Comparative sequence analysis of cytokine genes from human and
nonhuman primates.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produced by T-cells in response to antigenic or
    mitogenic stimulation, this protein is required for T-cell
    proliferation and other activities crucial to regulation of the
    immune response. Can stimulate B-cells, monocytes, lymphokine-
    activated killer cells, natural killer cells, and glioma cells (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IL-2 family.
