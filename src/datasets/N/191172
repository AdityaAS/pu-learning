Tropomyosin (MOv-14) (Ov-tmy-1).
"Tropomyosin implicated in host protective responses to microfilariae
in onchocerciasis.";
"Protective immunity induced by vaccination with Onchocerca volvulus
tropomyosin in rodents.";
-!- FUNCTION: Tropomyosin, in association with the troponin complex,
    plays a central role in the calcium dependent regulation of muscle
    contraction.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Present in all life-cycle stages.
-!- DOMAIN: The molecule is in a coiled coil structure that is formed
    by 2 polypeptide chains. The sequence exhibits a prominent seven-
    residues periodicity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tropomyosin family.
