AC   Q9JK42;
[Pyruvate dehydrogenase [lipoamide]] kinase isozyme 2, mitochondrial
precursor (EC 2.7.11.2) (Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2).
"Mus musculus pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 cDNA.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase
    complex by phosphorylation of the E1 alpha subunit, thus
    contributing to the regulation of glucose metabolism.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + [pyruvate dehydrogenase (acetyl-
    transferring)] = ADP + [pyruvate dehydrogenase (acetyl-
    transferring)] phosphate.
-!- INTERACTION:
    O08908:Pik3r2; NbExp=2; IntAct=EBI-643530, EBI-643570;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial matrix.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PDK/BCKDK protein kinase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 histidine kinase domain.
 GO:0005515; F:protein binding; IPI:IntAct.
