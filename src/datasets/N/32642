AC   Q9HFS2;
DNA-binding protein creA (Carbon catabolite repressor).
"Isolation of the carbon catabolite repressor (CREA) gene from the
plant-pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in carbon catabolite repression. Represses the
    transcription of a number of genes by binding to a GC-rich region
    in their promoter (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the creA/MIG C2H2-type zinc-finger protein
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 C2H2-type zinc fingers.
