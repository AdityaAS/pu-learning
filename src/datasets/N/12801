AC   Q3IR98;
7-cyano-7-deazaguanine tRNA-ribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.-) (Archaeal
tRNA-guanine transglycosylase).
"Living with two extremes: conclusions from the genome sequence of
Natronomonas pharaonis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Exchanges the guanine residue with 7-cyano-7-
    deazaguanine (preQ0) at position 15 in the dihydrouridine loop (D-
    loop) of archaeal tRNAs (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: tRNA guanine + 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine = tRNA
    7-cyano-7-deazaguanine + guanine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleoside biosynthesis; archaeosine biosynthesis;
    archaeosine-tRNA from GTP; step 2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the archaeosine tRNA-ribosyltransferase
    family.
