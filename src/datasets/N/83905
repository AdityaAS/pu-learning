AC   Q7VMA9;
Cysteine desulfurase (EC 2.8.1.7).
"The complete genome sequence of Haemophilus ducreyi.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the removal of elemental sulfur from cysteine
    to produce alanine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-cysteine + [enzyme]-cysteine = L-alanine +
    [enzyme]-S-sulfanylcysteine.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-V pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
    aminotransferase family. NifS/iscS subfamily.
Complete proteome; Pyridoxal phosphate; Transferase.
