-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair.
    Binds double-stranded DNA in a sequence-nonspecific manner. Acts
    as a structural component of the nuclear framework. May also serve
    as a support for spliceosome binding and activity. Essential for
    spliceosome assembly in a oligomerization-dependent manner and
    might also be important for spliceosome stability. May have E3
    ubiquitin ligase activity. The PSO4 complex is required in the DNA
    interstrand cross-links (ICLs) repair process (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homooligomer. Identified in the spliceosome C complex, at
    least composed of AQR, ASCC3L1, C19orf29, CDC40, CDC5L, CRNKL1,

    ZCCHC8. Component of the PSO4 complex, composed of PRPF19, CDC5L,
    PLRG1. Interacts with DNTT/TdT and PSMB4 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity). Nucleus;
    nucleoplasm (By similarity). Note=Nucleoplasmic in interphase
    cells. Irregularly distributed in anaphase cells. In prophase
    cells, uniformly distributed, but not associated with condensing
    chromosomes. Found in extrachromosomal regions in metaphase cells.
    Mainly localized to the mitotic spindle apparatus when chromosomes
    segregate during anaphase. When nuclei reform during late
    telophase, uniformly distributed in daughter cells and displays no
    preferred association with decondensing chromatin (By similarity).
