Chlorophyll a-b binding protein 1, chloroplast precursor (LHCII type I
CAB-1) (LHCP).
"Nucleotide sequences of two genes encoding the light harvesting
chlorophyll a/b binding protein of rice.";
"Classification and characterization of cDNA that encodes the light-
harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein of photosystem II from
rice.";

"Collection, mapping, and annotation of over 28,000 cDNA clones from
japonica rice.";
-!- FUNCTION: The light-harvesting complex (LHC) functions as a light
    receptor, it captures and delivers excitation energy to
    photosystems with which it is closely associated.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds at least 14 chlorophylls (8 Chl-a and 6 Chl-b) and
    carotenoids such as lutein and neoxanthin (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The LHC complex consists of chlorophyll a-b binding
    proteins.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminus of the protein extends into the stroma
    where it is involved with adhesion of granal membranes and post-
    translational modifications; both are believed to mediate the
    distribution of excitation energy between photosystems I and II.
-!- PTM: Photoregulated by reversible phosphorylation of its threonine
    residues (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-
    binding (LHC) protein family.
