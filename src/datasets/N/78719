Homeobox protein Hox-D13 (Hox-4.8).
"Function of the Evx-2 gene in the morphogenesis of vertebrate
limbs.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The Hox-4.8 gene is localized at the 5' extremity of the Hox-4
complex and is expressed in the most posterior parts of the body
during development.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sequence-specific transcription factor which is part of
    a developmental regulatory system that provides cells with
    specific positional identities on the anterior-posterior axis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Abd-B homeobox family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 homeobox DNA-binding domain.
