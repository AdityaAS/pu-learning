AC   P83627;
Vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone (VIH).
"Isolation and amino acid sequence of a peptide with vitellogenesis
inhibiting activity from the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare
(Crustacea).";
"Localization of crustacean hyperglycemic and vitellogenesis-
inhibiting hormones in separate cell types in the protocerebrum of the
woodlouse Armadillidium vulgare (Crustacea, Isopoda).";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits secondary vitellogenesis in females. Has no
    hyperglycemic or molt-inhibiting activity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found in the sinus glands of both male and
    female. Found also in the brain; the neuroendocrine structures of
    the protocerebrum.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=9485; METHOD=Electrospray; RANGE=1-83;
    NOTE=Ref.1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the arthropod CHH/MIH/GIH/VIH hormone
    family.
