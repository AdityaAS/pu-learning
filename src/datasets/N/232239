AC   Q62384;
Zinc-finger protein ZPR1 (Zinc finger protein 259).
"Binding of zinc finger protein ZPR1 to the epidermal growth factor
receptor.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The cytoplasmic zinc finger protein ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus
of proliferating cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be a signaling molecule that communicates mitogenic
    signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of an import snRNP complex composed of KPNB1,
    SNUPN, SMN1 and ZNF259 (By similarity). Binds to the EGF and PDGF
    receptors. Binds to the elongation factor 1-alpha.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Note=Translocates to the
    nucleus after treatment with mitogens.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ZPR1 family.
