AC   Q8EPP3;
Probable septum site-determining protein minC.
"Genome sequence of Oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from the Iheya
Ridge and its unexpected adaptive capabilities to extreme
environments.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cell division inhibitor that blocks the formation of
    polar Z ring septums. Rapidly oscillates between the poles of the
    cell to destabilize ftsZ filaments that have formed before they
    mature into polar Z rings. Prevent ftsZ polymerization (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with minD and ftsZ (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the minC family.
