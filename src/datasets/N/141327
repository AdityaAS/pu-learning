AC   P48685;
Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain precursor (EC 4.1.1.39)
(RuBisCO large subunit).
"Phylogenetic analysis of green plant rbcL sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: RuBisCO catalyzes two reactions: the carboxylation of D-
    ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, the primary event in carbon dioxide
    fixation, as well as the oxidative fragmentation of the pentose
    substrate in the photorespiration process. Both reactions occur
    simultaneously and in competition at the same active site (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate + CO(2) + H(2)O =
    2 3-phospho-D-glycerate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate + O(2) = 3-
    phospho-D-glycerate + 2-phosphoglycolate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 magnesium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterohexadecamer of 8 large chains and 8 small chains
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The basic functional RuBisCO is composed of a large
    chain homodimer in a "head-to-tail" conformation. In form I
    RuBisCO this homodimer is arranged in a barrel-like tetramer with
    the small subunits forming a tetrameric "cap" on each end of the
    "barrel" (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RuBisCO large chain family. Type I
    subfamily.
