AC   Q9SMJ3;
Zeta-carotene desaturase, chloroplast precursor (EC 1.14.99.30)
(Carotene 7,8-desaturase).
"Molecular cloning and functional expression in E. coli of a novel
plant enzyme mediating zeta-carotene desaturation.";
"Catalytic properties of an expressed and purified higher plant type
zeta-carotene desaturase from Capsicum annuum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the conversion of zeta-carotene to lycopene
    via the intermediary of neurosporene. It carries out two
    consecutive desaturations (introduction of double bonds) at
    positions C-7 and C-7'.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Neurosporene + AH(2) + O(2) = lycopene + A + 2
    H(2)O.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Zeta-carotene + AH(2) + O(2) = neurosporene +
    A + 2 H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: NAD, NADP, or FAD (Probable).
-!- PATHWAY: Carotenoid biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast. Plastid; chromoplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the zeta carotene desaturase family.
