-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the oxidation of mono- and o-diphenols to o-
    diquinones.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 catechol + O(2) = 2 1,2-benzoquinone + 2
    H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 copper ions per subunit.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by phenylthiourea.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    lumen (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tyrosinase family.
