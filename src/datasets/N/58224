3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase precursor (EC 1.1.1.102) (3-
dehydrosphinganine reductase) (KDS reductase) (Follicular variant
translocation protein 1) (FVT-1).
"FVT-1, a novel human transcription unit affected by variant
translocation t(2;18)(p11;q21) of follicular lymphoma.";
"Cloning of human full-length CDSs in BD Creator(TM) system donor
vector.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"FVT-1 is a mammalian 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase with an
active site that faces the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum
membrane.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reduction of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine
    (KDS) to dihydrosphingosine (DHS).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Sphinganine + NADP(+) = 3-dehydrosphinganine +
    NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Lipid metabolism; sphingolipid metabolism.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in all tissues examined. Highest
    expression in placenta. High expression in lung, kidney, stomach
    and small intestine, low expression in heart, spleen and skeletal
    muscle. Weakly expressed in normal hematopoietic tissues. Higher
    expression in some T-cell malignancies and PHA-stimulated
    lymphocytes.
-!- DISEASE: A chromosomal aberration involving FVT1 is a cause of
    follicular lymphoma; also known as type II chronic lymphatic
    leukemia. Translocation t(2;18)(p11;q21) with a Ig J kappa chain
    region.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases
    (SDR) family.
