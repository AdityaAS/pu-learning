AC   Q9HMD2;
Glutamine amidotransferase subunit pdxT (EC 2.6.-.-) (Glutamine
amidotransferase glutaminase subunit pdxT).
"Genome sequence of Halobacterium species NRC-1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate and
    ammonia. Channels an ammonia molecule to pdxS (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; pyridoxal 5'-phosphate
    biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a complex with pdxS (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glutamine amidotransferase pdxT/SNO
    family.
