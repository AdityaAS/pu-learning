kinase (UDP-GlcNAc-2-epimerase/ManAc kinase) [Includes: UDP-N-
acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.14) (Uridine diphosphate-N-
acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase) (UDP-GlcNAc-2-epimerase); N-

-!- FUNCTION: Regulates and initiates biosynthesis of N-
    acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc), a precursor of sialic acids.
    Required for normal sialylation in hematopoietic cells (By
    similarity). Sialylation is implicated in cell adhesion, signal
    transduction, tumorigenicity and metastatic behavior of malignant
    cells. Plays an essential role in early development.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine = UDP-N-acetyl-D-
    mannosamine.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + N-acetyl-D-mannosamine = ADP + N-acetyl-
    D-mannosamine 6-phosphate.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Allosterically regulated; feedback inhibited by
    cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac), the
    end product of neuraminic acid biosynthesis. Activity is dependent
    on oligomerization. The monomer is inactive, whereas the dimer
    catalyzes only the phosphorylation of N-acetylmannosamine; the
    hexamer is fully active for both enzyme activities (By
    similarity). Up-regulated after PKC-dependent phosphorylation.
-!- PATHWAY: N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) biosynthetic pathway;
    first step.
-!- PATHWAY: N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) biosynthetic pathway;
    second step.
-!- PATHWAY: N-acetylmannosamine utilization.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer and homohexamer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Highest expression in liver.
    Also found at high levels in lung, brain and kidney.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: In the embryo, expressed at day E7, E11 and
    E15.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by PKC.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the UDP-N-
    acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the ROK
    (nagC/xylR) family.
