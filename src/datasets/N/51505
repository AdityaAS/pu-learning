AC   Q875R9;
Glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase precursor (EC 3.2.1.58) (Exo-1,3-beta-
glucanase).
"Yeast genome duplication was followed by asynchronous differentiation
of duplicated genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Beta-glucanases participate in the metabolism of beta-
    glucan, the main structural component of the cell wall. It could
    also function biosynthetically as a transglycosylase (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Successive hydrolysis of beta-D-glucose units
    from the non-reducing ends of 1,3-beta-D-glucans, releasing alpha-
    glucose.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 5 (cellulase A)
    family.
