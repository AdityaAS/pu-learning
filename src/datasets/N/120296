Cellular tumor antigen p53 (Tumor suppressor p53).
"cDNA cloning and expression analysis of flounder p53 tumour
suppressor gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces
    growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological
    circumstances and cell type. Involved in cell cycle regulation as
    a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division
    by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of
    the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases.
    Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of
    BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2
    expression (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds DNA as a homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the p53 family.
