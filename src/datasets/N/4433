AC   P24483;
Adrenodoxin, mitochondrial precursor (Adrenal ferredoxin) (Ferredoxin-
1).
"Expression and regulation of adrenodoxin and P450scc mRNA in rodent
tissues.";
"Cloning and sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA of rat
adrenodoxin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Adrenodoxin transfers electrons from adrenodoxin
    reductase to the cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial matrix.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found in all tissues, most abundant in
    adrenals, ovaries and testes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adrenodoxin/putidaredoxin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain.
