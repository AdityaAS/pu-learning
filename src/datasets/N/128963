AC   Q04544;
Non-structural polyprotein [Contains: p48; Helicase (2C-like protein)
(P2C); 3A-like protein; Viral genome-linked protein (VPg); Thiol
protease P3C (EC 3.4.22.-) (3C-like protease) (3C-pro); RNA-directed
RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.48)].
"Sequence and genome organization of a human small round-structured
(Norwalk-like) virus.";
"A conserved sequence motif at the 5' terminus of the Southampton
virus genome is characteristic of the Caliciviridae.";
"Identification of further proteolytic cleavage sites in the
Southampton calicivirus polyprotein by expression of the viral
protease in E. coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: P2C is important in RNA replication (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: The cysteine protease is the protease responsible for
    the post-translational processing of the polypeptide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- PTM: Specific enzymatic cleavages by its own cysteine protease
    yield mature proteins. The protease cleaves itself from the
    nascent polyprotein autocatalytically (By similarity).
-!- PTM: VPg is covalently attached to the 5'-end of the genomic RNA
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase C37 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RdRp catalytic domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SF3 helicase domain.
