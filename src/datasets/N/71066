AC   P68058; P02079;
Hemoglobin subunit beta-C (Hemoglobin beta-C chain) (Beta-C-globin).
"Production of hemoglobin C in the Moufflon (Ovis musimon Pallas,
1811) and the Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia Pallas, 1777) during
experimental anemia: amino acid composition of tryptic peptides from
the beta B and beta C chains.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in oxygen transport from the lung to the
    various peripheral tissues.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer of two alpha chains and two beta chains.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Red blood cells.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This type of beta-C chain is found in these animals
    when anemia has been experimentally produced.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the globin family.
