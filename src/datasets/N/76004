AC   Q9Z2X5;
Homer protein homolog 3 (Homer-3) (VASP/Ena-related gene up-regulated
during seizure and LTP 3) (Vesl-3).
"Rattus norvegicus mRNA for Vesl-3, complete cds.";
-!- FUNCTION: Postsynaptic density scaffolding protein. Binds and
    cross-links cytoplasmic regions of GRM1, GRM5, ITPR1, DNM3, RYR1,
    RYR2, SHANK1 and SHANK3. By physically linking GRM1 and GRM5 with
    ER-associated ITPR1 receptors it aids the coupling of surface
    receptors to intracellular calcium release (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Encodes coiled-coil structures that mediate homo- and
    heteromultimerization (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Note=Postsynaptic
    density of neuronal cells (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The WH1 domain interacts with the PPXXF motif in GRM1,
    GRM5, RYR1, RYR2, ITPR1, SHANK 1 and SHANK3.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Homer family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 WH1 domain.
