receptor) (Melanocortin receptor 1) (MC1-R).
"Evolution of a pigmentation gene, the melanocortin-1 receptor, in
primates.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for MSH (alpha, beta and gamma) and ACTH. The
    activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate
    adenylate cyclase (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
