AC   Q7VAG9;
PsbF-like protein.
"Genome sequence of the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus SS120,
a nearly minimal oxyphototrophic genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Unknown. Resembles psbF, one of the subunits of the
    photosystem II reaction center. However is encodes asparagine
    rather than histidine at the site psbF uses to bind heme.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the psbE/psbF family.
Complete proteome; Membrane; Transmembrane.
