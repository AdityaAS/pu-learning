AC   Q66I46;
MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (EC 2.7.11.1)
(MAP kinase signal-integrating kinase 2) (Mnk2).
-!- FUNCTION: May play a role in the response to environmental stress
    and cytokines. Appears to regulate transcription by
    phosphorylating EIF4E, thus increasing the affinity of this
    protein for the 7-methylguanosine-containing mRNA cap (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
