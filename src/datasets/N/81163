AC   Q865X1;
Interferon gamma precursor (IFN-gamma).
"Cloning and sequence analysis of llama cytokines related to cell-
mediated immunity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produced by lymphocytes activated by specific antigens
    or mitogens. IFN-gamma, in addition to having antiviral activity,
    has important immunoregulatory functions. It is a potent activator
    of macrophages, it has antiproliferative effects on transformed
    cells and it can potentiate the antiviral and antitumor effects of
    the type I interferons (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Released primarily from activated T
    lymphocytes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the type II (or gamma) interferon family.
