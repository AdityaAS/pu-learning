AC   Q71YB3;
3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.11)
(Ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase).
"Whole genome comparisons of serotype 4b and 1/2a strains of the food-
borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes reveal new insights into the
core genome components of this species.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + 3-methyl-2-
    oxobutanoate + H(2)O = tetrahydrofolate + 2-dehydropantoate.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; pantothenate biosynthesis;
    pantoate from 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate: step 1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the panB family.
Complete proteome; Methyltransferase; Pantothenate biosynthesis;
Transferase.
