Sensory rhodopsin I transducer (HTR-I) (Methyl-accepting phototaxis
protein I) (MPP-I).
"Primary structure of an archaebacterial transducer, a methyl-
accepting protein associated with sensory rhodopsin I.";
"The methyl-accepting transducer protein HtrI is functionally
associated with the photoreceptor sensory rhodopsin I in the archaeon
Halobacterium salinarium.";
"Genome sequence of Halobacterium species NRC-1.";
"Phototaxis of Halobacterium salinarium requires a signalling complex
of sensory rhodopsin I and its methyl-accepting transducer HtrI.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transduces signals from the phototaxis receptor sensory
    rhodopsin I (SR-I) to the flagellar motor. Responds to light
    changes through the variation of the level of methylation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 HAMP domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 methyl-accepting transducer domain.
