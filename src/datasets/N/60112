AC   Q837V2;
Aspartyl/glutamyl-tRNA(Asn/Gln) amidotransferase subunit B
(EC 6.3.5.-) (Asp/Glu-ADT subunit B).
"Role of mobile DNA in the evolution of vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus faecalis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Allows the formation of correctly charged Asn-tRNA(Asn)
    or Gln-tRNA(Gln) through the transamidation of misacylated Asp-
    tRNA(Asn) or Glu-tRNA(Gln) in organisms which lack either or both
    of asparaginyl-tRNA or glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases. The reaction
    takes place in the presence of glutamine and ATP through an
    activated phospho-Asp-tRNA(Asn) or phospho-Glu-tRNA(Gln) (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) + L-glutamine = ADP
    + phosphate + L-glutaminyl-tRNA(Gln) + L-glutamate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) + L-glutamine = ADP
    + phosphate + L-asparaginyl-tRNA(Asn) + L-glutamate.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotrimer of A, B and C subunits (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gatB/gatE family. GatB subfamily.
