AC   Q7V872;
Divinyl chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting protein pcbA.
"Genome divergence in two Prochlorococcus ecotypes reflects oceanic
niche differentiation.";
"Low-light-adapted Prochlorococcus species possess specific antennae
for each photosystem.";
-!- FUNCTION: The antenna complex functions as a light receptor, it
    captures and delivers excitation energy to photosystems II. The
    Prochlorales pcb genes are not related to the higher plant LHCs.
-!- COFACTOR: Divinyl chlorophyll a (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Divinyl chlorophyll b (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The antenna complex consists of divinyl chlorophylls (a
    and b) and divinyl chlorophyll a/b binding proteins (By
    similarity). Also forms complexes with PSII, consisting of a PSII
    dimer and 4 or 8 pcbA subunits. These complexes are also found
    under conditions of iron-starvation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cellular thylakoid membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein.
-!- INDUCTION: Transcription decreases upon iron starvation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the psbB/psbC family. IsiA/pcb subfamily.
