TGB1 helicase (EC 3.6.1.-) (Triple gene block 1 protein) (TGBp1) (25
kDa protein) (ORF 2 protein).
"The complete nucleotide sequence of the potexvirus white clover
mosaic virus.";
"Organization and interviral homologies of the coat protein gene of
white clover mosaic virus.";
"A new cell-to-cell transport model for Potexviruses.";
-!- FUNCTION: The three proteins TGB1, TGB2 and TGB3 are required for
    virus movement. Multifunctional protein that has RNA helicase
    activity, promotes translation of viral RNAs, increases
    plasmodesmal size exclusion limits, and suppresses RNA silencing.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the potexviruses/carlaviruses TGB1 helicase
    family.
ATP-binding; Helicase; Hydrolase; Nucleotide-binding; RNA replication;
