Allophycocyanin alpha chain.
"Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the alpha and beta
subunits of allophycocyanin from the cyanelle genome of Cyanophora
paradoxa.";
"Nucleotide sequence of the cyanelle DNA from Cyanophora paradoxa.";
"The complete sequence of the cyanelle genome of Cyanophora paradoxa:

"Major light-harvesting polypeptides encoded in polycistronic
transcripts in a eukaryotic alga.";
-!- FUNCTION: Light-harvesting photosynthetic bile pigment-protein
    from the phycobiliprotein complex. Allophycocyanin has a maximum
    absorption at approximately 650 nanometers.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta chain.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; cyanelle.
-!- PTM: Contains one covalently linked phycocyanobilin chromophore
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phycobiliprotein family.
