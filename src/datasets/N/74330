AC   Q8Y9G5;
Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit hisF (EC 4.1.3.-) (IGP
synthase cyclase subunit) (IGP synthase subunit hisF) (ImGP synthase
subunit hisF) (IGPS subunit hisF).
"Comparative genomics of Listeria species.";
-!- FUNCTION: IGPS catalyzes the conversion of PRFAR and glutamine to
    IGP, AICAR and glutamate. The hisF subunit catalyzes the
    cyclization activity that produces IGP and AICAR from PRFAR using
    the ammonia provided by the hisH subunit (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5-[(5-phospho-1-deoxyribulos-1-
    ylamino)methylideneamino]-1-(5-phosphoribosyl)imidazole-4-
    carboxamide + L-glutamine = imidazole-glycerol phosphate + 5-
    aminoimidazol-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide + L-glutamate + H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-histidine biosynthesis; L-
    histidine from 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate: step 5.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of hisH and hisF (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hisA/hisF family.
