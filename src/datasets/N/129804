AC   Q47VD0;
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [ATP] (EC 4.1.1.49) (PEP
carboxykinase) (Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) (PEPCK).
"The psychrophilic lifestyle as revealed by the genome sequence of
Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H through genomic and proteomic
analyses.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + oxaloacetate = ADP + phosphoenolpyruvate
    + CO(2).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate biosynthesis; gluconeogenesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [ATP]
    family.
ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Decarboxylase; Gluconeogenesis; Lyase;
