AC   Q5DU99;
Plasmid recombination enzyme type 3 (Plasmid recombinase)
(Mobilization protein).
"Staphylococcal tetracycline-MLSB resistance plasmid pSTE2 is the
product of an RSA-mediated in vivo recombination.";
-!- FUNCTION: The interaction of the RSA site and the PRE protein may
    not only serves a function in plasmid maintenance, but may also
    contributes to the distribution of small antibiotic resistance
    plasmids among Gram-positive bacteria (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Contains conserved positively charged amino acids
    probably involved in the binding of the pre protein to the RSA
    site (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the plasmid mobilization pre family.
DNA-binding; Plasmid.
