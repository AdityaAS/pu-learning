AC   P33043;
Protein L5.
"Nucleotide sequence analysis of variola virus HindIII M, L, I genome
fragments.";
"Genes of variola and vaccinia viruses necessary to overcome the host
protective mechanisms.";
"Potential virulence determinants in terminal regions of variola
smallpox virus genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Late protein required for virus entry into host cell and
    for cell-cell fusion (syncytium formation) (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of a stable complex which is at least composed of
    proteins A16, A21, A28, G3, G9, H2, J5, and L5. Formation of the
    viral membrane is necessary for the assembly of the complex (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type III membrane
    protein (Potential). Note=Component of the intracellular mature
    virion (IMV) outer membrane (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Most cysteines are linked by disulfide bonds. They are
    created by the viral disulfide bond formation pathway, a poxvirus-
    specific redox pathway that operates on the cytoplasmic side of
    the IMV membranes (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the poxviruses L5 family.
