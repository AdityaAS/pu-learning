AC   Q7VCC2;
Phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (EC 1.3.7.5).
"Genome sequence of the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus SS120,
a nearly minimal oxyphototrophic genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the four-electron reduction of biliverdin IX-
    alpha (2-electron reduction at both the A and D rings); the
    reaction proceeds via an isolatable 2-electron intermediate,
    181,182-dihydrobiliverdin (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (3Z)-phycocyanobilin + oxidized ferredoxin =
    biliverdin IX-alpha + reduced ferredoxin.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HY2 family.
 GO:0050620; F:phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase a...; IEA:EC.
