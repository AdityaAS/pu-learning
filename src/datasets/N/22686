AC   O46651;
CD166 antigen (Activated leukocyte-cell adhesion molecule) (ALCAM)
(SB-10 antigen) (Fragment).
"Mesenchymal stem cell surface antigen SB-10 corresponds to activated
leukocyte cell adhesion molecule and is involved in osteogenic
differentiation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cell adhesion molecule that binds to CD6. Involved in
    neurite extension by neurons via heterophilic and homophilic
    interactions. May play a role in the binding of T- and B-cells to
    activated leukocytes, as well as in interactions between cells of
    the nervous system (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The CD6 binding site is located in the N-terminal Ig-like
    domain (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like V-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
