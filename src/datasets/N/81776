"Cloning of fox (Vulpes vulpes) IL2, IL6, IL10 and IFNgamma and
analysis of their expression by quantitative RT-PCR in fox PBMC after
in vitro stimulation by concanavalin A.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produced by T-cells in response to antigenic or
    mitogenic stimulation, this protein is required for T-cell
    proliferation and other activities crucial to regulation of the
    immune response. Can stimulate B-cells, monocytes, lymphokine-
    activated killer cells, natural killer cells, and glioma cells (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IL-2 family.
