AC   Q6N734;
Leucyl/phenylalanyl-tRNA--protein transferase (EC 2.3.2.6) (L/F-
transferase) (Leucyltransferase) (Phenyalanyltransferase).
"Complete genome sequence of the metabolically versatile
photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris.";
-!- FUNCTION: Functions in the N-end rule pathway of protein
    degradation where it conjugates Leu, Phe and, less efficiently,
    Met from aminoacyl-tRNAs to the N-termini of proteins containing
    an N-terminal arginine or lysine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-leucyl-tRNA + protein = tRNA + L-leucyl-
    protein.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-phenylalanyl-tRNA + protein = tRNA + L-
    phenylalanyl-protein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the L/F-transferase family.
