AC   Q8UDE5;
Transcription elongation factor greA (Transcript cleavage factor
greA).
"The genome of the natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens
C58.";
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen and biotechnology agent
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.";
-!- FUNCTION: Necessary for efficient RNA polymerase transcription
    elongation past template-encoded arresting sites. The arresting
    sites in DNA have the property of trapping a certain fraction of
    elongating RNA polymerases that pass through, resulting in locked
    ternary complexes. Cleavage of the nascent transcript by cleavage
    factors such as greA or greB allows the resumption of elongation
    from the new 3'terminus. GreA releases sequences of 2 to 3
    nucleotides (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the greA/greB family.
