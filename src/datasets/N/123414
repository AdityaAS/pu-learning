AC   Q5H3H2;
Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase (EC 1.4.3.5) (PNP/PMP oxidase)
(PNPOx).
"The genome sequence of Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae KACC10331,
the bacterial blight pathogen of rice.";
-!- FUNCTION: Oxidizes PNP and PMP into pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)
    (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate + H(2)O + O(2) =
    pyridoxal 5'-phosphate + NH(3) + H(2)O(2).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Pyridoxine 5'-phosphate + O(2) = pyridoxal 5'-
    phosphate + H(2)O(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FMN per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; B6 vitamer interconversion;
    pyridoxal 5'-phosphate from pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate: single
    step.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; B6 vitamer interconversion;
    pyridoxal 5'-phosphate from pyridoxine 5'-phosphate: single step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase
    family.
