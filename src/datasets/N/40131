-!- FUNCTION: Involved in innate immune defense against viruses. Upon
    interaction with intracellular dsRNA produced during viral
    replication, triggers a transduction cascade involving MAVS, which
    results in the activation of NF-kappa-B, IRF3 and IRF7 and the
    induction of the expression of antiviral cytokines such as IFN-
    beta and RANTES (CCL5). Essential for the production of
    interferons in response to RNA viruses including paramyxoviruses,
    influenza viruses and Japanese encephalitis virus (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with MAVS/IPS1.
-!- INTERACTION:
    Q7Z434:MAVS; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-995350, EBI-995373;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:

    Name=1;
      IsoId=O95786-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=O95786-2; Sequence=VSP_016054;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Present in vascular smooth cells (at protein
    level).
-!- INDUCTION: By bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in endothelial
    cells. By IFN-alpha, -beta and -gamma.
-!- DOMAIN: The helicase domain is responsible for dsRNA recognition.
-!- DOMAIN: The 2 CARD domains are responsible for interaction with
    and signaling through MAVS.
-!- PTM: Isgylated. Conjugated to ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 upon
    IFN-beta stimulation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the helicase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 CARD domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase C-terminal domain.
