AC   Q48KR3;
Cell division protein zipA homolog.
"Whole-genome sequence analysis of Pseudomonas syringae pv.
phaseolicola 1448A reveals divergence among pathovars in genes
involved in virulence and transposition.";
-!- FUNCTION: Interacts directly with the cell division protein ftsZ.
    Probable receptor for the septal ring structure, may anchor it to
    the inner-membrane (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; single-pass type I
    membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the zipA family.
