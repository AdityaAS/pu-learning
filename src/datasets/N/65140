hydroxymethyltransferase and an analysis of the evolutionary
relationships among serine hydroxymethyltransferases.";
"cDNA cloning, overexpression in Escherichia coli, purification and
characterization of sheep liver cytosolic serine
hydroxymethyltransferase.";
-!- FUNCTION: Interconversion of serine and glycine.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + glycine +
    H(2)O = tetrahydrofolate + L-serine.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: One-carbon metabolism; tetrahydrofolate pathway.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: In eukaryotes there are two forms of the enzymes: a
    cytosolic one and a mitochondrial one.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SHMT family.
Acetylation; Direct protein sequencing; One-carbon metabolism;
Pyridoxal phosphate; Transferase.
