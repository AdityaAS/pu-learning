Achaete-scute homolog 1.
"Two rat homologues of Drosophila achaete-scute specifically expressed
in neuronal precursors.";
-!- FUNCTION: May play a role at early stages of development of
    specific neural lineages in most regions of the CNS, and of
    several lineages in the PNS. Essential for the generation of
    olfactory and autonomic neurons. Activates transcription by
    binding to the E box (5'-CANNTG-3').
-!- SUBUNIT: Efficient DNA binding requires dimerization with another
    bHLH protein. Forms a heterodimer with TCF3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Developing CNS and PNS at embryonic and post-
    natal stages.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: It is first observed after neurulation, in
    10.5 day old (E10.5) rat embryos, and is restricted to subsets of
    neuroepithelial cells in the spinal cord and the brain, between
    E10.5 and E13.5. In the periphery, its expression is restricted to
    some lineages of neural crest-derived cells, namely in sympathetic
    and enteric neural precursors. In the PNS its expression is
    extinguished at or before differentiation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain.
