AC   Q9PQ53;
DNA polymerase IV (EC 2.7.7.7) (Pol IV).
"The complete sequence of the mucosal pathogen Ureaplasma
urealyticum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Poorly processive, error-prone DNA polymerase involved
    in untargeted mutagenesis. Copies undamaged DNA at stalled
    replication forks, which arise in vivo from mismatched or
    misaligned primer ends. These misaligned primers can be extended
    by polIV. Exhibits no 3'-5' exonuclease (proofreading) activity.
    May be involved in translesional synthesis, in conjunction with
    the beta clamp from polIII (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA polymerase type-Y family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 umuC domain.
