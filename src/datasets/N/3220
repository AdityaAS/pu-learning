-!- FUNCTION: Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved
    in various types of cell motility and are ubiquitously expressed
    in all eukaryotic cells.
-!- FUNCTION: Multiple isoforms are involved in various cellular
    functions such as cytoskeleton structure, cell mobility,
    chromosome movement and muscle contraction.
