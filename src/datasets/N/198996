AC   Q4ZUD2;
Urease alpha subunit 1 (EC 3.5.1.5) (Urea amidohydrolase alpha subunit
1).
"Comparison of the complete genome sequences of Pseudomonas syringae
pv. syringae B728a and pv. tomato DC3000.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Urea + H(2)O = CO(2) + 2 NH(3).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 nickel ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Nitrogen metabolism; urea degradation; CO(2) and NH(3)
    from urea (urease route): single step [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: May form a heterohexamer of 3 ureC (alpha) and 3 ureAB
    (gamma/beta) subunits. May also form a heterotrimer of ureA
    (gamma), ureB (beta) and ureC (alpha) subunits. Three
    heterotrimers associate to form the active enzyme (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Carbamylation allows a single lysine to coordinate two nickel
    ions (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the urease family.
