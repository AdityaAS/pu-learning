AC   Q66DT3;
ATP-dependent Clp protease ATP-binding subunit clpX.
"Insights into the evolution of Yersinia pestis through whole-genome
comparison with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: ATP-dependent specificity component of the Clp protease.
    It directs the protease to specific substrates. Can perform
    chaperone functions in the absence of clpP (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of clpP and clpX (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the clpX chaperone family.
