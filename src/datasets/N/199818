AC   Q8BUB6;
Uronyl 2-sulfotransferase (EC 2.8.2.-).
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Sulfotransferase that catalyzes the transfer of sulfate
    to the position 2 of uronyl residues. Has mainly activity toward
    iduronyl residues in dermatan sulfate, and weaker activity toward
    glucuronyl residues of chondroitin sulfate. Has no activity toward
    desulfated N-resulfated heparin (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane;
    single-pass type II membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sulfotransferase 3 family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (BAC39625) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 318.
