Pigment epithelium-derived factor precursor (PEDF) (Serpin-F1).
"Pigment epithelium-derived factor behaves like a noninhibitory
serpin. Neurotrophic activity does not require the serpin reactive
loop.";
-!- FUNCTION: Neurotrophic protein; induces extensive neuronal
    differentiation in retinoblastoma cells. Potent inhibitor of
    angiogenesis. As it does not undergo the S (stressed) to R
    (relaxed) conformational transition characteristic of active
    serpins, it exhibits no serine protease inhibitory activity.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Retinal pigment epithelial cells. Located in
    the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) which is between the retinal
    pigment epithelium and the neural retina.
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal (AA 42-139) exhibits neurite outgrowth-
    inducing activity. The C-terminal exposed loop (AA 380-416) is
    essential for serpin activity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the serpin family.
