Phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (Clathrin
assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia) (CALM).
"Mutations in the clathrin-assembly gene Picalm are responsible for
the hematopoietic and iron metabolism abnormalities in fit1 mice.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"Mutations in the murine fitness 1 gene result in defective
hematopoiesis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Assembly protein recruiting clathrin and adaptor protein
    complex 2 (AP2) to cell membranes at sites of coated-pit formation
    and clathrin-vesicle assembly. May be required to determine the
    amount of membrane to be recycled, possibly by regulating the size
    of the clathrin cage. Involved in AP2-dependent clathrin-mediated
    endocytosis at the neuromuscular junction. Plays a crucial role in
    fetal and adult hematopoiesis, and normal prenatal and postnatal
    growth and viability.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds clathrin and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; coated pit; clathrin-coated
    pit (By similarity). Golgi apparatus (By similarity). Cytoplasmic
    vesicle; clathrin-coated vesicle (By similarity). Note=Colocalized
    with clathrin in the Golgi area (By similarity).
