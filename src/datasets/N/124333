-!- FUNCTION: Removal of H(2)O(2), oxidation of toxic reductants,
    biosynthesis and degradation of lignin, suberization, auxin
    catabolism, response to environmental stresses such as wounding,
    pathogen attack and oxidative stress. These functions might be
    dependent on each isozyme/isoform in each plant tissue.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Donor + H(2)O(2) = oxidized donor + 2 H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 heme B (iron-protoporphyrin IX) group per
    subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 calcium ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: There are 73 peroxidase genes in A.thaliana.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peroxidase family. Classical plant
    (class III) peroxidase subfamily.
