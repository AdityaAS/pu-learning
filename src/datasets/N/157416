AC   O74825;
DNA-directed RNA polymerase II 16 kDa polypeptide (EC 2.7.7.6).
"The Rpb4 subunit of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe RNA
polymerase II is essential for cell viability and similar in structure
to the corresponding subunits of higher eukaryotes.";
"RNA polymerase II from Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains 12
different subunits: identification and characterization of subunit
Rpb4.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription
    of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as
    substrates. Associates with rpb7.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: RNA polymerase II consists of 12 different subunits (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are
    found in eukaryotic nuclei: polymerase I for the ribosomal RNA
    precursor, polymerase II for the mRNA precursor, and polymerase
    III for 5S and tRNA genes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eukaryotic RPB4 RNA polymerase subunit
    family.
