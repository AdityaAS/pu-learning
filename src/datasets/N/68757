AC   Q6GJQ6;
GMP synthase [glutamine-hydrolyzing] (EC 6.3.5.2) (Glutamine
amidotransferase) (GMP synthetase).
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the synthesis of GMP from XMP (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + xanthosine 5'-phosphate + L-glutamine +
    H(2)O = AMP + diphosphate + GMP + L-glutamate.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; GMP biosynthesis; GMP from XMP
    (glutamine route): single step [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 glutamine amidotransferase type-1 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 GMP-binding domain.
