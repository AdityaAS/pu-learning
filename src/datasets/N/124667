AC   Q8WI03;
Cytochrome b6-f complex subunit 6 (Cytochrome b6-f complex subunit VI)
(Cytochrome b6-f complex subunit petL).
"Complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genome from a fern,
Psilotum nudum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the cytochrome b6-f complex, which mediates
    electron transfer between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I
    (PSI), cyclic electron flow around PSI, and state transitions.
    PetL is important for photoautotrophic growth as well as for
    electron transfer efficiency and stability of the cytochrome b6-f
    complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The 4 large subunits of the cytochrome b6-f complex are
    cytochrome b6, subunit IV (17 kDa polypeptide, petD), cytochrome f
    and the Rieske protein, while the 4 small subunits are petG, petL,
    petM and petN. The complex functions as a dimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; single-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the petL family.
