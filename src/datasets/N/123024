AC   Q6V9H4;
Platelet-derived growth factor D precursor (PDGF D) (Iris-expressed
growth factor) (Fragment).
"Platelet-derived growth factor D, tissue-specific expression in the
eye, and a key role in control of lens epithelial cell
proliferation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin. Binding
    of this growth factor to its affinity receptor elicits a variety
    of cellular responses. It is released by platelets upon wounding
    and plays an important role in stimulating adjacent cells to grow
    and thereby heals the wound. Activated by proteolytic cleavage and
    this active form acts as a specific ligand for beta platelet-
    derived growth factor receptor (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer; disulfide-linked (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Proteolytic removal of the N-terminal CUB domain releasing
    the core domain is necessary for unmasking the receptor-binding
    epitopes of the core domain. Cleavage after Arg-191 or Arg-193 by
    urokinase plasminogen activator gives rise to the active form (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CUB domain.
Cleavage on pair of basic residues; Glycoprotein; Growth factor;
Mitogen.
