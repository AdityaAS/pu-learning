AC   P48805;
Fibroblast growth factor 4-I precursor (FGF-4-I) (HBGF-4-I) (Embryonic
fibroblast growth factor I) (XEFGF-I).
"Expression of a novel FGF in the Xenopus embryo. A new candidate
inducing factor for mesoderm formation and anteroposterior
specification.";
-!- FUNCTION: Good candidate for an inducing factor with possible
    roles both in mesoderm induction at the blastula stage and in the
    formation of the anteroposterior axis at the gastrula stage.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the heparin-binding growth factors family.
