AC   Q03323;
COMPASS component SDC1 (Complex proteins associated with SET1 protein
SDC1) (Set1C component SDC1) (Suppressor of CDC25 protein 1).
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IV.";
"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Set1 complex includes an Ash2 homologue
and methylates histone 3 lysine 4.";
"COMPASS, a histone H3 (Lysine 4) methyltransferase required for
telomeric silencing of gene expression.";
"COMPASS: a complex of proteins associated with a trithorax-related
SET domain protein.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
-!- FUNCTION: The COMPASS (Set1C) complex specifically methylates
    'Lys-4' of histone H3, which subsequently plays a role in telomere
    length maintenance.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the COMPASS (Set1C) complex which consists
    of SET1(2), BRE2(2), SPP1(2), SDC1(1), SHG1(1), SWD1(1), SWD2(1),
    and SWD3(1).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P43132:BRE2; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-38307, EBI-27115;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 937 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dpy-30 family.
