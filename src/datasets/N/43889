AC   Q8PXH2;
DNA polymerase II large subunit (EC 2.7.7.7) (Pol II).
"The genome of Methanosarcina mazei: evidence for lateral gene
transfer between Bacteria and Archaea.";
-!- FUNCTION: Possesses two activities: a DNA synthesis (polymerase)
    and an exonucleolytic activity that degrades single stranded DNA
    in the 3' to 5' direction. Has a template-primer preference which
    is characteristic of a replicative DNA polymerase (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Degradation of single-stranded DNA. It acts
    progressively in a 3'- to 5'-direction, releasing nucleoside 5'-
    phosphates.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a large subunit and a small subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the archaeal DNA polymerase II family.
