bioinformatics assessment.";

of pFGE, the paralog of the Calpha-formylglycine-generating enzyme.";

formylglycine-generating enzyme.";
-!- FUNCTION: Seems to lack formyl-glycine generating activity and to
    be unable to convert newly synthesized inactive sulfatases to
    their active form by modifying an active site cysteine residue to
    3-oxoalanine. Overexpression of SUMF2 inhibits the activation of
    sulfatases by SUMF1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    lumen.
