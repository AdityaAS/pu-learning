AC   P0A4C9; P28543;
30S ribosomal protein S5.
"Genome sequences of Chlamydia trachomatis MoPn and Chlamydia
pneumoniae AR39.";
-!- FUNCTION: With S4 and S12 plays an important role in translational
    accuracy (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: Located at the back of the 30S subunit body where it
    stabilizes the conformation of the head with respect to the body
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts proteins S4
    and S8 (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal domain interacts with the head of the 30S
    subunit; the C-terminal domain interacts with the body and
    contacts protein S4. The interaction surface between S4 and S5 is
    involved in control of translational fidelity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S5P family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 S5 DRBM domain.
