AC   P17087;
Urease subunit beta (EC 3.5.1.5) (Urea amidohydrolase subunit beta).
"Proteus mirabilis urease: nucleotide sequence determination and
comparison with jack bean urease.";
"Proteus mirabilis urease: histidine 320 of UreC is essential for urea
hydrolysis and nickel ion binding within the native enzyme.";
"Proteus mirabilis urease: transcriptional regulation by UreR.";
"Proteus mirabilis urease: operon fusion and linker insertion analysis
of ure gene organization, regulation, and function.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Urea + H(2)O = CO(2) + 2 NH(3).
-!- PATHWAY: Nitrogen metabolism; urea degradation; CO(2) and NH(3)
    from urea (urease route): single step [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Probable heterotrimer of ureA (gamma), ureB (beta) and
    ureC (alpha) subunits. Three heterotrimers associate to form the
    active enzyme. The trimeric urease interacts with an accessory
    complex composed of ureD, ureF and ureG, which is required for the
    assembly of the nickel containing metallocenter of ureC. The ureE
    protein may also play a direct role in nickel transfer to the
    urease apoprotein.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- INDUCTION: By urea.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the urease beta subunit family.
Hydrolase.
