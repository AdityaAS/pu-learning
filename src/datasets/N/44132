AC   O84549;
DNA polymerase III subunit alpha (EC 2.7.7.7).
"Genome sequence of an obligate intracellular pathogen of humans:
Chlamydia trachomatis.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA polymerase III is a complex, multichain enzyme
    responsible for most of the replicative synthesis in bacteria.
    This DNA polymerase also exhibits 3' to 5' exonuclease activity.
    The alpha chain is the DNA polymerase (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: DNA polymerase III contains a core (composed of alpha,
    epsilon and theta chains) that associates with a tau subunit. This
    core dimerizes to form the PolIII' complex. PolIII' associates
    with the gamma complex (composed of gamma, delta, delta', psi and
    chi chains) and with the beta chain to form the complete DNA
    polymerase III complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA polymerase type-C family. DnaE
    subfamily.
Complete proteome; DNA replication; DNA-directed DNA polymerase;
Nucleotidyltransferase; Transferase.
