AC   Q04749;
Target of rapamycin complex 2 subunit AVO2 (TORC2 subunit AVO2)
(Adheres voraciously to TOR2 protein 2).
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
XIII.";
"Two TOR complexes, only one of which is rapamycin sensitive, have
distinct roles in cell growth control.";
"Tor kinases are in distinct membrane-associated protein complexes in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.";
"Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.";
"The pleckstrin homology domain proteins Slm1 and Slm2 are required
for actin cytoskeleton organization in yeast and bind
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and TORC2.";
"Molecular organization of target of rapamycin complex 2.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of TORC2, which regulates cell cycle-dependent
    polarization of the actin-cytoskeleton and cell wall integrity.
    TORC2 controls polarity of the actin cytoskeleton, which is
    required for orienting the secretory pathway toward discrete
    growth sites, via the RHO1/PKC1/MAPK cell integrity pathway.
-!- SUBUNIT: The target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) is composed of
    at least AVO1, AVO2, BIT61, LST8, TOR2 and TSC11. TORC2 likely
    forms a homodimer. Contrary to TORC1, TORC2 does not bind to and
    is not sensitive to FKBP-rapamycin. AVO2 is peripherally
    associated to AVO1 and TSC11.

    protein; cytoplasmic side.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 1180 molecules/cell.
