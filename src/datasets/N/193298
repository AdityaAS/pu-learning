AC   P26924;
Anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.18).
"Relationship between tryptophan biosynthesis and indole-3-acetic acid
production in Azospirillum: identification and sequencing of a trpGDC
cluster.";
-!- FUNCTION: Participates in the tryptophan-dependent indole-3-acetic
    acid production, which is a phytohormone released by A.brasilense.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: N-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)-anthranilate +
    diphosphate = anthranilate + 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-
    diphosphate.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-tryptophan biosynthesis; L-
    tryptophan from chorismate: step 2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase
    family.
Amino-acid biosynthesis; Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis;
Glycosyltransferase; Transferase; Tryptophan biosynthesis.
