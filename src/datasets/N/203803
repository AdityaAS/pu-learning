VIP peptides precursor [Contains: Intestinal peptide PHI-27 (Peptide
histidine isoleucinamide 27); Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)
(Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide)] (Fragment).
"Isolation and characterization of the intestinal peptide porcine PHI
(PHI-27), a new member of the glucagon-secretin family.";
"Organ distribution and characterization of porcine peptides (VIP,
CGRP and PHI) that increase cAMP in rat platelets.";
"Isolation and characterization of a variant form of vasoactive
intestinal polypeptide.";
"Structure of the porcine vasoactive intestinal octacosapeptide. The
amino-acid sequence. Use of kallikrein in its determination.";
"Synthesis of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).";
-!- FUNCTION: VIP causes vasodilation, lowers arterial blood pressure,
    stimulates myocardial contractility, increases glycogenolysis and
    relaxes the smooth muscle of trachea, stomach and gall bladder.
-!- FUNCTION: PHI also causes vasodilation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: X's at positions 28 to 44 were included by homology
    with the human precursor sequence.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glucagon family.
Amidation; Cleavage on pair of basic residues;
