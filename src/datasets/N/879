AC   O74455;
Probable 6-phosphogluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.31) (6PGL).
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: Hydrolysis of 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-
    phosphogluconate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 6-phospho-D-glucono-1,5-lactone + H(2)O = 6-
    phospho-D-gluconate.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; pentose phosphate pathway; D-
    ribulose 5-phosphate from D-glucose 6-phosphate (oxidative stage):
    step 2.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glucosamine/galactosamine-6-phosphate
    isomerase family. 6-phosphogluconolactonase subfamily.
