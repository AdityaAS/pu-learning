AC   Q7HIV1;
Cytochrome b559 beta subunit (PSII reaction center subunit VI).
"Long branches in the seed plants and the root of the angiosperms.";
-!- FUNCTION: This b-type cytochrome is tightly associated with the
    reaction center of photosystem II and possibly is part of the
    water-oxidation complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha subunit and a beta subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; single-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the psbE/psbF family.
