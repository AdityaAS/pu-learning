AC   Q6PCG0;
14-3-3 protein gamma-A.
-!- FUNCTION: Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large
    spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathway. Binds
    to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a
    phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results
    in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 14-3-3 family.
