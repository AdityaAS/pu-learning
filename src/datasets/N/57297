AC   Q9YHV4;
Follistatin precursor (FS) (Activin-binding protein).
"Follistatin and noggin are excluded from the zebrafish organizer.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds directly to activin and functions as an activin
    antagonist. Probable inhibitor of bone morphogenetic proteins
    (BMP) signaling during later stages of development including late
    phases of dorsoventral patterning, to refine the early pattern set
    up by the interaction of chordino and BMP2/4. Not involved in
    organizer function or early phases of dorsoventral pattern
    formation. Specific inhibitor of the biosynthesis and secretion of
    pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (Potential).
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expression starts at mid-gastrula stages.
    Expression in gastrulating embryos are confined to anterior and
    paraxial regions which give rise to head mesoderm and the first
    five somites. A transient expression is seen in a subset of cells
    in the posterior notochord anlage. Later expression is seen in
    brain, eyes and somites.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 follistatin-like domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Kazal-like domains.
