NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 7
(EC 1.6.5.3) (EC 1.6.99.3) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit
B14.5a) (Complex I-B14.5a) (CI-B14.5a).
"cDNA of eight nuclear encoded subunits of NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase: human complex I cDNA characterization completed.";
"Cloning and functional analysis of cDNAs with open reading frames for
300 previously undefined genes expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory
    chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed
    to be ubiquinone.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone = NAD(+) + ubiquinol.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + acceptor = NAD(+) + reduced acceptor.
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex I is composed of 45 different subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    matrix side.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I NDUFA7 subunit family.
