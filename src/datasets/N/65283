oxidoreductase 1) (Guanosine monophosphate reductase 1).

-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the irreversible NADPH-dependent deamination
    of GMP to IMP. It functions in the conversion of nucleobase,
    nucleoside and nucleotide derivatives of G to A nucleotides, and
    in maintaining the intracellular balance of A and G nucleotides.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Inosine 5'-phosphate + NH(3) + NADP(+) =
    guanosine 5'-phosphate + NADPH.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: At least two different alleles are known.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IMPDH/GMPR family.
-!- CAUTION: The N-terminus was initially (Ref.1) thought to be fused
    in glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) protein in vivo.
    However, Ref.5 showed that it encodes a GMP reductase, and Ref.6
    showed that the chimeric protein is an artifact.
