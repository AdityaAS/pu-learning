AC   Q9EUT6;
Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.27) (ADP-glucose
synthase) (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) (ADPGlc PPase).
"Enhanced symbiotic performance by Rhizobium tropici glycogen synthase
mutants.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate =
    diphosphate + ADP-glucose.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycogen biosynthesis; first step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial/plant glucose-1-phosphate
    adenylyltransferase family.
Glycogen biosynthesis; Nucleotidyltransferase; Transferase.
