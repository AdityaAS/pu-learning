AC   Q5L3U7;
Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.29) (PTH).
"Thermoadaptation trait revealed by the genome sequence of
thermophilic Geobacillus kaustophilus.";
-!- FUNCTION: The natural substrate for this enzyme may be peptidyl-
    tRNAs which drop off the ribosome during protein synthesis (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: N-substituted aminoacyl-tRNA + H(2)O = N-
    substituted amino acid + tRNA.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PTH family.
Complete proteome; Hydrolase.
