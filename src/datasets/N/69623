AC   Q00728;
Histone H2A type 4 (Histone H2A, testis) (TH2A).
"Presence of a bi-directional S phase-specific transcription
regulatory element in the promoter shared by testis-specific TH2A and
TH2B histone genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and
    compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the
    cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones
    thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA
    repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA
    accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational
    modifications of histones, also called histone code, and
    nucleosome remodelling.
-!- SUBUNIT: The nucleosome is a histone octamer containing two
    molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 assembled in one H3-H4
    heterotetramer and two H2A-H2B heterodimers. The octamer wraps
    approximately 147 bp of DNA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Testis.
-!- DOMAIN: The [ST]-Q motif constitutes a recognition sequence for
    kinases from the PI3/PI4-kinase family.
-!- PTM: The chromatin-associated form is phosphorylated on Thr-120
    during mitosis (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Monoubiquitination of Lys-119 by RING1 and RNF2/RING2 complex
    gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-1 is enhanced during mitosis.
    Phosphorylation on Ser-1 by RPS6KA5/MSK1 directly represses
    transcription. Acetylation of H3 inhibits Ser-1 phosphorylation by
    RPS6KA5/MSK1 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the histone H2A family.
