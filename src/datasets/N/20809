AC   Q3ZDQ5;
Caveolin-3.
"Characterization of the porcine caveolin 3 gene and its expression in
various tissues and during development.";
-!- FUNCTION: May act as a scaffolding protein within caveolar
    membranes. Interacts directly with G-protein alpha subunits and
    can functionally regulate their activity. May also regulate
    voltage-gated potassium channels (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homooligomer. Interacts with DLG1 and KCNA5 and forms a
    ternary complex (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane;
    peripheral membrane protein; cytoplasmic side (By similarity).
    Cell membrane; caveola; peripheral membrane protein; cytoplasmic
    side (By similarity). Note=Membrane protein of protein of
    caveolae. Potential hairpin-like structure in the membrane (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the caveolin family.
Membrane; Transmembrane.
