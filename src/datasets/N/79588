Protein-S-isoprenylcysteine O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.100)
(Isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase) (Prenylcysteine carboxyl
methyltransferase) (pcCMT) (Prenylated protein carboxyl
methyltransferase) (PPMT) (Farnesyl cysteine carboxyl
methyltransferase) (FCMT).
"Genes encoding farnesyl cysteine carboxyl methyltransferase in
Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Xenopus laevis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the posttranslational methylation of
    isoprenylated C-terminal cysteine residues.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + protein C-terminal
    S-farnesyl-L-cysteine = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + protein C-
    terminal S-farnesyl-L-cysteine methyl ester.
-!- COFACTOR: Divalent cations. Probably zinc (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the isoprenylcysteine O-methyltransferase
    family.
