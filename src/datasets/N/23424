AC   Q6GIB7;
Coenzyme A disulfide reductase (EC 1.8.1.14) (CoA-disulfide reductase)
(CoADR).
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes specifically the NADPH-dependent reduction of
    coenzyme A disulfide (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 CoA + NAD(P)(+) = CoA-disulfide + NAD(P)H.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD non-covalently per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Contains 2 FAD binding domains and a single NADPH binding
    domain (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Reduction of disulfides occurs by a thiol-disulfide
    exchange reaction, but involves only a single catalytic cysteine
    residue that forms a stable mixed disulfide with CoA during
    catalysis (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-III pyridine nucleotide-disulfide
    oxidoreductase family.
