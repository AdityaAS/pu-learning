"NPR1 differentially interacts with members of the TGA/OBF family of
transcription factors that bind an element of the PR-1 gene required
for induction by salicylic acid.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator that binds specifically to the
    DNA sequence 5'-TGACG-3'. Recognizes ocs elements like the as-1
    motif of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Binding to the
    as-1-like cis elements mediate auxin- and salicylic acid-inducible
    transcription. May be involved in the induction of the systemic
    aquired resistance (SAR) via its interaction with NPR1. Could also
    bind to the Hex-motif (5'-TGACGTGG-3') another cis-acting element
    found in plant histone promoters (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds DNA as a dimer. Interacts with NPR1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q39140-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q39140-2; Sequence=VSP_009468;
      Note=May be due to an intron retention. No experimental
      confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed predominantly in roots and flowers.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed primarily in roots of young
    seedlings and later expressed in aging cotyledons, mesophyll cells
    of hydathodes on leaf margins, vascular tissue and trichomes of
    senescing rosette leaves. Also detected in young lateral roots and
    in mature pollen grains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bZIP family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 bZIP domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.4 sequence differs from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
