Glutamate decarboxylase beta (EC 4.1.1.15) (GAD-beta).
"A glutamate decarboxylase system protects Listeria monocytogenes in
gastric fluid.";
"Comparative genomics of Listeria species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Converts internalized glutamate to GABA and increases
    the internal pH. Involved in glutamate-dependent acid resistance
    in gastric fluid.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-glutamate = 4-aminobutanoate + CO(2).
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the group II decarboxylase family.
Complete proteome; Decarboxylase; Lyase; Pyridoxal phosphate.
