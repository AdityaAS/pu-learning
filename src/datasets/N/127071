AC   Q94G00;
Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase 1 (EC 5.2.1.8) (Rotamase Pin1)
(PPIase Pin1) (MdPin1).
"Functional conservation of phosphorylation-specific prolyl isomerases
in plants.";
-!- FUNCTION: Prolyl cis/trans isomerase with specificity for phospho-
    Ser-Pro bonds.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Peptidylproline (omega=180) = peptidylproline
    (omega=0).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited in vitro by juglone.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed in 1 to 3 week-old fruit but not in
    mature fruit. Expression is tightly associated with cell division.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Like all plant Pin1-type PPIases, do not contain
    the N-terminal WW domain found in other eukaryotic parvulins, but
    contains a four-amino acid insertion next to the phospho-specific
    recognition site of the active site. These extra amino acids may
    be important for mediating the substrate interaction of plant
    enzymes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ppiC/parvulin rotamase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 PpiC domain.
Isomerase; Rotamase.
