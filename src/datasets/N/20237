AC   O42779;
Candidapepsin-9 precursor (EC 3.4.23.24) (Aspartate protease 9) (ACP
9) (Secreted aspartic protease 9).
"Differential regulation of SAP8 and SAP9, which encode two new
members of the secreted aspartic proteinase family in Candida
albicans.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Preferential cleavage at the carboxyl of
    hydrophobic amino acids, but fails to cleave 15-Leu-|-Tyr-16, 16-
    Tyr-|-Leu-17 and 24-Phe-|-Phe-25 of insulin B chain. Activates
    trypsinogen, and degrades keratin.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- PTM: O-glycosylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase A1 family.
Aspartyl protease; Glycoprotein; Hydrolase; Protease; Signal; Zymogen.
