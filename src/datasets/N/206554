AC   P28140;
Protein Wnt-3a (Fragment).
"Diversification of the Wnt gene family on the ancestral lineage of
vertebrates.";
-!- FUNCTION: Ligand for members of the frizzled family of seven
    transmembrane receptors. Probable developmental protein. May be a
    signaling molecule which affects the development of discrete
    regions of tissues. Is likely to signal over only few cell
    diameters.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein; extracellular space;
    extracellular matrix.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Wnt family.
