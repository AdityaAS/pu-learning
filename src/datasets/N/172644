SLAM family member 7 precursor (Leukocyte cell-surface antigen) (Novel
Ly9).
"Mouse novel Ly9: a new member of the expanding CD150 (SLAM) family of
leukocyte cell-surface receptors.";

project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates NK cell activation through a SAP-independent
    extracellular signal-regulated ERK-mediated pathway. May play a
    role in lymphocyte adhesion (By similarity). Isoform 1 does not
    bind SAP (in vitro).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=4;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q8BHK6-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q8BHK6-2; Sequence=VSP_013784;
    Name=3;
      IsoId=Q8BHK6-3; Sequence=VSP_013783, VSP_013784;
    Name=4;
      IsoId=Q8BHK6-4; Sequence=VSP_013783;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in spleen, lymph node, bone marrow
    and testis. Lower levels detected in thymus. Expressed in NK cells
    and B-cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (AAH11154) sequence differs from that shown due to
    a frameshift in position 255.
