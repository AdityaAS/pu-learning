AC   Q9BBR0;
Chloroplast 50S ribosomal protein L20.
"Complete structure of the chloroplast genome of a legume, Lotus
japonicus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds directly to 23S ribosomal RNA and is necessary for
    the in vitro assembly process of the 50S ribosomal subunit. It is
    not involved in the protein synthesizing functions of that subunit
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L20P family.
