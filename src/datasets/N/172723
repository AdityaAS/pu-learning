-!- FUNCTION: Suppresses neurite outgrowth (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q9H5Y7-1; Sequence=Displayed;

    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q9H5Y7-2; Sequence=VSP_050711, VSP_050712;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: In adult brain, highly expressed in putamen
    with no expression in cerebral cortex. Expressed in adult and
    fetal lung and fetal liver. Also expressed at high levels in some
    brain tumors including medulloblastomas and primitive
    neuroectodermal tumors.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SLITRK family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 16 LRR (leucine-rich) repeats.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.4 (BAB15480) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 468, 489, 501 and 519.
