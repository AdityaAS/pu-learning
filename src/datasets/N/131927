AC   P22271;
Profilin-A.
"Cell-specific expression of a profilin gene family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to actin and affects the structure of the
    cytoskeleton. At high concentrations, profilin prevents the
    polymerization of actin, whereas it enhances it at low
    concentrations. By binding to PIP2, it inhibits the formation of
    IP3 and DG.
-!- SUBUNIT: Occurs in many kinds of cells as a complex with monomeric
    actin in a 1:1 ratio.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the profilin family.
