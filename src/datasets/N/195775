-!- FUNCTION: This is a copper-containing oxidase that functions in
    the formation of pigments such as melanins and other polyphenolic
    compounds.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-tyrosine + L-dopa + O(2) = L-dopa +
    dopaquinone + H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 copper ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The strain TS sequence is shown.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tyrosinase family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (CAE81941) sequence differs from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.3 (EAA35696) sequence differs from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
