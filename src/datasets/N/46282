Transcription factor E2F5 (E2F-5).
"Molecular and functional characterisation of E2F-5, a new member of
the E2F family.";
"Expression patterns of the E2F family of transcription factors during
mouse nervous system development.";
"Expression patterns of the E2F family of transcription factors during
murine epithelial development.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator that binds to E2F sites, these
    sites are present in the promoter of many genes whose products are
    involved in cell proliferation. May mediate growth factor-
    initiated signal transduction.
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the DRTF1/E2F transcription factor complex.
    Binds cooperatively with DP-1 to E2F sites. Interacts
    preferentially with retinoblastoma-related pocket proteins p130
    and to a lesser extent with p107, that inhibit the E2F
    transactivation domain.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: In the developing epidermis, first detected
    in 13.5-14.5 dpc embryos. With the appearance of stratified
    epithelium, levels of E2F-5 expression increase and by 16.5 dpc,
    high expression found in the suprabasal cell layers. High
    expression also found in other regions with stratified squamous
    epithelia including the developing palate, lip and tongue. In the
    developing nervous system, first detected in the forebrain at 9.5
    dpc. At 10.5 dpc, strongly expressed in the rostral region of the
    spinal cord. By 11.5 dpc, E2F-5 is expressed throughout the
    developing central nervous system. In 12.5-15.5 dpc embryos,
    expression found in the undifferentiated ventricular regions of
    the brain. In the retina, expressed, in 14.5-18.5 dpc embryos, in
    the retinoblastic cell layer. In other developing tissues, highly
    expressed in the choroid plexus. Also found in the kidney, liver,
    lung, heart and weakly, in developing skeletal muscle and
    chondrocytes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the E2F/DP family.
