project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of
    secretory vesicles through Ca(2+) and phospholipid binding to the
    C2 domain or may serve as Ca(2+) sensors in the process of
    vesicular trafficking and exocytosis (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 3 calcium ions per subunit. The ions are bound to
    the C2 domains (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Can also form heterodimers (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic vesicle; secretory vesicle;
    synaptic vesicle; synaptic vesicle membrane; single-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The first C2 domain mediates Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid
    binding.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the synaptotagmin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 C2 domains.
