Exportin-1 (Chromosome region maintenance protein 1) (Caffeine
resistance protein 2).
"Higher order chromosome structure is affected by cold-sensitive
mutations in a Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene crm1+ which encodes a
115-kD protein preferentially localized in the nucleus and its
periphery.";
"Fission yeast pap1-dependent transcription is negatively regulated by
an essential nuclear protein, crm1.";
"Leptomycin B targets a regulatory cascade of crm1, a fission yeast
nuclear protein, involved in control of higher order chromosome
structure and gene expression.";
"Leptomycin B inactivates CRM1/exportin 1 by covalent modification at
a cysteine residue in the central conserved region.";
"Sequence of Crm1/exportin 1 mutant alleles reveals critical sites
associated with multidrug resistance.";
"Cloning of caf1+, caf2+ and caf4+ from Schizosaccharomyces pombe:
their involvement in multidrug resistance, UV and pH sensitivity.";

-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for the leucine-rich nuclear export signal
    (NES).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Note=Localized in the nucleus and
    at its periphery.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Cellular target of leptomycin B (LMB), a nuclear
    export inhibitor. LMB alkylates Cys-529 leading to CRM1
    inactivation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the exportin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 importin N-terminal domain.
