DNA translocase ftsK.
"Analysis of the chromosome sequence of the legume symbiont
Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA motor protein, which is both required to move DNA
    out of the region of the septum during cell division and for the
    septum formation. Tracks DNA in an ATP-dependent manner by
    generating positive supercoils in front of it and negative
    supercoils behind it (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homohexamer. This suggests the formation of a ring
    between the two cells at the septum that surrounds DNA (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein; cytoplasmic side. Note=Located at the septum. The large
    C-terminal part of the protein is cytoplasmic (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 FtsK domain.
