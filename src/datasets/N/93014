AC   Q71WU5;
Prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (EC 2.4.99.-).
"Whole genome comparisons of serotype 4b and 1/2a strains of the food-
borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes reveal new insights into the
core genome components of this species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transfers the N-acyl diglyceride group on what will
    become the N-terminal cysteine of membrane lipoproteins (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Lipoprotein biosynthesis; first step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Probable).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the lgt family.
