AC   Q5XC26;
Tyrosine recombinase xerC.
"Progress toward characterization of the group A Streptococcus
metagenome: complete genome sequence of a macrolide-resistant serotype
M6 strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Site-specific tyrosine recombinase, which acts by
    catalyzing the cutting and rejoining of the recombining DNA
    molecules. The xerC-xerD complex is essential to convert dimers of
    the bacterial chromosome into monomers to permit their segregation
    at cell division (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: May act by forming a cyclic heterotetrameric complex
    composed of two molecules of xerC and two molecules of xerD (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the "phage" integrase family. XerC type 2
    subfamily.
