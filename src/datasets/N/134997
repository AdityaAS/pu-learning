Pulmonary surfactant-associated protein B (SP-B) (6 kDa protein)
(Pulmonary surfactant-associated proteolipid SPL(Phe)).
"Protein sequence analysis studies on the low molecular weight
hydrophobic proteins associated with bovine pulmonary surfactant.";
"Characterization of the small hydrophobic proteins associated with
pulmonary surfactant.";
-!- FUNCTION: Pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins promote
    alveolar stability by lowering the surface tension at the air-
    liquid interface in the peripheral air spaces. SP-B increases the
    collapse pressure of palmitic acid to nearly 70 millinewtons per
    meter.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer; disulfide-linked.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein; extracellular space.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Pulmonary surfactant consists of 90% lipid and 10%
    protein. There are 4 surfactant-associated protein: 2 collagenous,
    carbohydrate-binding glycoproteins (SP-A and SP-D) and 2 small
    hydrophobic proteins (SP-B and SP-C).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 saposin B-type domain.
