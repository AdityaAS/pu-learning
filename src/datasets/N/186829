-!- FUNCTION: Ring cleavage of cyclic ester dienelactone to produce
    maleylacetate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4-carboxymethylenebut-2-en-4-olide + H(2)O =
    4-oxohex-2-enedioate.
-!- PATHWAY: Aromatic compound metabolism; 3-chlorocatechol
    degradation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Carboxymethylenebutenolidase is specific for
    dienelactone and has no activity toward enol-lactones.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dienelactone hydrolase family.
