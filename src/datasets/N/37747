flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: This enzyme catalyzes the 6-electron reduction of
    sulfite to sulfide. This is one of several activities required for
    the biosynthesis of L-cysteine from sulfate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: H(2)S + 3 NADP(+) + 3 H(2)O = sulfite + 3
    NADPH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 siroheme per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Alpha(8)-beta(4). The alpha component is a flavoprotein,
    the beta component is a hemoprotein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nitrite and sulfite reductase 4Fe-4S
    domain family.
