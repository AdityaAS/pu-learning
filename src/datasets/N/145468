Calpain-like protease 1 (EC 3.4.22.-) (Cysteine protease RIM13)
(Calpain-7) (Regulator of IME2 protein 13).
"The nucleotide sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
XIII.";
"Proteolytic activation of Rim1p, a positive regulator of yeast
sporulation and invasive growth.";
"The protease activity of a calpain-like cysteine protease in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for alkaline adaptation and

-!- FUNCTION: Required for the proteolytic cleavage of the
    transcriptional repressor RIM101 in response to alkaline ambient
    pH, which is necessary for sporulation and invasive growth.
    Probably the protease that cleaves RIM101.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with SNF7, which may act together with RIM20 as
    a scaffold to recruit RIM13 to its substrate RIM101.
-!- INTERACTION:
    P39929:SNF7; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-27327, EBI-17554;
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 432 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase C2 family. PalB/RIM13
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 calpain catalytic domain.
