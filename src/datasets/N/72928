-!- FUNCTION: Involved in RNA processing and negative regulation of
    glucose repression. Regulates the level of two antigens, P43 and
    P70. Binds to protein phosphatase type 1. Functions with REG2 and
    SNF1 protein kinase to regulate growth. Might regulate SNF1
    directly or indirectly.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 2560 molecules/cell.
