AC   Q6FZE4;
30S ribosomal protein S13.
"The louse-borne human pathogen Bartonella quintana is a genomic
derivative of the zoonotic agent Bartonella henselae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Located at the top of the head of the 30S subunit, it
    contacts several helices of the 16S rRNA. In the 70S ribosome it
    contacts the 23S rRNA (bridge B1a) and protein L5 of the 50S
    subunit (bridge B1b), connecting the 2 subunits; these bridges are
    implicated in subunit movement. Contacts the tRNAs in the A and P-
    sites (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Forms a loose
    heterodimer with protein S19. Forms two bridges to the 50S subunit
    in the 70S ribosome (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S13P family.
