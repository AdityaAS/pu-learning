AC   P56453;
Glycyl-tRNA synthetase alpha chain (EC 6.1.1.14) (Glycine--tRNA ligase
alpha chain) (GlyRS).
"The complete genome sequence of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter
pylori.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + glycine + tRNA(Gly) = AMP + diphosphate
    + glycyl-tRNA(Gly).
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta chains (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
