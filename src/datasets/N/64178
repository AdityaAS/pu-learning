AC   Q6T893;
Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase glpE (EC 2.8.1.1).
"Two TonB systems in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae: their roles in
iron acquisition and virulence.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes, although with low efficiency, the sulfur
    transfer reaction from thiosulfate to cyanide (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Thiosulfate + cyanide = sulfite + thiocyanate.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glpE family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 rhodanese domain.
