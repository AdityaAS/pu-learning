-!- FUNCTION: Regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PLCE1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; cytoplasmic
    side (By similarity). Note=Inner surface of plasma membrane
    possibly with attachment requiring acylation of the C-terminal
    cysteine (By similarity with RAS).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small GTPase superfamily. Ras family.
