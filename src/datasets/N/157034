endonuclease).

-!- FUNCTION: Zinc phosphodiesterase, which displays some tRNA 3'-
    processing endonuclease activity. Probably involved in tRNA
    maturation, by removing a 3' trailer from precursor tRNA (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Endonucleolytic cleavage of RNA, removing
    extra 3' nucleotides from tRNA precursor, generating 3' termini of
    tRNAs. A 3'-hydroxy group is left at the tRNA terminus and a 5'-
    phosphoryl group is left at the trailer molecule.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 zinc ions (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNase Z family.
