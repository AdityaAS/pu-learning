AC   Q66S65;
Mannose-binding protein C precursor (MBP-C) (MBP1) (Mannan-binding
protein) (Mannose-binding lectin).
"Evolution of the mannose-binding lectin gene in primates.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds mannose and N-acetylglucosamine in a calcium-
    dependent manner. Is capable of host defense against pathogens, by
    activating the classical complement pathway independently of the
    antibody (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Oligomeric complex of 6 set of homotrimers. Binds MASP2
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 C-type lectin domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 collagen-like domain.
