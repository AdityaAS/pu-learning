3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 3 (EC 2.3.1.41) (3-oxoacyl-
[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase III) (Beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III)
(KAS III).

pathogenesis of uncomplicated urinary tract infection.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the condensation reaction of fatty acid
    synthesis by the addition to an acyl acceptor of two carbons from
    malonyl-ACP. Catalyzes the first condensation reaction which
    initiates fatty acid synthesis and may therefore play a role in
    governing the total rate of fatty acid production. Possesses both
    acetoacetyl-ACP synthase and acetyl transacylase activities. Its
    substrate specificity determines the biosynthesis of branched-
    chain and/or straight-chain of fatty acids (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + malonyl-[acyl-
    carrier-protein] = 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + CO(2) +
    [acyl-carrier-protein].
-!- PATHWAY: Fatty acid biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- DOMAIN: The last Arg residue of the ACP-binding site is essential
    for the weak association between ACP/acpP and fabH (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the fabH family.
