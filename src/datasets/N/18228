AC   P31570;
Cob(I)yrinic acid a,c-diamide adenosyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.17)
(Cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase) (Corrinoid adenosyltransferase).
"Cloning, sequencing and overexpression of cobA which encodes
ATP:corrinoid adenosyltransferase in Salmonella typhimurium.";
"Complete genome sequence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
LT2.";
"Purification and initial characterization of the ATP:corrinoid
adenosyltransferase encoded by the cobA gene of Salmonella
typhimurium.";
"cobA function is required for both de novo cobalamin biosynthesis and
assimilation of exogenous corrinoids in Salmonella typhimurium.";
"The ATP:Co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase (CobA) enzyme of Salmonella
enterica requires the 2'-OH group of ATP for function and yields
inorganic triphosphate as its reaction byproduct.";
"Three-dimensional structure of ATP:corrinoid adenosyltransferase from
Salmonella typhimurium in its free state, complexed with MgATP, or
complexed with hydroxycobalamin and MgATP.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for both de novo synthesis of the corrin ring
    for the assimilation of exogenous corrinoids. Participates in the
    adenosylation of a variety of incomplete and complete corrinoids.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + cob(I)yrinic acid a,c-diamide =
    triphosphate + adenosylcob(III)yrinic acid a,c-diamide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + cobinamide = triphosphate +
    adenosylcobinamide.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis;
    adenosylcobalamin from cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide: step 2.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase
    family.
