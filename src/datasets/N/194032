Chlamydia trachomatis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Responsible for synthesis of pseudouridine from uracil-
    55 in the psi GC loop of transfer RNAs (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: tRNA uridine = tRNA pseudouridine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pseudouridine synthase truB family.
    Type 1 subfamily.
