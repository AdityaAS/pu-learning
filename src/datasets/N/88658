AC   Q9W6R1;
Phosphorylase b kinase regulatory subunit alpha, liver isoform
(Phosphorylase kinase alpha L subunit).
"Genomic structure and comparative analysis of nine Fugu genes:
conservation of synteny with human chromosome Xp22.2-p22.1.";
-!- FUNCTION: Phosphorylase b kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of
    serine in certain substrates, including troponin I. The alpha
    chain may bind calmodulin (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: By phosphorylation of various serine residues
    and by calcium (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Glycogen metabolism.
-!- SUBUNIT: Polymer of 16 chains, four each of alpha, beta, gamma,
    and delta. Alpha and beta are regulatory chains, gamma is the
    catalytic chain, and delta is calmodulin (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; cytoplasmic
    side (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphorylase b kinase regulatory chain
    family.
