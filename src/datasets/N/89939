Ig kappa chain V region EV15 precursor.
"Aberrant recombination events in B cell lines derived from a kappa-
deficient human.";
"Human plasma N-glycoproteome analysis by immunoaffinity subtraction,
hydrazide chemistry, and mass spectrometry.";
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This sequence does not belong to any of the
    previously described V-kappa subgroups. Although the gene is
    located in the same region as other V-kappa genes, it appears to
    be the only one of its type.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The gene was found to be aberrantly rearranged in
    an individual who does not synthesize any kappa light chains. It
    has not been shown to be expressed.
