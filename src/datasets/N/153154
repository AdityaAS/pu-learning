AC   Q98N57;
50S ribosomal protein L3.
"Complete genome structure of the nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacterium
Mesorhizobium loti.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly near the 3' end of the 23S rRNA, where it nucleates
    assembly of the 50S subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit. Forms a cluster with
    proteins L14 and L19 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L3P family.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
