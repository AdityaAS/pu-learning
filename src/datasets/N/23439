-!- FUNCTION: Provides CDP-diacylglycerol an important precursor for
    the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and
    cardiolipin (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: CTP + phosphatidate = diphosphate + CDP-
    diacylglycerol.
-!- PATHWAY: Phospholipid biosynthesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein; matrix side (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the CDS family.
