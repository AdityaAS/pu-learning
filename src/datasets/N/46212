AC   P03254;
Early E1A 32 kDa protein.
"Structure of two spliced mRNAs from the transforming region of human
subgroup C adenoviruses.";
"Nucleotide sequences from the adenovirus-2 genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Trans-activates early viral promoters and some cellular
    promoters. The tumorigenesis-restraining activity of E1A may be
    related to the disruption of the human CtBP-CtIP complex through
    the CtBP binding motif.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with human UBE2I (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
      Comment=Isoforms are derived from the E1 region of the genome;
    Name=1; Synonyms=Early E1A 32 kDa protein;
