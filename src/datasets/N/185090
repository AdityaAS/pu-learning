AC   P11138;
Trans-activating transcriptional regulatory protein (Immediate early
protein 1) (IE-1).
"Multiple early transcripts and splicing of the Autographa californica
nuclear polyhedrosis virus IE-1 gene.";
"Nucleotide sequence and temporal expression of a baculovirus
regulatory gene.";
"The complete DNA sequence of Autographa californica nuclear
polyhedrosis virus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Regulatory transcriptional protein, which trans-
    activates gene expression from early baculovirus promoters. Can
    also trans-activate its own promoter, suggesting that it is
    autoregulated during normal infection of insect cells.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
      Comment=The spliced form of IE-1 was expressed only in the first
      6 hours postinfection, whereas the nonspliced IE-1 transcript
      was expressed at constant level up to 24 hours;
    Name=Short;
      IsoId=P11138-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=Long;
      IsoId=P11138-2; Sequence=Not described;
      Note=Contains 54 additional residues in the N-terminus. No
      experimental confirmation available;
Alternative splicing; Early protein; Transcription;
