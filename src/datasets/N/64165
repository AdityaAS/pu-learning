-!- FUNCTION: Electron transfer protein; may also function as the
    membrane anchor for the glpAB dimer.
-!- PATHWAY: Lipid metabolism; glycerophospholid metabolism.
-!- SUBUNIT: Composed of a catalytic glpA/B dimer and of glpC.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein. Note=Loosely bound to the cytoplasmic membrane often
    occurring in vesicles associated with fumarate reductase.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 4Fe-4S type ferredoxin domains.
