AC   Q9KRB2;
DNA topoisomerase 1 (EC 5.99.1.2) (DNA topoisomerase I) (Omega-
protein) (Relaxing enzyme) (Untwisting enzyme) (Swivelase).
"DNA sequence of both chromosomes of the cholera pathogen Vibrio
cholerae.";
-!- FUNCTION: The reaction catalyzed by topoisomerases leads to the
    conversion of one topological isomer of DNA to another.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP-independent breakage of single-stranded
    DNA, followed by passage and rejoining.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: When a topoisomerase transiently breaks a DNA
    backbone bond, it simultaneously forms a protein-DNA link, in
    which a tyrosyl oxygen in the enzyme is joined to a DNA phosphorus
    at one end of the enzyme-severed DNA strand.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the prokaryotic type I/III topoisomerase
    family.
