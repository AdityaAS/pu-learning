AC   Q71WB7;
30S ribosomal protein S7.
"Whole genome comparisons of serotype 4b and 1/2a strains of the food-
borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes reveal new insights into the
core genome components of this species.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly to 16S rRNA where it nucleates assembly of the head
    domain of the 30S subunit. Is located at the subunit interface
    close to the decoding center, probably blocks exit of the E-site
    tRNA (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts proteins S9
    and S11 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S7P family.
