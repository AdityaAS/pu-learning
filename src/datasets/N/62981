AC   P72394; Q9RIU5;
Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.27) (ADP-glucose
synthase) (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) (ADPGlc PPase).
"A glgC gene essential only for the first of two spatially distinct
phases of glycogen synthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).";
"Complete genome sequence of the model actinomycete Streptomyces
coelicolor A3(2).";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate =
    diphosphate + ADP-glucose.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycogen biosynthesis; first step.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial/plant glucose-1-phosphate
    adenylyltransferase family.
Complete proteome; Glycogen biosynthesis; Nucleotidyltransferase;
Transferase.
