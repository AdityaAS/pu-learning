AC   Q98I23;
Putative phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide synthase 2
(EC 6.3.2.6) (SAICAR synthetase 2).
"Complete genome structure of the nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacterium
Mesorhizobium loti.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-
    ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxylate + L-aspartate = ADP + phosphate +
    (S)-2-(5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-
    carboxamido)succinate.
-!- PATHWAY: Nucleotide biosynthesis; IMP biosynthesis; 5-amino-1-(5-
    phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide from 2-N-formyl-1-N-(5-
    phospho-D-ribosyl)glycinamide: step 4.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Purine biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SAICAR synthetase family.
Complete proteome; Ligase; Purine biosynthesis.
