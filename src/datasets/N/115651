AC   P60497; Q01825;
NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 6 (EC 1.6.5.3) (NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 6).
"The mitochondrial genome of Arabidopsis thaliana contains 57 genes in
366,924 nucleotides.";
"RNA editing in Arabidopsis mitochondria effects 441 C to U changes in
ORFs.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 2 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NADH + ubiquinone = NAD(+) + ubiquinol.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (Potential).
-!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=9, 18, 30, 32, 35, 54, 57, 64,
    149.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: A stretch of 270 kb of the mitochondrial genome is
    duplicated within the centromer of chromosome 2 resulting in the
    duplication of the gene. The expression of the duplicated gene
    (At2g07731) is not demonstrated. It is also probably not RNA
    edited and therefore differs in all the positions known to be
    edited.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the complex I subunit 6 family.
