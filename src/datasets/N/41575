Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 3 (EC 1.1.-.-) (Retinal short-
chain dehydrogenase/reductase 1) (retSDR1).
"Molecular characterization of a novel short-chain
dehydrogenase/reductase that reduces all-trans-retinal.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-
    trans-retinol in the presence of NADPH (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: In the retina, expressed in cone but not rod
    outer segments.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases
    (SDR) family.
Membrane; NADP; Oxidoreductase; Transmembrane.
