AC   Q9RDD6;
Heat-inducible transcription repressor hrcA.
"Complete genome sequence of the model actinomycete Streptomyces
coelicolor A3(2).";
-!- FUNCTION: Negative regulator of class I heat shock genes (grpE-
    dnaK-dnaJ and groELS operons). Prevents heat-shock induction of
    these operons (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hrcA family.
