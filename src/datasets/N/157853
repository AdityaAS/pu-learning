AC   Q8V4V3;
DNA-directed RNA polymerase 132 kDa polypeptide (EC 2.7.7.6).
"Human monkeypox and smallpox viruses: genomic comparison.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription
    of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as
    substrates.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: This enzyme consists of at least eight subunits.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA polymerase beta chain family.
