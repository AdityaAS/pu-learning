AC   Q6NGI4;
Probable 16S rRNA-processing protein rimM.
"The complete genome sequence and analysis of Corynebacterium
diphtheriae NCTC13129.";
-!- FUNCTION: Essential for efficient processing of 16S rRNA. Probably
    part of the 30S subunit prior to or during the final step in the
    processing of 16S free 30S ribosomal subunits. It could be some
    accessory protein needed for efficient assembly of the 30S
    subunit. It is needed in a step prior to rbfA during the
    maturation of 16S rRNA. It has affinity for free ribosomal 30S
    subunits but not for 70S ribosomes (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the rimM family.
Complete proteome; rRNA processing.
