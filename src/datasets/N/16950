AC   O08839;
Myc box-dependent-interacting protein 1 (Bridging integrator 1)
(Amphiphysin-like protein) (Amphiphysin II).
"Amphiphysin heterodimers: potential role in clathrin-mediated
endocytosis.";
"Clathrin interacts specifically with amphiphysin and is displaced by
dynamin.";
"Crystal structure of the alpha appendage of AP-2 reveals a
recruitment platform for clathrin-coat assembly.";
"Crystal structure of the amphiphysin-2 SH3 domain and its role in the
prevention of dynamin ring formation.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in regulation of synaptic vesicle
    endocytosis. May act as a tumor suppressor and inhibits malignant
    cell transformation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer with AMPH. Binds SH3GLB1 (By similarity).
    Binds to SYNJ1 and DNM1 through its SH3 domain, and to clathrin
    through a region outside of the SH3 domain. Also binds AP2A2.
    Interacts with the N-terminal transactivation domain of MYC in a
    manner requiring the integrity of the conserved MYC box regions 1
    and 2. Interacts with BIN2 (By similarity).
