-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate + D-glyceraldehyde
    3-phosphate = D-ribose 5-phosphate + D-xylulose 5-phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 thiamine pyrophosphate per subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the transketolase family.
