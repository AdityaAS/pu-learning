Transcription factor ste11.
"Schizosaccharomyces pombe ste11+ encodes a transcription factor with
an HMG motif that is a critical regulator of sexual development.";
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
"Large-scale screening of intracellular protein localization in living
fission yeast cells by the use of a GFP-fusion genomic DNA library.";
"Ste11p, a high-mobility-group box DNA-binding protein, undergoes
pheromone- and nutrient-regulated nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling.";
-!- FUNCTION: Key transcription factor for sexual development.
    Activates the transcription of the matp, matm, mei2, mfm, ste6 and
    rgs1 genes. Binds specifically to a DNA fragment carrying a 10-
    base motif 5'-TTCTTTGTTY-3'.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Cytoplasm. Note=Accumulates in the
    nucleus under conditions of nitrogen starvation and in the
    presence of mating pheromones.
-!- INDUCTION: By nitrogen starvation.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylation results in inactivation.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HMG box DNA-binding domain.
