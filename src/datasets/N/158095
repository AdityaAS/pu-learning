dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV).";
-!- FUNCTION: The replicase polyprotein 1ab is a multifunctional
    protein: it contains the activities necessary for the
    transcription of negative stranded RNA, leader RNA, subgenomic
    mRNAs and progeny virion RNA as well as proteinases responsible
    for the cleavage of the polyprotein into functional products.
-!- FUNCTION: The Nsp1 chain is essential for viral subgenomic mRNA
    synthesis (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: The 3C-like serine proteinase chain is responsible for
    the majority of cleavages as it cleaves the C-terminus of the
    polyprotein (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: The helicase chain, which contains a zinc finger
    structure, displays RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding activities with
    5' to 3' polarity (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: N nucleoside triphosphate = N diphosphate +
    {RNA}(N).
-!- DOMAIN: The hydrophobic domains (HD) could mediate the membrane
    association of the replication complex and thereby alter the
    architecture of the host cell membrane (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Specific enzymatic cleavages in vivo by its own proteases
    yield mature proteins. There are two alternative pathways for
    processing. Either nsp4-5 is cleaved, which represents the major
    pathway or the nsp5-6 and nsp6-7 are processed, which represents
    the minor pathway. The major pathway occurs when nsp2 acts as
    cofactor for nsp4 (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The polyprotein 1ab is translated as a 1a-1b
    polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. The 1a
    polyprotein is produced by itself but not the 1b polyprotein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the arteriviruses polyprotein family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase C31 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase C32 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase C33 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase S32 domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RdRp catalytic domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 viral helicase-type-like zinc finger.
