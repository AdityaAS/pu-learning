AC   P54832;
Serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 2 (EC 3.1.1.2) (EC 3.1.8.1) (PON 2)
(Serum aryldialkylphosphatase 2) (A-esterase 2) (Aromatic esterase 2).
"The human serum paraoxonase/arylesterase gene (PON1) is one member of
a multigene family.";
-!- FUNCTION: Hydrolyzes the toxic metabolites of a variety of
    organophosphorus insecticides. Capable of hydrolyzing a broad
    spectrum of organophosphate substrates and a number of aromatic
    carboxylic acid esters.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A phenyl acetate + H(2)O = a phenol + acetate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: An aryl dialkyl phosphate + H(2)O = dialkyl
    phosphate + an aryl alcohol.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: Glycosylated (By similarity).
-!- PTM: The signal sequence is not cleaved (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the paraoxonase family.
