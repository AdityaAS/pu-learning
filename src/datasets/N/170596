AC   O14462;
Ras-related protein SEC4.
"Isolation and characterization of the Candida albicans SEC4 gene.";
"Candida albicans strain 1161 genome pilot sequencing project.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in exocytosis. Maybe by regulating the binding
    and fusion of secretory vesicles with the cell surface. The GTP-
    bound form of SEC4 may interact with an effector, thereby
    stimulating its activity and leading to exocytotic fusion. SEC4
    may be an upstream activator of the 19.5S SEC8/SEC15 particle.
    SEC4 probably interacts directly with SEC8; it could serve as the
    attachment site for the SEC8/SEC15 particle (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic vesicle; secretory vesicle;
    secretory vesicle membrane; lipid-anchor; cytoplasmic side (By
    similarity). Cell membrane; lipid-anchor; cytoplasmic side (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the small GTPase superfamily. Rab family.
