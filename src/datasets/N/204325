AC   Q10749;
Venom metalloproteinase mocarhagin (EC 3.4.24.-) (Fragment).
"Mocarhagin, a novel cobra venom metalloproteinase, cleaves the
platelet von Willebrand factor receptor glycoprotein Ibalpha.
Identification of the sulfated tyrosine/anionic sequence Tyr-276-Glu-
282 of glycoprotein Ibalpha as a binding site for von Willebrand
factor and alpha-thrombin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Zinc protease that inhibits fibrinogen interaction with
    platelet receptors expressed on glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex.
    Acts by binding to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor on the
    platelet surface and inhibits aggregation induced by Von
    willibrand factor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed by the venom gland.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 peptidase M12B domain.
