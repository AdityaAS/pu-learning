AC   Q8SR75;
DNA-directed RNA polymerase II polypeptide 2 (EC 2.7.7.6) (RNA
polymerase II subunit 2).
"Genome sequence and gene compaction of the eukaryote parasite
Encephalitozoon cuniculi.";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription
    of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as
    substrates.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate
    + RNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: RNA polymerase II consists of 12 different subunits. This
    subunit is the second largest component of RNA polymerase II (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Three distinct zinc-containing RNA polymerases are
    found in eukaryotic nuclei: polymerase I for the ribosomal RNA
    precursor, polymerase II for the mRNA precursor, and polymerase
    III for 5S and tRNA genes.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RNA polymerase beta chain family.
