expressed in ventricle 1) (CDV-1 protein).
"Genomic organization and mapping of mouse CDV (carnitine deficiency-
associated gene expressed in ventricle)-1 and its related CDV-1R
gene.";
"Identification of human CDV-1R and mouse Cdv-1R, two novel proteins
with putative signal peptides, especially highly expressed in testis
and increased with the male sex maturation.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"Complete sequencing and characterization of 21,243 full-length human
cDNAs.";
-!- FUNCTION: Isoform CDV-1 may be involved in cardiac hypertrophy
    caused by carnitine deficiency. Isoform CDV-1R appears to play a
    role in development of the testis and spermatogenesis (By
    similarity).

-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in testis, moderately in
    ovary, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney and pancreas, low in
    prostate, brain, placenta and lung and not detected in spleen,
    thymus, small intestine and colon. Isoform CDV-1R is abundantly
    expressed in testis.
