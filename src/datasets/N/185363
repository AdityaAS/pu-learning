AC   P02553;
Tubulin alpha chain (Fragment).
"Evolution of alpha q- and beta-tubulin genes as inferred by the
nucleotide sequences of sea urchin cDNA clones.";
-!- FUNCTION: Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules. It
    binds two moles of GTP, one at an exchangeable site on the beta
    chain and one at a non-exchangeable site on the alpha-chain.
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimer of alpha and beta chains.
-!- PTM: Undergoes a tyrosination/detyrosination cycle, the cyclic
    removal and re-addition of a C-terminal tyrosine residue by the
    enzymes tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase (TTCP) and tubulin
    tyrosine ligase (TTL), respectively (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the tubulin family.
GTP-binding; Microtubule; Nucleotide-binding.
