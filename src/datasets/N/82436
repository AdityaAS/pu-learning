AC   Q5HRJ8;
Probable branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.42)
(BCAT).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts on leucine, isoleucine and valine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-leucine + 2-oxoglutarate = 4-methyl-2-
    oxopentanoate + L-glutamate.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-isoleucine biosynthesis; L-
    isoleucine from 2-oxobutanoate: step 4 [final step].
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-leucine biosynthesis; L-
    leucine from 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate: step 4 [final step].
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-valine biosynthesis; L-valine
    from pyruvate: step 4 [final step].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-IV pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
    aminotransferase family.
