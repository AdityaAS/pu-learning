AC   Q8U0C0;
3-isopropylmalate dehydratase large subunit 2 (EC 4.2.1.33)
(Isopropylmalate isomerase 2) (Alpha-IPM isomerase 2) (IPMI 2).
"The complete sequence of the Pyrococcus furiosus genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the isomerization between 2-isopropylmalate
    and 3-isopropylmalate, via the formation of 2-isopropylmaleate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (2R,3S)-3-isopropylmalate = (2S)-2-
    isopropylmaleate + H(2)O.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (2S)-2-isopropylmaleate + H(2)O = 3-hydroxy-4-
    methyl-3-carboxypentanoate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-leucine biosynthesis; L-
    leucine from 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate: step 2.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of leuC and leuD (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aconitase/IPM isomerase family. LeuC
    type 2 subfamily.
