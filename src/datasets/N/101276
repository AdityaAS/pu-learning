AC   Q6NVC5; Q803L2;
Mitochondrial Rho GTPase 1 (EC 3.6.5.-) (MIRO-1) (Ras homolog gene
family member T1).
-!- FUNCTION: Mitochondrial GTPase involved in mitochondrial
    trafficking. Probably involved in control of anterograde transport
    of mitochondria and their subcellular distribution (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial outer membrane;
    single-pass type IV membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the mitochondrial Rho GTPase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 EF-hand domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 Miro domains.
