AC   P19210;
Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (EC 3.2.2.23) (FAPY-DNA
glycosylase) (DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase mutM)
(EC 4.2.99.18) (AP lyase mutM).
"Nucleotide sequence of a gene from alkaliphilic Bacillus firmus RAB
that is homologous to the fpg gene of Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in base excision repair of DNA damaged by
    oxidation or by mutagenic agents. Acts as DNA glycosylase that
    recognizes and removes damaged bases. Has a preference for
    oxidized purines, such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). Has
    AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lyase activity and introduces nicks in
    the DNA strand. Cleaves the DNA backbone by beta-delta elimination
    to generate a single-strand break at the site of the removed base
    with both 3'- and 5'-phosphates (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of DNA containing ring-opened 7-N-
    methylguanine residues, releasing 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-(N-
    methyl)formamidopyrimidine.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: The C-O-P bond 3' to the apurinic or
    apyrimidinic site in DNA is broken by a beta-elimination reaction,
    leaving a 3'-terminal unsaturated sugar and a product with a
    terminal 5'-phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the FPG family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 FPG-type zinc finger.
