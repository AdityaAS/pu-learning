Probable signal peptidase complex subunit 3 (EC 3.4.-.-) (Microsomal
signal peptidase 22 kDa subunit) (SPase 22 kDa subunit) (SPC22).
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 3 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
"Full-length cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana.";
-!- FUNCTION: Microsomal signal peptidase is a membrane-bound
    endoproteinase that removes signal peptides from nascent proteins
    as they are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic
    reticulum (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Complex of five different proteins: SEC11L1, SEC11L3,
    SPCS1, SPCS2 and SPCS3 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Microsome; microsomal membrane; single-pass
    type II membrane protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SPCS3 family.
