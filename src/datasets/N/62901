-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of the alpha-1,6-glucosidic
    linkages in glycogen by scission of a 1,4-alpha-linked
    oligosaccharide from growing alpha-1,4-glucan chains and the
    subsequent attachment of the oligosaccharide to the alpha-1,6
    position (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Transfers a segment of a 1,4-alpha-D-glucan
    chain to a primary hydroxy group in a similar glucan chain.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycogen biosynthesis; third step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- INTERACTION:
    P52231:trxA; NbExp=1; IntAct=EBI-862111, EBI-862916;
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 13 family.
 GO:0005515; F:protein binding; IPI:IntAct.
