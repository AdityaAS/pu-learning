N-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase (EC 1.2.1.38) (AGPR) (N-
acetyl-glutamate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) (NAGSA dehydrogenase).
"The arginine operon of Bacillus stearothermophilus: characterization
of the control region and its interaction with the heterologous B.
subtilis arginine repressor.";
"Primary structure, partial purification and regulation of key enzymes
of the acetyl cycle of arginine biosynthesis in Bacillus
stearothermophilus: dual function of ornithine acetyltransferase.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: N-acetyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde + NADP(+)
    + phosphate = N-acetyl-5-glutamyl phosphate + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-arginine biosynthesis; 2-N-
    acetyl-L-ornithine from L-glutamate: step 3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- INDUCTION: Expression of the argCJBD operon is regulated by argR.
    This binding is arginine dependent.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NAGSA dehydrogenase family. Type 1
    subfamily.
 GO:0009085; P:lysine biosynthesis; IEA:HAMAP.
