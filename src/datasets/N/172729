AC   Q5R8K3;
SRA stem-loop-interacting RNA-binding protein, mitochondrial
precursor.
-!- FUNCTION: RNA-binding protein that acts as a nuclear receptor
    corepressor. Probably acts by binding the SRA RNA, and repressing
    the SRA-mediated nuclear receptor coactivation. Binds the STR7
    loop of SRA RNA. Also able to repress glucocorticoid (GR),
    androgen (AR), thyroid (TR) and VDR-mediated transactivation (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity). Note=Predominantly mitochondrial. Some fraction is
    nuclear. In the nucleus, it is recruited to nuclear receptor
    target promoters (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RRM (RNA recognition motif) domain.
