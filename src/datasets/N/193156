AC   Q9PDK4;
Tryptophan synthase beta chain (EC 4.2.1.20).
"The genome sequence of the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa.";
-!- FUNCTION: The beta subunit is responsible for the synthesis of L-
    tryptophan from indole and L-serine.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-serine + 1-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate
    = L-tryptophan + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-tryptophan biosynthesis; L-
    tryptophan from chorismate: step 5 [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Tetramer of two alpha and two beta chains (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the trpB family.
