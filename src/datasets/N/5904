AC   Q9JHX6;
Probable allantoicase (EC 3.5.3.4) (Allantoate amidinohydrolase).
"Molecular cloning of mouse allantoicase cDNA.";
"Genomic organization and chromosome localization of the murine and
human allantoicase gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: The function of this enzyme is unclear as allantoicase
    activity is not known to exist in mammals.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Allantoate + H(2)O = (S)-ureidoglycolate +
    urea.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the allantoicase family.
 GO:0004037; F:allantoicase activity; IEA:EC.
