Protein citXG [Includes: Apo-citrate lyase phosphoribosyl-dephospho-
CoA transferase (EC 2.7.7.61) (Holo-ACP synthase) (Holo-citrate lyase
synthase) (Apo-ACP nucleodityltransferase); 2-(5''-triphosphoribosyl)-

triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA synthase)].
"Cloning and molecular characterization of the citrate utilization
citMCDEFGRP cluster of Leuconostoc paramesenteroides.";
-!- FUNCTION: Bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes formation of 2-(5''-
    triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephosphocoenzyme-A, and then the transfer
    of this prosthetic group precursor to the apo-acyl carrier protein
    (gamma chain) of the citrate lyase to yield the holo-acyl carrier
    protein (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2'-(5''-triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA +
    apo-citrate lyase = holo-citrate lyase + diphosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 3-dephospho-CoA = 2'-(5''-
    triphosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA + adenine.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the citX family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the citG/mdcB
    family.
