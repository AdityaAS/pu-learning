ribosomal proteins S27a and L40.";

-!- FUNCTION: Protein modifier which can be covalently attached to
    target lysines either as a monomer or as a lysine-linked polymer.
    Attachment to proteins as a Lys-48-linked polymer usually leads to
    their degradation by proteasome. Attachment to proteins as a
    monomer or as an alternatively linked polymer does not lead to
    proteasomal degradation and may be required for numerous
    fonctions, including maintenance of chromatin structure,
    regulation of gene expression, stress response, ribosome
    biogenesis and DNA repair (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus.
-!- PTM: Several types of polymeric chains can be formed, depending on
    the lysine used for the assembly (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Ubiquitin is synthesized as a polyubiquitin
    precursor with exact head to tail repeats, the number of repeats
    differ between species and strains. In some species there is a
    final amino-acid after the last repeat, here in rat a Tyr. Some
    ubiquitin genes contain a single copy of ubiquitin fused to a
    ribosomal protein (either L40 or S27a).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ubiquitin family.
