Charged multivesicular body protein 3 (Chromatin-modifying protein 3)
(Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 24).
"Characterization of 954 bovine full-CDS cDNA sequences.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is required
    for multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of
    endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. The MVB pathway mediates
    delivery of transmembrane proteins into the lumen of the lysosome
    for degradation. The ESCRT-III complex is probably involved in the
    concentration of MVB cargo. Required for sorting/trafficking of
    EGF receptor (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the endosomal sorting required for transport
    complex III (ESCRT-III), at least composed of CHMP1A, CHMP1B,
    CHMP2A, CHMP2B, CHMP3/VPS24, CHMP4A/SHAX2, CHMP4B/SHAX1,
    CHMP4C/SHAX3, CHMP5/SNF7DC2 and CHMP6/VPS20. In the complex, it
    interacts directly with CHMP2A and CHMP4A. ATP-dependent
    disassembly of the ESCRT-III complex. Selectively binds to
    phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) and
    PtdIns(3,4)P2 in preference to other phosphoinositides tested (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm; cytosol. Membrane; lipid-anchor.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SNF7 family.
