AC   P33573;
Fibrinogen alpha-2 chain precursor [Contains: Fibrinopeptide A].
"cDNA sequence of a second fibrinogen alpha chain in lamprey: an
archetypal version alignable with full-length beta and gamma chains.";
-!- FUNCTION: Fibrinogen has a double function: yielding monomers that
    polymerize into fibrin and acting as a cofactor in platelet
    aggregation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterohexamer; disulfide linked. Contains 2 sets of 3
    non-identical chains (alpha, beta and gamma). The 2 heterotrimers
    are in head to head conformation with the N-termini in a small
    central domain (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- DOMAIN: A long coiled coil structure formed by 3 polypeptide
    chains connects the central nodule to the C-terminal domains
    (distal nodules). The long C-terminal ends of the alpha chains
    fold back, contributing a fourth strand to the coiled coil
    structure.
-!- PTM: Conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin is triggered by thrombin,
    which cleaves fibrinopeptides A and B from alpha and beta chains,
    and thus exposes the N-terminal polymerization sites responsible
    for the formation of the soft clot. The soft clot is converted
    into the hard clot by factor XIIIA which catalyzes the epsilon-
    (gamma-glutamyl)lysine cross-linking between gamma chains
    (stronger) and between alpha chains (weaker) of different
    monomers.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 fibrinogen C-terminal domain.
