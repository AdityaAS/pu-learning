-!- FUNCTION: Component of the adaptor complexes which link clathrin
    to receptors in coated vesicles. Clathrin-associated protein
    complexes are believed to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of
    membrane proteins, leading to their selection and concentration.
    AP50 is a subunit of the plasma membrane adaptor. The complex
    binds polyphosphoinositide-containing lipids.
-!- SUBUNIT: Adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) is an heterotetramer
    composed of two large adaptins (alpha1A/AP2A1 or alpha1B/AP2A1 or
    alpha2/AP2A2 and beta1/AP2B1), a medium adaptin (mu2/AP2M1) and a
    small adaptin (sigma2long/AP2S1 or sigma2short/AP2S1). Interacts
    with ATP6V1H (By similarity).

-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; coated pit; cytoplasmic side.
    Note=Component of the coat surrounding the cytoplasmic face of
    coated vesicles in the plasma membrane.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Detected in brain.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adaptor complexes medium subunit
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 MHD (mu homology) domain.
