AC   Q5RCF7; Q5R7M6; Q5RF44;
PDZ domain-containing protein 1 (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory
factor 3) (Sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor 3).
-!- FUNCTION: A scaffold protein that connects plasma membrane
    proteins and regulatory components, regulating their surface
    expression in epithelial cells apical domains. May be involved in
    the coordination of a diverse range of regulatory processes for
    ion transport and second messenger cascades. In complex with
    SLC9A3R1, may cluster proteins that are functionally dependent in
    a mutual fashion and modulate the trafficking and the activity of
    the associated membrane proteins. May play a role in the cellular
    mechanisms associated with multidrug resistance through its
    interaction with ABCC2 and PDZK1IP1. May potentiate the CFTR
    chloride channel activity. May function to connect SCARB1 with the
    cellular machineries for intracellular cholesterol transport
    and/or metabolism. May be involved in the regulation of proximal
    tubular Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransport therefore
    playing an important role in tubule function (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PDZK1IP1 and ABCC2. Binds to the C-
    terminal region of SLC26A3. Interacts via its PDZ1 domain with the
    C-terminal domain of SCARB1. Forms a heterodimeric complex with
    SLC9A3R1. Interacts with AKAP2, BCR, CFTR, SLCO1A1, SLC22A12,
    SLC22A4, SLC22A5, SLC26A6, SLC9A3R2 and SLC17A1 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Membrane;
    peripheral membrane protein (By similarity). Note=Associated with
    peripheral membranes. Localizes to the apical compartment of
    proximal tubular cells and to sinusoidal liver membranes (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The PDZ 2 and 3 domains seem to be involved in the
    interaction with SLC26A3 (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Interaction with the C-terminus of CFTR could be mediated
    through independent binding of PDZ 1, 3 and 4 domains (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The PDZ 1 and 3 domains seem to be involved in the
    interaction with SLCO1A1 (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The PDZ 1 domain interacts with BCR (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the NHER family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 PDZ (DHR) domains.
Repeat.
