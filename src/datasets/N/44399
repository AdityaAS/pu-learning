AC   Q19366;
Probable DNA polymerase delta small subunit (EC 2.7.7.7).
"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for
investigating biology.";
-!- FUNCTION: The function of the small subunit is not yet clear.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNA(n) =
    diphosphate + DNA(n+1).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer with subunits of 125 kDa and 50 kDa (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA polymerase delta/II small subunit
    family.
