-!- FUNCTION: Activates the transcription of the soxS gene which
    itself controls the superoxide response regulon. SoxR contains a
    2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster that may act as a redox sensor system
    that recognizes superoxide. The variable redox state of the Fe-S
    cluster is employed in vivo to modulate the transcriptional
    activity of soxR in response to specific types of oxidative
    stress. Upon reduction of 2Fe-2S cluster, SoxR reversibly loses
    its transcriptional activity, but retains its DNA binding affinity
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HTH merR-type DNA-binding domain.
