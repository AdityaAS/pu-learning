AC   Q759D1;
Ribosome biogenesis protein RLP24.
"The Ashbya gossypii genome as a tool for mapping the ancient
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the biogenesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit.
    Ensures the docking of NOG1 to pre-60S particles (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Associated with nucleolar and cytoplasmic pre-60S
    particles. At the end of biogenesis it dissociates from
    cytoplasmic pre-60S particles and is likely to be exchanged for
    its ribosomal homologue, RPL24 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus; nucleolus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L24e family.
