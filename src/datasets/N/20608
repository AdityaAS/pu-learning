AC   P78619; Q5AQU1;
Catalase B precursor (EC 1.11.1.6).
"Two divergent catalase genes are differentially regulated during
Aspergillus nidulans development and oxidative stress.";
"Sequencing of Aspergillus nidulans and comparative analysis with A.
fumigatus and A. oryzae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Occurs in almost all aerobically respiring organisms and
    serves to protect cells from the toxic effects of hydrogen
    peroxide.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 H(2)O(2) = O(2) + 2 H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Heme group.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Barely detectable in asexual spores
    (conidia), disappears after germination, and starts to accumulate
    10 hours after spore inoculation, throughout growth and
    conidiation.
-!- INDUCTION: By hydrogen peroxide, heat shock, paraquat, or uric
    acid catabolism but not by osmotic stress.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the catalase family.
