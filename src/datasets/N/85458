-!- FUNCTION: Histone demethylase that specifically demethylates 'Lys-
    9' of histone H3, thereby playing a central role in histone code.
    Demethylation of Lys residue generates formaldehyde and succinate.
    May have tumor suppressor activity.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 Fe(2+) ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=3;
    Name=1;
      IsoId=Q7LBC6-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=2;
      IsoId=Q7LBC6-2; Sequence=VSP_018299, VSP_018300;
    Name=3;
      IsoId=Q7LBC6-3; Sequence=VSP_018298;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous. Highly expressed in placenta,
    skeletal muscle, kidney, heart and liver.
-!- DOMAIN: Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Leu (LXXLL) motifs are known to mediate
    the association with nuclear receptors (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Its gene is located in the 5q region of the genome
    which is deleted in del(5q) interstitial deletion, a frequent
    deletion found in myeloid leukemias and myelodysplasias,
    suggesting that it may be a good candidate for the del(5q) tumor
    suppressor gene.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the JHDM2 histone demethylase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 JmjC domain.
