AC   O36639;
Movement protein (MP) (Protein 3A).
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in transport of the virus from the initially
    infected cells to adjacent cells, binds to the cell wall.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell junction; plasmodesma (By similarity).
    Note=Assembles into long tubular structures at the surface of the
    infected protoplast (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The virus has a tripartite genome (RNA1, RNA2 and
    RNA3) and an encapsidated subgenomic RNA (RNA4) from which the
    coat protein is expressed. Virions are icosahedral, not enveloped,
    with 32 capsomers per nucleocapsid.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cucumoviruses/bromoviruses 3A family.
Transport; Viral movement protein.
