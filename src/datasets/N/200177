AC   Q5PG52;
UvrABC system protein B (Protein uvrB) (Excinuclease ABC subunit B).
"Comparison of genome degradation in Paratyphi A and Typhi, human-
restricted serovars of Salmonella enterica that cause typhoid.";
-!- FUNCTION: The UvrABC repair system catalyzes the recognition and
    processing of DNA lesions. A damage recognition complex composed
    of 2 uvrA and 2 uvrB subunits scans DNA for abnormalities. Upon
    binding of the uvrA(2)B(2) complex to a putative damaged site, the
    DNA wraps around one uvrB monomer. DNA wrap is dependent on ATP
    binding by uvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA
    helix, facilitating insertion of uvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA
    strands. Then uvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a
    lesion. If a lesion is found the uvrA subunits dissociate and the
    uvrB-DNA preincision complex is formed. This complex is
    subsequently bound by uvrC and the second uvrB is released. If no
    lesion is found, the DNA wraps around the other uvrB subunit that
    will check the other stand for damage (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a heterotetramer with uvrA during the search for
    lesions. Interacts with uvrC in an incision complex (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The beta-hairpin motif is involved in DNA binding (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the uvrB family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase C-terminal domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 UVR domain.
