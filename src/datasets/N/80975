AC   Q9AXQ5;
Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-2 (eIF-5A-2).
"Isolation and characterization of senescence-induced cDNAs encoding
deoxyhypusine synthase and eucaryotic translation initiation factor 5A
from tomato.";
-!- FUNCTION: The precise role of eIF-5A in protein biosynthesis is
    not known but it functions by promoting the formation of the first
    peptide bond.
-!- PTM: eIF-5A seems to be the only eukaryotic protein to have an
    hypusine residue which is a post-translational modification of a
    lysine by the addition of a butylamino group (from spermidine).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the eIF-5A family.
