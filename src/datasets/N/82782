AC   P04088; Q8MIM0;
Inhibin beta B chain precursor (Activin beta-B chain).
"Molecular cloning of the porcine inhibin-beta B precursor subunit
gene and reassignment to chromosome 15.";
"Complementary DNA sequences of ovarian follicular fluid inhibin show
precursor structure and homology with transforming growth factor-
beta.";
"Isolation and characterization of native activin B.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibins and activins inhibit and activate,
    respectively, the secretion of follitropin by the pituitary gland.
    Inhibins/activins are involved in regulating a number of diverse
    functions such as hypothalamic and pituitary hormone secretion,
    gonadal hormone secretion, germ cell development and maturation,
    erythroid differentiation, insulin secretion, nerve cell survival,
    embryonic axial development or bone growth, depending on their
    subunit composition. Inhibins appear to oppose the functions of
    activins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Dimeric, linked by one or more disulfide bonds. Inhibin A
    is a dimer of alpha and beta-A. Inhibin B is a dimer of alpha and
    beta-B. Activin A is a homodimer of beta-A. Activin B is a
    homodimer of beta-B. Activin AB is a dimer of beta-A and beta-B.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TGF-beta family.
