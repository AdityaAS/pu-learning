AC   P47458;
Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) (PK).
"The minimal gene complement of Mycoplasma genitalium.";
"A survey of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome by using random
sequencing.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + pyruvate = ADP + phosphoenolpyruvate.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium.
-!- COFACTOR: Potassium.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Regulated by phosphoenolpyruvate substrate and
    is allosterically activated by ribose-5-phosphate, AMP and other
    nucleoside monophosphates but not by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; pyruvate from D-
    glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate: step 5 [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the pyruvate kinase family.
