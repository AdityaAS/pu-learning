AC   O33481;
Modification methylase PspPI (EC 2.1.1.37) (Cytosine-specific
methyltransferase PspPI) (M.PspPI).
"Cloning and characterization of the gene encoding PspPI
methyltransferase from the Antarctic psychrotroph Psychrobacter sp.
strain TA137. Predicted interactions with DNA and organization of the
variable region.";
-!- FUNCTION: This methylase recognizes the double-stranded sequence
    GGNCC, causes specific methylation on C-4 on both strands, and
    protects the DNA from cleavage by the PspPI endonuclease.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + DNA = S-adenosyl-L-
    homocysteine + DNA containing 5-methylcytosine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the C5-methyltransferase family.
 GO:0003886; F:DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase activity; IEA:EC.
