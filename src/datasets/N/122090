AC   P11486;
Polymerase basic protein 2 (RNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit P3).
"Evolution of influenza polymerase: nucleotide sequence of the PB2
gene of A/Chile/1/83 (H1 N1).";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in transcription initiation and cap-stealing
    mechanism, in which cellular capped pre-mRNA are used to generate
    primers for viral transcription. Binds the cap of the target pre-
    RNA which is subsequently cleaved by PB1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Influenza RNA polymerase is composed of three subunits:
    PB1, PB2 and PA.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the influenza viruses PB2 family.
mRNA capping; mRNA processing.
