N(2),N(2)-dimethylguanosine tRNA methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.32)
(tRNA(guanine-26,N(2)-N(2)) methyltransferase) (tRNA 2,2-
dimethylguanosine-26 methyltransferase)
(tRNA(m(2,2)G26)dimethyltransferase).
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Dimethylates a single guanine residue at position 26 of
    most tRNAs using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as donor of the methyl
    groups (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA = S-adenosyl-L-
    homocysteine + tRNA containing 2-N-methylguanine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TRM1 family.
Methyltransferase; S-adenosyl-L-methionine; Transferase;
