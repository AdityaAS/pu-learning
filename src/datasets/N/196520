AC   Q6G577;
Ubiquinone/menaquinone biosynthesis methyltransferase ubiE
(EC 2.1.1.-).
"The louse-borne human pathogen Bartonella quintana is a genomic
derivative of the zoonotic agent Bartonella henselae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Methyltransferase required for the conversion of
    dimethylmenaquinone (DMKH2) to menaquinone (MKH2) and the
    conversion of 2-polyprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol (DDMQH2) to
    2-polyprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol (DMQH2) (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 2-polyprenyl-6-
    methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol = S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2-
    polyprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + demethylmenaquinol =
    s-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + menaquinol.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; menaquinone biosynthesis;
    menaquinone from chorismate: step 7 [final step].
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; ubiquinone biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily. UbiE
    family.
