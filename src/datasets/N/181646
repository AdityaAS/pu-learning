Protein SYM1.
"The genome of the basidiomycetous yeast and human pathogen
Cryptococcus neoformans.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in cellular response to stress. Required
    to maintain mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity and stability (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial inner membrane;
    multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peroxisomal membrane protein PXMP2/4
    family. MPV17 subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (AAW41425) sequence differs from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
