AC   Q5SCY9;
Light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase iron-sulfur ATP-
binding protein (EC 1.18.-.-) (LI-POR subunit L) (DPOR subunit L).
"The first complete chloroplast genome sequence of a lycophyte,
Huperzia lucidula (Lycopodiaceae).";
-!- FUNCTION: Uses Mg-ATP and reduced ferredoxin to reduce ring D of
    protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to form chlorophyllide a (Chlide)
    (By similarity). This reaction is light-independent.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster per dimer (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Light-independent chlorophyll biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Protochlorophyllide reductase is thought to be composed
    of three subunits; chlL, chlN and chlB. Homodimer of chlL subunit
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nifH/bchL/chlL family.
-!- CAUTION: Arg-129 is present instead of the conserved Cys which is
    one of the two iron-sulfur binding sites.
