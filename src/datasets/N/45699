AC   Q6HG59;
1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase 1 (EC 1.1.1.267) (DXP
reductoisomerase 1) (1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase 1)
(2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate synthase 1).
"Pathogenomic sequence analysis of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus
thuringiensis isolates closely related to Bacillus anthracis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the NADP-dependent rearrangement and reduction
    of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
    4-phosphate (MEP) (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate + NADP(+)
    = 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate + NADPH.
-!- COFACTOR: Divalent cation (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Isoprenoid biosynthesis; isopentenyl-PP biosynthesis via
    DXP pathway; isopentenyl-PP from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:
    step 1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DXR family.
