AC   O16027;
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (EC 1.2.1.12) (GAPDH-1)
(Fragment).
"Cloning of a trans-spliced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase
gene from the potato cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis and
expression of its putative promoter region in Caenorhabditis
elegans.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + phosphate +
    NAD(+) = 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate + NADH.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; pyruvate from D-
    glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
    dehydrogenase family.
Glycolysis; NAD; Oxidoreductase.
