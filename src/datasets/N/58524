AC   Q01558;
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, cytosolic (EC 1.2.1.12)
(GAPDH).
"Molecular analysis of the cytosolic and glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase in Leishmania mexicana.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + phosphate +
    NAD(+) = 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate + NADH.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; pyruvate from D-
    glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
    dehydrogenase family.
Glycolysis; NAD; Oxidoreductase.
