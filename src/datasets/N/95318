AC   Q6GK49;
Antiholin-like protein lrgB.
"Complete genomes of two clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains:
evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance.";
-!- FUNCTION: Inhibits the expression or activity of extracellular
    murein hydrolases by interacting, possibly with lrgB, with the
    holin-like proteins cidA and/or cidB. The lrgAB and cidAB proteins
    may affect the proton motive force of the membrane. May be
    involved in programmed cell death (PCD), possibly triggering PCD
    in response to antibiotics and environmental stresses (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; multi-pass membrane protein
    (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cidB/lrgB family. LrgB subfamily.
