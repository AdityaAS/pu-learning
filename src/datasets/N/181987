(AsnRS).
"Comparative analyses of the complete genome sequences of Pierce's
disease and citrus variegated chlorosis strains of Xylella
fastidiosa.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-asparagine + tRNA(Asn) = AMP +
    diphosphate + L-asparaginyl-tRNA(Asn).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase
    family.
