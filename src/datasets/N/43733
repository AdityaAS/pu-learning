AC   Q8C147; Q6PIS0; Q7TMQ5; Q8K105; Q9DBQ2;
Dedicator of cytokinesis protein 8.
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
-!- FUNCTION: Potential guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GEF
    proteins activate some small GTPases by exchanging bound GDP for
    free GTP (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The DHR-2 domain may mediate some GEF activity (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DOCK family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DHR-2 (CZH-2) domain.
Guanine-nucleotide releasing factor.
