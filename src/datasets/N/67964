Enterococcus faecalis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Synthesizes glutathione from L-glutamate and L-cysteine
    via gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-glutamate + L-cysteine = ADP +
    phosphate + gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine + glycine =
    ADP + phosphate + glutathione.
-!- PATHWAY: Sulfur metabolism; glutathione biosynthesis; glutathione
    from L-cysteine and L-glutamate: step 1.
-!- PATHWAY: Sulfur metabolism; glutathione biosynthesis; glutathione
    from L-cysteine and L-glutamate: step 2 [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the glutamate--
    cysteine ligase type 1 family. Type 2 subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ATP-grasp domain.
