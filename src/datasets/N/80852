AC   Q669Z1;
Translation initiation factor IF-3.
"Insights into the evolution of Yersinia pestis through whole-genome
comparison with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: IF-3 binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and shifts the
    equilibrum between 70S ribosomes and their 50S and 30S subunits in
    favor of the free subunits, thus enhancing the availability of 30S
    subunits on which protein synthesis initiation begins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the IF-3 family.
