AC   Q4WPF7;
Diphthamide biosynthesis protein 4.
"Genomic sequence of the pathogenic and allergenic filamentous fungus
Aspergillus fumigatus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for the first step of diphtamide biosynthesis,
    the transfer of 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl from S-adenosyl-L-
    methionine to a histidine residue. Diphthamide is a post-
    translational modification of histidine which occurs in elongation
    factor 2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Nucleus (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DPH4 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DPH-type zinc finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 J domain.
Complete proteome; Metal-binding; Nuclear protein; Zinc; Zinc-finger.
