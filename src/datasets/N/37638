AC   Q8FEJ0;
Sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit 2 (EC 2.7.7.4) (Sulfate adenylate
transferase) (SAT) (ATP-sulfurylase small subunit).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + sulfate = diphosphate + adenylyl
    sulfate.
-!- PATHWAY: Sulfur metabolism; hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis; sulfite
    from sulfate: step 1.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer composed of cysD, the smaller subunit, and
    cysN (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PAPS reductase family. CysD subfamily.
