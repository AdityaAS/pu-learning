AC   Q8PHY1;
Coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein E (Pyrroloquinoline quinone
biosynthesis protein E).
"Comparison of the genomes of two Xanthomonas pathogens with differing
host specificities.";
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster. The cluster is coordinated with
    3 cysteines and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the radical SAM superfamily. PqqE family.
4Fe-4S; Complete proteome; Iron; Iron-sulfur; Metal-binding;
