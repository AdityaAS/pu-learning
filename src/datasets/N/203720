"Expression and localization of villin, fimbrin, and myosin I in
differentiating mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Ca(2+)-regulated actin-binding protein.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Consists of a large core fragment, the N-terminal portion,
    and a small headpiece, the C-terminal portion. The headpiece binds
    F-actin strongly in both the presence and absence of calcium.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the villin/gelsolin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 gelsolin-like repeats.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HP (headpiece) domain.
