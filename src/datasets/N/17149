AC   Q5HKF3;
6-carboxyhexanoate--CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.14) (Pimeloyl-CoA synthase).
"Insights on evolution of virulence and resistance from the complete
genome analysis of an early methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus strain and a biofilm-producing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus epidermidis strain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transforms pimelate into pimeloyl-CoA (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + 6-carboxyhexanoate + CoA = AMP +
    diphosphate + 6-carboxyhexanoyl-CoA.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; biotin biosynthesis; 6-
    carboxyhexanoyl-CoA from 6-carboxyhexanoate: single step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bioW family.
