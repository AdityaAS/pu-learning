phosphotransmitters implicated in His-to-Asp phosphorelay in

-!- FUNCTION: Functions as two-component phosphorelay mediators
    between cytokinin sensor histidine kinases and response regulators
    (B-type ARRs). Plays an important role in propagating cytokinin
    signal transduction through the multistep His-to-Asp phosphorelay.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with the B-type response regulators ARR1 and
    ARR2.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Predominantly expressed in aerial parts of the
    plant.
-!- DOMAIN: Histidine-containing phosphotransfer domain (HPt) contains
    an active histidine that mediates the phosphotransfer.
-!- PTM: Two-component system major event consists of a His-to-Asp
    phosphorelay between a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and a response
    regulator (RR). In plants, the His-to-Asp phosphorelay involves an
    additionnal intermediate named Histidine-containing
    phosphotransfer protein (HPt). This multistep phosphorelay
    consists of a His-Asp-His-Asp sequential transfer of a phosphate
    group between first an His and an Asp of the HK protein, followed
    by the transfer to a conserved His of the HPt protein and finally
    the transfer to an Asp in the receiver domain of the RR protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HPt domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequences differ from that shown due to erroneous
    gene model prediction.
