52 kDa Ro protein (Sjoegren syndrome type A antigen) (SS-A) (Ro(SS-A))
(52 kDa ribonucleoprotein autoantigen Ro/SS-A) (Tripartite motif-
containing protein 21).
"Structural differences between the human and mouse 52-kD Ro
autoantigens associated with poorly conserved autoantibody activity
across species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Ribonucleoprotein particle composed of a single
    polypeptide and one of four small RNA molecules. It is present in
    all mammalian cells studied but has no known function (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the TRIM/RBCC family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 B box-type zinc finger.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 B30.2/SPRY domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 RING-type zinc finger.
