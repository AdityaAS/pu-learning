-!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator which regulates a genetic
    switch in male development. It is responsible for initiating male
    sex determination. SRY HMG box recognizes DNA by partial
    intercalation in the minor groove.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 HMG box DNA-binding domain.
