"The molecular mechanism of phase variation of H. influenzae
lipopolysaccharide.";
"Tandem repeats of the tetramer 5'-CAAT-3' present in lic2A are
required for phase variation but not lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis
in Haemophilus influenzae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Mediates phase variation of the LOS 6A2 and 12D9
    epitopes. Phase variation of H.influenza LOS epitopes expressed by
    licA is determined by a translational switch.
-!- DOMAIN: Between 2 and 19 copies of the INQS repeats are to be
    found in different strains; these are thought to serve to generate
    phase-variable expression of this gene.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: There is spontaneous, high frequency switching
    between three discrete levels of expression (++++, +, -) of
    oligosaccharide epitopes.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a glycolipid that is a
    necessary component and antigenic determinant of the outer
    membrane and has been shown to be an important factor in the host-
    parasite interaction in a number of Gram-negative species.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: H.influenzae is able to display an extensive
    repertoire of different surface configurations through variability
    of its LOS.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase S49 family.
