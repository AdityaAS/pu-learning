-!- FUNCTION: Protease that can cleave T7 RNA polymerase. Specific for
    paired basic residues.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell outer membrane; multi-pass membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase A26 family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 (AAA27185) sequence differs from that shown due to
    frameshifts in positions 7, 278, 288 and 295.
