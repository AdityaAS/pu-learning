(Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) (Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E3
subunit) (PDC-E3) (E3) (Glycine cleavage system L protein).
"Isolation, characterization, and sequence analysis of a cDNA clone

-!- FUNCTION: Lipoamide dehydrogenase is a component of the glycine
    cleavage system as well as of the alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase
    complexes. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex contains multiple
    copies of three enzymatic components: pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1),
    dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) and lipoamide
    dehydrogenase (E3).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protein 6-N-(dihydrolipoyl)lysine + NAD(+) =
    protein 6-N-(lipoyl)lysine + NADH.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Mitochondrion; mitochondrial matrix.
-!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=49753; MW_ERR=5; METHOD=Electrospray;
    RANGE=32-501; NOTE=Ref.5.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The active site is a redox-active disulfide bond.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-I pyridine nucleotide-disulfide
    oxidoreductase family.
