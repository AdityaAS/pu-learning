AC   Q3KNJ2; Q99JK0; Q9D9U0;
Non-homologous end-joining factor 1 (Protein cernunnos) (XRCC4-like
factor).
"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: DNA repair protein involved in DNA nonhomologous end
    joining (NHEJ) required for double-strand break (DSB) repair and
    V(D)J recombination. May serve as a bridge between XRCC4 and the
    other NHEJ factors located at DNA ends, or may participate in
    reconfiguration of the end bound NHEJ factors to allow XRCC4
    access to the DNA termini (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with XRCC4 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
