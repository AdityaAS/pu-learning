AC   P40418; Q6CUW2;
Regulatory protein SWI6 (Cell-cycle box factor, chain SWI6) (Trans-
acting activator of HO endonuclease gene) (MBF subunit P90).
"A role for the transcription factors Mbp1 and Swi4 in progression
from G1 to S phase.";
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Part of a complex involved in cell-cycle-dependent
    transcription. SWI4 and SWI6 are required for formation of the
    cell-cycle box factor-DNA complex. The repeated element in the
    upstream region of HO (5'-CACGAAAA-3') is called the cell cycle
    box (CCB).
-!- SUBUNIT: MBF contains SWI6 and MBP1; SBF contains SWI6 and SWI4.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 ANK repeats.
Activator; ANK repeat; Complete proteome; DNA-binding; Repeat;
