-!- FUNCTION: Hydrolyzes APD-ribose 1",2"-cyclic phosphate (Appr>1)
    that is produced during tRNA splicing into ADP-ribose 1"-phosphate
    (Appr-1"p). Acts also on nucloside 2',3'-cyclic phosphates.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) at 0.5 mM by 93
    and 87% respectively. Not inhibited by Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Co(2+),
    Ni(2+), and EDTA at 0.5 mM.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=1.35 mM for Appr>p;
      KM=1.34 mM for A>p;
      KM=2.38 mM for C>p;
      KM=16.86 mM for G>p;
      KM=17.67 mM for U>p;
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in leaves, stems, roots, floral buds
    and germinating seeds.
