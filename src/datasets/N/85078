AC   P80747;
Integrin beta-5 (Fragment).
"Bovine PAS-6/7 binds alpha v beta 5 integrins and anionic
phospholipids through two domains.";
-!- FUNCTION: Integrin alpha-V/beta-5 is a receptor for fibronectin.
    It recognizes the sequence R-G-D in its ligand.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of an alpha and a beta subunit. Beta-5
    associates with alpha-V.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the integrin beta chain family.
