AC   Q3B8Q0;
Microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 2.
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in microtubule polymerization, and
    spindle function by stabilizing microtubules and anchoring them at
    centrosomes. May play a role in cell migration (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with DCTN1. Binds to the C-terminal domain of
    APC. Binds monomeric and polymerized tubulin (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Cytoplasm;
    cytoskeleton (By similarity). Note=Associated with the microtubule
    network. Accumulates at the plus end of microtubules (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: Composed of two functionally independent domains. The N-
    terminal domain forms an hydrophobic cleft involved in microtubule
    binding and the C-terminal is involved in the formation of
    mutually exclusive complexes with APC and DCTN1 (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MAPRE family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 CH (calponin-homology) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 EB1 C-terminal domain.
