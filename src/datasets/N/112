AC   O77642;
14-3-3 protein sigma (Stratifin).
"Identification of differentially expressed genes during a wool
follicle growth cycle induced by prolactin.";
-!- FUNCTION: Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large
    spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathway. Binds
    to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a
    phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results
    in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Found in a complex with XPO7, EIF4A1, ARHGAP1,
    VPS26A, VPS29, VPS35 and SFN (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Note=Cytoplasmic
    or may be secreted by a non-classical secretory pathway (By
    similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to be PKC
    activators, but this effect could be non-specific and only due to
    the acidic nature of the protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the 14-3-3 family.
