AC   P80290;
Metallothionein-2C (MT-2C) (Metallothionein-IIC) (MT-IIC).
"Primary structures of seven metallothioneins from rabbit tissue.";
-!- FUNCTION: Metallothioneins have a high content of cysteine
    residues that bind various heavy metals; these proteins are
    transcriptionally regulated by both heavy metals and
    glucocorticoids.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer.
-!- DOMAIN: Class I metallothioneins contain 2 metal-binding domains:
    four divalent ions are chelated within cluster A of the alpha
    domain and are coordinated via cysteinyl thiolate bridges to 11
    cysteine ligands. Cluster B, the corresponding region within the
    beta domain, can ligate three divalent ions to 9 cysteines.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the metallothionein superfamily. Type 1
    family.
