-!- FUNCTION: Forms a receptor complex with neuropilin-1 and can
    propagate semaphorin-3A elicited inhibitory signals into cells and
    neurons.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein (Potential).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in the developing nervous system.
    Widely expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous
    systems. Expressed in the peripheral ganglia, somatosensory,
    olfactory, visual, auditory and equilibrium systems.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the plexin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 IPT/TIG domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 PSI domains.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Sema domain.
