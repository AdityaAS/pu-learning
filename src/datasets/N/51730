Exostosin-2 (EC 2.4.1.224) (EC 2.4.1.225) (Glucuronosyl-N-
acetylglucosaminyl-proteoglycan/N-acetylglucosaminyl-proteoglycan 4-
alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) (Multiple exostoses protein 2
homolog).
"Isolation and characterization of the murine homolog of the human
EXT2 multiple exostoses gene.";
"The structure of the human multiple exostoses 2 gene and
characterization of homologs in mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The putative tumor suppressors EXT1 and EXT2 form a stable complex
that accumulates in the Golgi apparatus and catalyzes the synthesis of
heparan sulfate.";
-!- FUNCTION: Glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of
    heparan-sulfate. The EXT1/EXT2 complex possesses substantially
    higher glycosyltransferase activity than EXT1 or EXT2 alone.
    Appears to be a tumor suppressor.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + beta-D-
    glucuronosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-proteoglycan =
    UDP + N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucuronosyl-
    (1->4)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-proteoglycan.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UDP-alpha-D-glucuronate + N-acetyl-alpha-D-
    glucosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucuronosyl-proteoglycan = UDP + beta-
    D-glucuronosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-
    glucuronosyl-proteoglycan.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycosylation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with GALNT5 (By similarity). Forms a
    homo/hetero-oligomeric complex with EXT1.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; single-pass type II membrane protein. Golgi apparatus;
    Golgi apparatus membrane; single-pass type II membrane protein.
    Note=The EXT1/EXT2 complex is localized in the Golgi apparatus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal
    muscle, kidney and testis.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed in early stages of embryonic
    development.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyltransferase 47 family.
