Large delta antigen (p27) (HDAg-L) [Contains: Small delta antigen
(p24) (HDAg-S)].
"Molecular cloning of hepatitis delta virus RNA from an infected
woodchuck liver: sequence, structure, and applications.";
"Nucleotide sequence analysis of three different hepatitis delta
viruses isolated from a woodchuck and humans.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds specifically to HDV RNA. The large form is
    required for packaging of the HDV ribonucleoprotein with hepatitis
    B surface antigen and inhibits viral RNA replication, whereas the
    small form is required for viral replication.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Prenylation of HDAg-L is required for the assembly of viral
    particles (By similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated (By similarity).
-!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=196; Note=Partially edited. RNA
    editing at this position occurs on the antigenomic strand and
    consists of a conversion of A to G catalyzed by the cellular
    enzyme ADAR1. The unedited RNA version gives rise to the small
    delta antigen, which ends with a nonsense codon at position 196.
    In the edited version, this amber codon is modified to a
    tryptophan codon and gives rise to the large delta antigen
    protein. HDAg-S suppresses editing of non-replicating antigenomic
    RNA, thereby regulating the extent of editing.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The farnesyltransferase inhibitors BZA-5B and FTI-
    277 prevent the production of complete, infectious virions and are
    therefore antiviral agents against HDV (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Binds specifically to antisera from patients with
    chronic hepatitis delta viral infections.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This strain belongs to the genotype I found in
    North America, Europe, Africa, East and West Asia and the South
    Pacific.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the hepatitis delta antigen family.
