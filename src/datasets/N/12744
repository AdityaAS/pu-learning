AC   Q6CBC3;
Autophagy-related protein 7 (Autophagy-related E1-like-activating
enzyme ATG7).
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probable E1-like activating enzyme involved in cytoplasm
    to vacuole transport (Cvt) and autophagy (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The GxGxxG motif is important for the function, possibly
    through binding with ATP (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ATG7 family.
