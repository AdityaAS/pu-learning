Ephrin type-B receptor 1 precursor (EC 2.7.10.1) (Tyrosine-protein
kinase receptor EPH-2) (NET) (HEK6) (ELK).
"cDNA cloning, molecular characterization, and chromosomal
localization of NET(EPHT2), a human EPH-related receptor protein-
tyrosine kinase gene preferentially expressed in brain.";
"Signal peptide prediction based on analysis of experimentally
verified cleavage sites.";
"Ligand activation of ELK receptor tyrosine kinase promotes its
association with Grb10 and Grb2 in vascular endothelial cells.";
-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for members of the ephrin-B family. Binds to
    ephrin-B1, -B2 and -B3. May be involved in cell-cell interactions
    in the nervous system.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a [protein]-L-tyrosine = ADP + a
    [protein]-L-tyrosine phosphate.
-!- SUBUNIT: The ligand-activated form interacts with GRB2, GRB10 and
    NCK through their respective SH2 domains. The GRB10 SH2 domain
    binds EPHB1 through Tyr-928, while GRB2 binds residues within the
    catalytic domain. The NCK SH2 domain binds EPHB1 through Tyr-594.
    Interacts with PRKCABP (By similarity).
