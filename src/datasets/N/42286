AC   Q830N2;
D-alanine--poly(phosphoribitol) ligase subunit 2 (EC 6.1.1.13) (D-
alanyl carrier protein) (DCP).
"Role of mobile DNA in the evolution of vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus faecalis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the biosynthesis of D-alanyl-lipoteichoic
    acid (LTA). Activated D-alanyl-Dcp donates its D-alanyl
    substituent to membrane-associated LTA (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + D-alanine + poly(ribitol phosphate) =
    AMP + diphosphate + O-D-alanyl-poly(ribitol phosphate).
-!- PATHWAY: D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid biosynthesis.
-!- PTM: 4'-phosphopantetheine is transferred from CoA to a specific
    serine of apo-DCP (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 acyl carrier domain.
