AC   Q6LXD3;
30S ribosomal protein S5P.
"Complete genome sequence of the genetically tractable
hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanococcus maripaludis.";
-!- FUNCTION: With S4 and S12 plays an important role in translational
    accuracy (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Contacts protein S4
    (By similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal domain interacts with the head of the 30S
    subunit; the C-terminal domain interacts with the body and
    contacts protein S4. The interaction surface between S4 and S5 is
    involved in control of translational fidelity.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S5P family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 S5 DRBM domain.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
