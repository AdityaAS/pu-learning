Keratin-associated protein 10-3 (Keratin-associated protein 10.3)
(High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.3) (Keratin-associated
protein 18-3) (Keratin-associated protein 18.3).
"A cluster of 21 keratin-associated protein genes within introns of
another gene on human chromosome 21q22.3.";
"The DNA sequence of human chromosome 21.";
"Hair keratin associated proteins: characterization of a second high
sulfur KAP gene domain on human chromosome 21.";
-!- FUNCTION: In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments
    are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair
    keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the
    formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their
    extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine
    residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-
    sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with hair keratins.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Restricted to hair root, not detected in any
    other tissues.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the KRTAP type 10 family.
Keratin; Repeat.
