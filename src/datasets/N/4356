-!- FUNCTION: Beta-adrenergic receptors mediate the catecholamine-
    induced activation of adenylate cyclase through the action of G
    proteins. Beta-3 is involved in the regulation of lipolysis and
    thermogenesis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed mainly in adipose tissues.
-!- POLYMORPHISM: The variant Arg-64 seems to be associated with
    weight gain (obesity) and to is also associated with
    susceptibility to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
