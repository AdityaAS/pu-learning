AC   Q8THA5;
2-isopropylmalate synthase 2 (EC 2.3.3.13) (Alpha-isopropylmalate
synthase 2) (Alpha-IPM synthetase 2).
"The genome of Methanosarcina acetivorans reveals extensive metabolic
and physiological diversity.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the condensation of the acetyl group of
    acetyl-CoA with 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate (2-oxoisovalerate) to form
    3-carboxy-3-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoate (2-isopropylmalate).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Acetyl-CoA + 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + H(2)O =
    (2S)-2-isopropylmalate + CoA.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-leucine biosynthesis; L-
    leucine from 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate: step 1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the alpha-IPM synthetase/homocitrate
    synthase family. LeuA type 1 subfamily.
