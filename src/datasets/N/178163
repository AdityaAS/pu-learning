Cell division inhibitor.
"Evolution of the enterobacterial sulA gene: a component of the SOS
system encoding an inhibitor of cell division.";
-!- FUNCTION: SulA is a component of the SOS system and an inhibitor
    of cell division. Accumulation of sulA causes rapid cessation of
    cell division and the appearance of long, non-septate filaments.
    The expression of sulA is repressed by the lexA protein. FtsZ
    seems to be the target of sulA.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell inner membrane; peripheral membrane
    protein.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The N-terminus of the sulA protein might be
    involved in recognizing the cell division apparatus.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the sulA family.
