AC   Q8YHM4;
50S ribosomal protein L18.
"The genome sequence of the facultative intracellular pathogen
Brucella melitensis.";
-!- FUNCTION: This is one of the proteins that binds and probably
    mediates the attachment of the 5S RNA into the large ribosomal
    subunit, where it forms part of the central protuberance (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 50S ribosomal subunit; part of the 5S
    rRNA/L5/L18/L25 subcomplex. Contacts the 5S and 23S rRNAs (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L18P family.
 GO:0019843; F:rRNA binding; IEA:HAMAP.
