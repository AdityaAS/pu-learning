AC   Q8FBV2;
Tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1) (L-tryptophan indole-lyase) (TNase).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-tryptophan + H(2)O = indole + pyruvate +
    NH(3).
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid degradation; L-tryptophan degradation; indole
    and pyruvate from L-tryptophan: single step [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the beta-eliminating lyase family.
 GO:0006569; P:tryptophan catabolism; IEA:HAMAP.
