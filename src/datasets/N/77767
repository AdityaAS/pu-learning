(TobHypSysB I); HypSysB II (TobHypSysB II)].
"Production of multiple plant hormones from a single polyprotein
precursor.";
"Systemins: a functionally defined family of peptide signals that
regulate defensive genes in Solanaceae species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Activates a lipid-based signal transduction pathway in
    which linolenic acid is converted to jasmonic acid, a potent
    activator of defense gene transcription, including proteinase
    inhibitors.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in leaves.
-!- INDUCTION: By methyl jasmonate in leaves.
-!- PTM: O-glycosylated; contains pentose side chains.
