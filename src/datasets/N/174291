AC   Q7BD17;
Guanine nucleotide exchange factor sopE (Effector protein sopE) (Toxin
sopE).
"Transfer of the Salmonella type III effector sopE between unrelated
phage families.";
-!- FUNCTION: Activator for both CDC42 and RAC1 by directly engaging
    these Rho GTPases and acting as potent guanine nucleotide exchange
    factor (GEF). This activation results in actin cytoskeleton
    rearrangements and stimulates membrane ruffling, promoting
    bacterial entry into non-phagocytic cells (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein (By similarity).
    Note=Secreted via the type III secretion system 1 (SPI-1 TTSS) (By
    similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Encoded within a lambda-like prophage region with
    similarity to GIFSY phages.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GEF (guanine exchange factor) sopE
    family.
GTPase activation; Guanine-nucleotide releasing factor; Virulence.
