Myelin P0 protein precursor (Myelin protein zero) (Myelin peripheral
protein) (MPP).
"Molecular cloning of cDNAs that encode the chicken P0 protein:
evidence for early expression in avians.";
-!- FUNCTION: Creation of an extracellular membrane face which guides
    the wrapping process and ultimately compacts adjacent lamellae.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Found only in peripheral nervous system
    Schwann cells.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the myelin P0 protein family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 Ig-like V-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domain.
