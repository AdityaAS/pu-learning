-!- FUNCTION: Involved in peptide bond synthesis. Stimulates efficient
    translation and peptide-bond synthesis on native or reconstituted
    70S ribosomes in vitro. Probably functions indirectly by altering
    the affinity of the ribosome for aminoacyl-tRNA, thus increasing
    their reactivity as acceptors for peptidyl transferase (By
    similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Protein biosynthesis; polypeptide chain elongation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the elongation factor P family.
