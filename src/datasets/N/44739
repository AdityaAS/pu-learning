AC   P14299;
NAD(+)--dinitrogen-reductase ADP-D-ribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.37)
(ADP-ribosyltransferase).
"Genes coding for the reversible ADP-ribosylation system of
dinitrogenase reductase from Rhodospirillum rubrum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the regulation of the nitrogen fixation
    activity by the reversible ADP-ribosylation of the dinitrogenase
    reductase component of the nitrogenase enzyme complex. The ADP-
    ribosyltransferase (DraT) transfers the ADP-ribose group from NAD
    to dinitrogenase reductase. The ADP-ribose group is removed
    through the action of the ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase (DraG).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: NAD(+) + [dinitrogen reductase] = nicotinamide
    + ADP-D-ribosyl-[dinitrogen reductase].
