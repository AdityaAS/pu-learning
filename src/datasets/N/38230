AC   Q8YD04;
D-amino acid dehydrogenase small subunit (EC 1.4.99.1).
"The genome sequence of the facultative intracellular pathogen
Brucella melitensis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Oxidative deamination of D-amino acids (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A D-amino acid + H(2)O + acceptor = a 2-oxo
    acid + NH(3) + reduced acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: FAD (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a small and a large subunit (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dadA oxidoreductase family.
 GO:0008718; F:D-amino-acid dehydrogenase activity; IEA:HAMAP.
