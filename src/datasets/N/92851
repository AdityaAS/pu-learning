-!- FUNCTION: Promotes intergrin-mediated cell adhesion. May stimulate
    host defense against viruses and tumor cells.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimers and homomultimers. The multimers form ring-
    like structures with a diameter of 30-40 nm. Binds LGALS1 and
    LGALS3. Binds ITGB1, COL4A1, COL5A1, COL6A1, FN1 and NID.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein. Secreted protein;
    extracellular space; extracellular matrix.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous. Detected in body fluids such as
    semen, milk, serum, tears, saliva and urine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 BTB (POZ) domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SRCR domain.
