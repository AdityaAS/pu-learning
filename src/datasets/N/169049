AC   Q8YE49;
Adenosylhomocysteinase (EC 3.3.1.1) (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine
hydrolase) (AdoHcyase).
"The genome sequence of the facultative intracellular pathogen
Brucella melitensis.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + H(2)O = L-
    homocysteine + adenosine.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 NAD per subunit (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; homocysteine biosynthesis; L-
    homocysteine from S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine: single step [final
    step].
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Activated methyl cycle.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adenosylhomocysteinase family.
Complete proteome; Hydrolase; NAD; One-carbon metabolism.
