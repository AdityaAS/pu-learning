AC   Q9CC20;
50S ribosomal protein L20.
"Massive gene decay in the leprosy bacillus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds directly to 23S ribosomal RNA and is necessary for
    the in vitro assembly process of the 50S ribosomal subunit. It is
    not involved in the protein synthesizing functions of that subunit
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L20P family.
