AC   Q9DDD5;
Protein neurobeachin (Fragment).
"Neurobeachin: a protein kinase A-anchoring, beige/Chediak-Higashi
protein homolog implicated in neuronal membrane traffic.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to type II regulatory subunits of protein kinase A
    and anchors/targets them to the membrane. May anchor the kinase to
    cytoskeletal and/or organelle-associated proteins (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with RII subunit of PKA (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity). Membrane;
    peripheral membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Forebrain and cerebellum.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the neurobeachin family.
Membrane.
