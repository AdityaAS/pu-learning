Bifunctional protein tilS/hprT [Includes: tRNA(Ile)-lysidine synthase
(EC 6.3.4.-) (tRNA(Ile)-lysidine synthetase) (tRNA(Ile)-2-lysyl-
cytidine synthase); Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase
(EC 2.4.2.8) (HGPRT) (HGPRTase)].
"Whole genome comparisons of serotype 4b and 1/2a strains of the food-
borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes reveal new insights into the
core genome components of this species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Ligates lysine onto the cytidine present at position 34
    of the AUA codon-specific tRNA(Ile) that contains the anticodon
    CAU, in an ATP-dependent manner. Cytidine is converted to
    lysidine, thus changing the amino acid specificity of the tRNA
    from methionine to isoleucine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: IMP + diphosphate = hypoxanthine + 5-phospho-
    alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: GMP + diphosphate = guanine + 5-phospho-alpha-
    D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per subunit. One of the ions does
    not make direct protein contacts (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- DOMAIN: The N-terminal region contains the highly conserved SGGXDS
    motif, predicted to be a P-loop motif involved in ATP binding.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the N-terminal section; belongs to the tRNA(Ile)-
    lysidine synthase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: In the C-terminal section; belongs to the
    purine/pyrimidine phosphoribosyltransferase family.
