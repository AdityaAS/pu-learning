Flotillin-1.
"Comparative sequencing of human and chimpanzee MHC class I regions
unveils insertions/deletions as the major path to genomic
divergence.";
"Rapid MHC-I evolution generates new disease alleles via hitch-hiking
diversity.";
-!- FUNCTION: May act as a scaffolding protein within caveolar
    membranes, functionally participating in formation of caveolae or
    caveolae-like vesicles (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Hetero-oligomeric complex of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2
    and caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell membrane; caveola; peripheral membrane
    protein (By similarity). Note=Membrane-associated protein of
    caveolae (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the band 7/mec-2 family. Flotillin
    subfamily.
Membrane.
