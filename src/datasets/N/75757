cytadherence-accessory proteins HMW1 and HMW3.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the cytoskeleton-like structure which
    stabilizes the shape of the wall-less Mycoplasma. This
    cytoskeleton-like network of accessory proteins containing HMW
    proteins 1 to 5 allows the proper anchoring of cytadhesin proteins
    in the mycoplasmal membrane at the attachment organelle (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Attachment organelle; attachment organelle
    membrane. Note=Localizes specifically to the attachment membrane.
