-!- FUNCTION: Necessary for the complete degradation of mRNAs, both in
    normal mRNA turnover and in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Removes
    the 7-methyl guanine cap structure from mRNA fragments shorter
    than 10 nucleotides that are produced by 3'->5' exosome-mediated
    mRNA decay. Releases m7GMP. Can also degrade m7GDP to m7GMP. Has
    no activity towards mRNA molecules longer than 25 nucleotides.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Associates with components of the exosome
    multienzyme ribonuclease complex, such as EXOSC3 and EXOSC4.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Detected in liver, brain, kidney, testis and
    prostate.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HIT family.
