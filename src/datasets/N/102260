Modulator of apoptosis 1 (MAP-1) (MAP1) (Paraneoplastic antigen MA4).
"MAP-1, a novel proapoptotic protein containing a BH3-like motif that
associates with Bax through its Bcl-2 homology domains.";
"Complete sequencing and characterization of 21,243 full-length human
cDNAs.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
"The tumor suppressor RASSF1A and MAP-1 link death receptor signaling
to Bax conformational change and cell death.";
-!- FUNCTION: Required for death receptor-dependent apoptosis. When
    associated with RASSF1, promotes BAX conformational change and
    translocation to mitochondrial membranes in response to TNF and
    TNFSF10 stimulation.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer. Under normal circumstances, held in an
    inactive conformation by an intramolecular interaction. Binding to
    RASSF1 isoform A (RASSF1A) relieves this inhibitory interaction
    and allows further binding to BAX. Binds also to BCL2 and BCLX.
    Recruited to the TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF10A complexes in response to
    their respective cognate ligand, after internalization.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitously expressed with higher levels in
    heart and brain.
-!- DOMAIN: The BH3-like domain is required for association with BAX
    and for mediating apoptosis. The three BH domains (BH1, BH2, and
    BH3) of BAX are all required for mediating protein-protein
    interaction.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PNMA family.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 102.
