AC   Q92D33;
Peptide chain release factor 3 (RF-3).
"Comparative genomics of Listeria species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Increases the formation of ribosomal termination
    complexes and stimulates activities of RF-1 and RF-2. It binds
    guanine nucleotides and has strong preference for UGA stop codons.
    It may interact directly with the ribosome. The stimulation of RF-
    1 and RF-2 is significantly reduced by GTP and GDP, but not by GMP
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the GTP-binding elongation factor family.
    PrfC subfamily.
 GO:0006449; P:regulation of translational termination; IEA:HAMAP.
