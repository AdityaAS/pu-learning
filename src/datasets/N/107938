Myc proto-oncogene protein (c-Myc) (Transcription factor p64).
"Isolation and characterization of the porcine c-myc proto-oncogene
and chromosomal assignment to SSC 4p13.";
-!- FUNCTION: Participates in the regulation of gene transcription.
    Binds DNA both in a non-specific manner and also specifically to
    recognizes the core sequence 5'-CAC[GA]TG-3'. Seems to activate
    the transcription of growth-related genes (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Efficient DNA binding requires dimerization with another
    bHLH protein. Binds DNA as a heterodimer with MAX. Interacts with
    TAF1C and SPAG9. Interacts with PARP10 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated by PRKDC (By similarity).
-!- DISEASE: Overexpression of C-Myc is implicated in the etiology of
    a variety of hematopoietic tumors.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain.
