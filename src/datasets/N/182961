AC   P47191;
Synaptotagmin-1 (Synaptotagmin I) (SytI) (p65).
"Coordinate and noncoordinate regulation of synaptic vesicle protein
genes during embryonic development.";
-!- FUNCTION: May have a regulatory role in the membrane interactions
    during trafficking of synaptic vesicles at the active zone of the
    synapse. It binds acidic phospholipids with a specificity that
    requires the presence of both an acidic head group and a diacyl
    backbone.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 3 calcium ions per subunit. The ions are bound to
    the C2 domains (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (Probable).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasmic vesicle; secretory vesicle;
    synaptic vesicle. Cytoplasmic vesicle; secretory vesicle;
    chromaffin granule. Note=Synaptic vesicles and chromaffin
    granules.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the synaptotagmin family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 C2 domains.
