flexneri serotype 2a strain 2457T.";
-!- FUNCTION: This enzyme acts exclusively on hypoxanthine; it does
    not act on guanine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: IMP + diphosphate = hypoxanthine + 5-phospho-
    alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per subunit. One of the ions does
    not make direct protein contacts (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Purine salvage.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the purine/pyrimidine
    phosphoribosyltransferase family.
