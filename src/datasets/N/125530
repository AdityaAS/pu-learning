"Characterization of a tobacco gene encoding a pollen-specific
polygalacturonase.";
-!- FUNCTION: May function in depolymerizing pectin during pollen
    development, germination, and tube growth.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Random hydrolysis of 1,4-alpha-D-
    galactosiduronic linkages in pectate and other galacturonans.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Pollen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 28 family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 5 PbH1 repeats.
