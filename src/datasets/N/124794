AC   P87200; Q6CAQ1;
Peroxisomal membrane protein PEX17 (Peroxin-17).
"The peroxin Pex17p of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is associated
peripherally with the peroxisomal membrane and is required for the
import of a subset of matrix proteins.";
"Genome evolution in yeasts.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in peroxisome biosynthesis. Required for the
    import of a subset of matrix proteins into peroxisomes.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Peroxisome; peroxisomal membrane; multi-pass
    membrane protein. Note=Probably associated with the matrix face of
    the membrane.
