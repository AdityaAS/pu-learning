Ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.1) (Protoheme ferro-lyase) (Heme
synthetase).
"The complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium bovis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the ferrous insertion into protoporphyrin IX.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protoporphyrin + Fe(2+) = protoheme + 2 H(+).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; protoheme biosynthesis; protoheme
    from protoporphyrin-IX: single step [final step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ferrochelatase family.
