-!- FUNCTION: Acts as an E3 ligase mediating SUMO/Smt3 attachment to
    septins and PCNA. May be involved in chromosome maintenance.
-!- PATHWAY: SUMO conjugation; third step.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with UBC9 and CDC3.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm; cytosol. Nucleus. Bud; bud neck.
    Note=Present at the bud neck in early M-phase.
-!- DOMAIN: The SAP domain is required for nuclear targeting.
-!- DOMAIN: The SP-RING-type zinc finger mediates interaction with
    UBC9 and CDC3 and is required for E3 activity.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated in early M-phase.
-!- PTM: Autosumoylated upon ethanol stress.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Present with 149 molecules/cell.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PIAS family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SAP domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SP-RING-type zinc finger.
