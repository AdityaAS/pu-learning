Serine/threonine-protein kinase 35 (EC 2.7.11.1) (CLP-36-interacting
kinase) (Clik1) (PDLIM1-interacting kinase 1).
"Clik1: a novel kinase targeted to actin stress fibers by the CLP-36
PDZ-LIM protein.";

"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with PDLIM1/CLP-36.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Cytoplasm. Note=When associated
    with PDLIM1, it is mostly found in cytoplasm, localized to actin
    stress fibers.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in testis.
-!- PTM: Autophosphorylated.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.2 (CAI15591) sequence differs from that shown due to
    erroneous gene model prediction.
