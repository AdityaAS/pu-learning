AC   Q5BBV4;
Chromatin modification-related protein eaf3.
"Sequencing of Aspergillus nidulans and comparative analysis with A.
fumigatus and A. oryzae.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in deacetylation of histones, chromatin
    assembly and chromosome segregation. May act as a transcriptional
    oscillator, directing histone deacetylases to specific chromosomal
    domains. Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex
    which is involved in transcriptional activation of selected genes
    principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 and H2A. The
    NuA4 complex is also involved in DNA repair (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the MRG family.
