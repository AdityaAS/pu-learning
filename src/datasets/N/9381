AC   Q8Z1Z3;
Acetylornithine/succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.11)
(EC 2.6.1.17) (ACOAT) (Succinyldiaminopimelate transferase)
(DapATase).
"Complete genome sequence of a multiple drug resistant Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi CT18.";
"Comparative genomics of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi strains Ty2
and CT18.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in both the arginine and lysine biosynthetic
    pathways (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-N-acetyl-L-ornithine + 2-oxoglutarate = N-
    acetyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde + L-glutamate.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: N-succinyl-L-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate + 2-
    oxoglutarate = N-succinyl-2-L-amino-6-oxoheptanedioate + L-
    glutamate.
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-arginine biosynthesis; 2-N-
    acetyl-L-ornithine from L-glutamate: step 4.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-lysine biosynthesis via DAP
    pathway; LL-diaminopimelate from tetrahydrodipicolinate
    (succinylase route): step 2.
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid biosynthesis; L-lysine biosynthesis via DAP
    pathway; LL-diaminopimelate from tetrahydrodipicolinate
    (succinylase route): step 2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (Probable).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The reaction catalyzed by ACOAT is highly
    reversible. This enzyme may also transaminate ornithine (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-III pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
    aminotransferase family.
