AC   Q08640;
Hypothetical protein in bglA 3'region (ORF2) (Fragment).
"Comparative amino acid sequence analysis of Thermotoga maritima beta-
glucosidase (BglA) deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the gene
indicates distant relationship between beta-glucosidases of the BGA
family and other families of beta-1,4-glycosyl hydrolases.";
-!- CAUTION: As the DNA coding for this protein is not found in the
    complete genome of T.maritima. It could have originated from
    another bacterial species.
Hypothetical protein.
