AC   O30477; O50478;
Replicative DNA helicase (EC 3.6.1.-) [Contains: Endonuclease PI-
Rma43812IP (EC 3.1.-.-) (Rma dnaB intein)].
"A DnaB intein in Rhodothermus marinus: indication of recent intein
homing across remotely related organisms.";
"Cloning of a dnaB homolog gene from Rhodothermus marinus with high
similarity to the E.coli helicase but not able to complement a dnaBts
mutation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Participates in initiation and elongation during
    chromosome replication; it exhibits DNA-dependent ATPase activity
    (By similarity).
-!- PTM: This protein undergoes a protein self splicing that involves
    a post-translational excision of the intervening region (intein)
    followed by peptide ligation (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the helicase family. DnaB subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DOD-type homing endonuclease domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 SF4 helicase domain.
