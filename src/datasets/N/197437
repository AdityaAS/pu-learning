AC   O59819;
Probable UTP--glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.9)
(UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) (UDPGP) (UGPase).
"The genome sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a central role as a glucosyl donor in cellular
    metabolic pathways (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: UTP + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate =
    diphosphate + UDP-glucose.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the UDPGP type 1 family.
