AC   Q85CV5;
Chloroplast 50S ribosomal protein L20.
"The complete nucleotide sequence of the hornwort (Anthoceros
formosae) chloroplast genome: insight into the earliest land plants.";
"RNA editing in hornwort chloroplasts makes more than half the genes
functional.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds directly to 23S ribosomal RNA and is necessary for
    the in vitro assembly process of the 50S ribosomal subunit. It is
    not involved in the protein synthesizing functions of that subunit
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast.
-!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=29, 97; Note=The nonsense codon at
    position 97 is modified to a sense codon.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein L20P family.
