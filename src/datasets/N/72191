AC   Q5NI31;
Porphobilinogen deaminase (EC 2.5.1.61) (PBG) (Hydroxymethylbilane
synthase) (HMBS) (Pre-uroporphyrinogen synthase).
"The complete genome sequence of Francisella tularensis, the causative
agent of tularemia.";
-!- FUNCTION: Tetrapolymerization of the monopyrrole PBG into the
    hydroxymethylbilane pre-uroporphyrinogen in several discrete
    steps.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 4 porphobilinogen + H(2)O =
    hydroxymethylbilane + 4 NH(3).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 dipyrromethane group covalently (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; porphyrin biosynthesis;
    coproporphyrinogen III from 5-aminolevulinate: step 2.
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The porphobilinogen subunits are added to the
    dipyrromethan group.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the HMBS family.
