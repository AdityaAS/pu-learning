"Genome sequence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.";
"Complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and genomic comparison with a laboratory strain K-12.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-glucose 6-phosphate + NADP(+) = D-glucono-
    1,5-lactone 6-phosphate + NADPH.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; pentose phosphate pathway; D-
    ribulose 5-phosphate from D-glucose 6-phosphate (oxidative stage):
    step 1.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
    family.
