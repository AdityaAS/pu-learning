AC   Q9STX0;
Probable WRKY transcription factor 7 (WRKY DNA-binding protein 7).
"Evidence for an important role of WRKY DNA binding proteins in the
regulation of NPR1 gene expression.";
"Sequence and analysis of chromosome 4 of the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
"Empirical analysis of transcriptional activity in the Arabidopsis
genome.";
"Full-length cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana.";
"A new member of the Arabidopsis WRKY transcription factor family,
AtWRKY6, is associated with both senescence- and defence-related
processes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transcription factor. Interacts specifically with the W
    box (5'-(T)TGAC(C/T)-3'), a frequently occurring elicitor-
    responsive cis-acting element (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (Probable).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: In young, mature and senescent leaves.
-!- INDUCTION: By salicylic acid and strongly during leaf senescence.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the WRKY group II-d family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 WRKY DNA-binding domain.
