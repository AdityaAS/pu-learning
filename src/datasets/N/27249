ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit 1 (EC 3.4.21.92)
(Endopeptidase Clp 1).
"Inactivation of the clpP1 gene for the proteolytic subunit of the
ATP-dependent Clp protease in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus limits
growth and light acclimation.";
"Complete sequence of chromosome 1 of Synechococcus elongatus PCC
7942.";
-!- FUNCTION: Cleaves peptides in various proteins in a process that
    requires ATP hydrolysis. Has a chymotrypsin-like activity. Plays a
    major role in the degradation of misfolded proteins (By
    similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Hydrolysis of proteins to small peptides in
    the presence of ATP and magnesium. Alpha-casein is the usual test
    substrate. In the absence of ATP, only oligopeptides shorter than
    five residues are hydrolyzed (such as succinyl-Leu-Tyr-|-NHMec;
    and Leu-Tyr-Leu-|-Tyr-Trp, in which cleavage of the -Tyr-|-Leu-
    and -Tyr-|-Trp bonds also occurs).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase S14 family.
