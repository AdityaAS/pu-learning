Dephospho-CoA kinase (EC 2.7.1.24) (Dephosphocoenzyme A kinase).
"Completion of the genome sequence of Brucella abortus and comparison
to the highly similar genomes of Brucella melitensis and Brucella
suis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the phosphorylation of the 3'-hydroxyl group
    of dephosphocoenzyme A to form coenzyme A (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + dephospho-CoA = ADP + CoA.
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; coenzyme A biosynthesis; coenzyme
    A from pantothenate: step 5 [final step].
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the coaE family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 DPCK (dephospho-CoA kinase) domain.
