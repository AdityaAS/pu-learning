Golgin subfamily A member 8A/B (Golgi autoantigen golgin-67) (88 kDa
Golgi protein) (Gm88 autoantigen).
"Human autoantibodies to a novel Golgi protein golgin-67: high
similarity with golgin-95/gm 130 autoantigen.";
"Identification and characterization of a novel Golgi protein, golgin-
67.";
"GM88, a 88-kDa Golgi protein homologous to GM130.";
"Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes. XII.
The complete sequences of 100 new cDNA clones from brain which code
for large proteins in vitro.";
-!- FUNCTION: May be involved in maintaining Golgi structure (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack; Golgi stack
    membrane; peripheral membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in brain, heart and kidney.
    Detected at lower levels in liver, thymus, spleen, lung and
    peripheral blood leukocytes.
-!- DOMAIN: Extended rod-like protein with coiled-coil domains.
-!- DISEASE: Antibodies against GM88 are present in serum from a
    patient with Sjoegren syndrome. Sera from patients with Sjoegren
    syndrome often contain antibodies that react with normal
    components of the Golgi complex.
-!- CAUTION: Maps to a duplicated region on chromosome 15; the gene is
    present in 2 almost identical copies.
Coiled coil; Golgi apparatus.
