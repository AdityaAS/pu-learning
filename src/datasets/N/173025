proteoglycan core protein, bamacan: a five domain structure including
coiled-coil motifs.";
"Association of mammalian SMC1 and SMC3 proteins with meiotic
chromosomes and synaptonemal complexes.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in chromosome cohesion during cell cycle and in
    DNA repair. Central component of cohesin complex. The cohesin
    complex is required for the cohesion of sister chromatids after
    DNA replication. The cohesin complex apparently forms a large
    proteinaceous ring within which sister chromatids can be trapped.
    At anaphase, the complex is cleaved and dissociates from
    chromatin, allowing sister chromatids to segregate. The cohesin
    complex may also play a role in spindle pole assembly during
    mitosis (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Forms a heterodimer with SMC1A or SMC1B in cohesin
    complexes. Cohesin complexes are composed of the SMC1 (SMC1A or
    SMC1B) and SMC3 heterodimer attached via their hinge domain, RAD21
    which link them, and one STAG protein (STAG1, STAG2 or STAG3),
    which interacts with RAD21. Also found in meiosis-specific cohesin
    complexes. Interacts with NUMA1, and forms a ternary complex with
    KIF3B and KIFAP3, suggesting a function in tethering the
    chromosomes to the spindle pole and a function in chromosome
    movement. Interacts with MXI1, MXD3 and MXD4. Found in a complex
    with SMC1A, CDCA5 and RAD21, PDS5A/APRIN and PDS5B/SCC-112 (By
    similarity). Interacts with SYCP2.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity). Note=Associates
    with chromatin. Before prophase it is scattered along chromosome
    arms. During prophase, most of cohesin complexes dissociate from
    chromatin probably because of phosphorylation by PLK, except at
    centromeres, where cohesin complexes remain. At anaphase, the
    RAD21 subunit of the cohesin complex is cleaved, leading to the
    dissociation of the complex from chromosomes, allowing chromosome
    separation (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous.
-!- DOMAIN: The flexible hinge domain, which separates the large
    intramolecular coiled coil regions, allows the heterotypic
    interaction with the corresponding domain of SMC1A or SMC1B,
    forming a V-shaped heterodimer. The two heads of the heterodimer
    are then connected by different ends of the cleavable RAD21
    protein, forming a ring structure (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SMC family. SMC3 subfamily.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 originally reported this protein to be a
    proteoglycan (thus explaining its name). Although not excluded,
    such secreted function is not clear.
