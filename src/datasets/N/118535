a subset of R8 photoreceptor cells.";

-!- FUNCTION: Visual pigments are the light-absorbing molecules that
    mediate vision. They consist of an apoprotein, opsin, covalently
    linked to cis-retinal.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
    Name=B;
      IsoId=O01668-1; Sequence=Displayed;
    Name=A;
      IsoId=O01668-2; Sequence=VSP_009271;
      Note=No experimental confirmation available;
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Each Drosophila eye is composed of 800 facets
    or ommatidia. Each ommatidium contains 8 photoreceptor cells (R1-
    R8), the R1 to R6 cells are outer cells, while R7 and R8 are inner
    cells. Rh6 is expressed in a subset of R8 cells, most likely
    expressed in the subset of R8 cells paired with Rh4-expressing R7
    cells (R7y).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on some or all of the serine and threonine
    residues present in the C-terminal region (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
    Opsin subfamily.
