-!- FUNCTION: PA2 catalyzes the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of the 2-
    acyl groups in 3-sn-phosphoglycerides.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Phosphatidylcholine + H(2)O = 1-
    acylglycerophosphocholine + a carboxylate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phospholipase A2 family.
