Peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase msrA (EC 1.8.4.11) (Protein-
methionine-S-oxide reductase) (Peptide-methionine (S)-S-oxide
reductase) (Peptide Met(O) reductase).
"Complete genome sequence of the alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus
halodurans and genomic sequence comparison with Bacillus subtilis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Has an important function as a repair enzyme for
    proteins that have been inactivated by oxidation. Catalyzes the
    reversible oxidation-reduction of methionine sulfoxide in proteins
    to methionine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Peptide-L-methionine + thioredoxin disulfide +
    H(2)O = peptide-L-methionine (S)-S-oxide + thioredoxin.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-methionine + thioredoxin disulfide + H(2)O =
    L-methionine (S)-S-oxide + thioredoxin.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the msrA Met sulfoxide reductase family.
