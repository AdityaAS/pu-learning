AC   Q8FH03;
Succinylglutamate desuccinylase (EC 3.5.1.96).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Transforms 2-N-succinylglutamate into succinate and
    glutamate (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: N-succinyl-L-glutamate + H(2)O = succinate +
    L-glutamate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit (Potential).
-!- PATHWAY: Amino-acid degradation; L-arginine degradation via AST
    pathway; L-glutamate and succinate from L-arginine: step 5 [final
    step].
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the aspA/astE family. Succinylglutamate
    desuccinylase subfamily.
