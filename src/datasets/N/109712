Nucleocapsid protein (N structural protein) (NC).
"Reverse genetics system for the avian coronavirus infectious
bronchitis virus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Major structural component of virions that associates
    with genomic RNA to form a long, flexible, helical nucleocapsid.
    Interaction with the M protein leads to the formation of virus
    particles. Binds to cellular membranes and phospholipids. Elicits
    cell-mediated immunity. May play roles in viral transcription and
    translation, and/or replication (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Monomer and oligomer. Both monomeric and oligomeric forms
    interact with RNA. Interacts with the M protein (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Virion (By similarity). Cell membrane (By
    similarity). Note=Located inside the virion, complexed with the
    viral RNA. May be associated with cellular membranes where it
    participates in viral RNA synthesis and virus budding (By
    similarity).
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated on serine residues (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the coronaviruses nucleocapsid protein
    family.
