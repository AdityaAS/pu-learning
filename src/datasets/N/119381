-!- FUNCTION: Essential subunit of N-oligosaccharyl transferase enzyme
    which catalyzes the transfer of a high mannose oligosaccharide to
    an asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in
    nascent polypeptide chains.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Dolichyl diphosphooligosaccharide + protein L-
    asparagine = dolichyl diphosphate + a glycoprotein with the
    oligosaccharide chain attached by N-glycosyl linkage to protein L-
    asparagine.
-!- PATHWAY: Glycosylation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum
    membrane; single-pass type I membrane protein (Potential).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DDOST 48 kDa subunit family.
