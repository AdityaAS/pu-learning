AC   Q8XT38;
Periplasmic trehalase precursor (EC 3.2.1.28) (Alpha,alpha-trehalase)
(Alpha,alpha-trehalose glucohydrolase).
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Provides the cells with the ability to utilize trehalose
    at high osmolarity by splitting it into glucose molecules that can
    subsequently be taken up by the phosphotransferase-mediated uptake
    system (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Alpha,alpha-trehalose + H(2)O = 2 D-glucose.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 37 family.
