AC   Q99MP3;
Calcitonin gene-related peptide 2 precursor (Calcitonin gene-related
peptide II) (CGRP-II) (Beta-type CGRP).
"Structure of the mouse calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide
alpha and beta genes.";
-!- FUNCTION: CGRP induces vasodilation. It dilates a variety of
    vessels including the coronary, cerebral and systemic vasculature.
    Its abundance in the CNS also points toward a neurotransmitter or
    neuromodulator role (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the calcitonin family.
Amidation; Cleavage on pair of basic residues; Hormone; Signal.
