AC   P52770;
Cytochrome b6-f complex subunit 4 (17 kDa polypeptide).
"Loss of all ndh genes as determined by sequencing the entire
chloroplast genome of the black pine Pinus thunbergii.";
-!- FUNCTION: Component of the cytochrome b6-f complex, which mediates
    electron transfer between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I
    (PSI), cyclic electron flow around PSI, and state transitions (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: The 4 large subunits of the cytochrome b6-f complex are
    cytochrome b6, subunit IV (17 kDa polypeptide, petD), cytochrome f
    and the Rieske protein, while the 4 small subunits are petG, petL,
    petM and petN. The complex functions as a dimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; multi-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the cytochrome b family. PetD subfamily.
