AC   P33676;
Enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) (2-phosphoglycerate dehydratase) (2-phospho-D-
glycerate hydro-lyase).
"Cloning and functional expression of a Schistosoma japonicum cDNA
homologous to the enolase gene family.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-phospho-D-glycerate = phosphoenolpyruvate +
    H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium. Required for catalysis and for stabilizing
    the dimer (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; pyruvate from D-
    glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate: step 4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the enolase family.
Glycolysis; Lyase; Magnesium; Metal-binding.
