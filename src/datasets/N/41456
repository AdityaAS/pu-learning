AC   P12293;
Methanol dehydrogenase subunit 1 precursor (EC 1.1.99.8) (MDH large
alpha subunit) (MEDH).
"Isolation and nucleotide sequence of the methanol dehydrogenase
structural gene from Paracoccus denitrificans.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: A primary alcohol + acceptor = an aldehyde +
    reduced acceptor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 PQQ group per subunit. PQQ is inserted between
    disulfide Cys-135-Cys-136 and the indole ring of Trp-275 (By
    similarity).
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion per subunit (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterotetramer composed of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Periplasm.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: MDH is the major protein in the cell during growth
    on methanol (in P.denitrificans MDH constitutes up to 15% of the
    total cell protein).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bacterial PQQ dehydrogenase family.
