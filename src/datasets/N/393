-!- FUNCTION: The B regulatory subunit might modulate substrate
    selectivity and catalytic activity, and also might direct the
    localization of the catalytic enzyme to a particular subcellular
    compartment (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: PP2A consists of a common heterodimeric core enzyme,
    composed of a 36 kDa catalytic subunit (subunit C) and a 65 kDa
    constant regulatory subunit (PR65 or subunit A), that associates
    with a variety of regulatory subunits. Proteins that associate
    with the core dimer include three families of regulatory subunits
    B (the R2/B/PR55/B55, R3/B''/PR72/PR130/PR59 and R5/B'/B56
    families), the 48 kDa variable regulatory subunit, viral proteins,
    and cell signaling molecules (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B
    family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 7 WD repeats.
Repeat; WD repeat.
