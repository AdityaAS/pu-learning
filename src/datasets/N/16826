Transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3 precursor (Beta
ig-h3) (Kerato-epithelin) (RGD-containing collagen-associated protein)
(RGD-CAP).
"Characterization of a cartilage-derived 66-kDa protein (RGD-CAP/beta
ig-h3) that binds to collagen.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to type I, II, and IV collagens. This adhesion
    protein may play an important role in cell-collagen interactions.
    In cartilage, may be involved in endochondral bone formation.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein; extracellular space.
    Note=May be associated both with microfibrils and with the cell
    surface.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely distributed in various tissues except
    for the brain. High levels in corneal epithelium.
-!- DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Expressed in chondrocytes during all stages.
    Highest levels during the prehypertrophic stage.
-!- INDUCTION: By TGF-beta.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 EMI domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 4 FAS1 domains.
