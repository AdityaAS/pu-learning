Transforming protein erbA (Oncogene erbA).
"Sequencing the erbA gene of avian erythroblastosis virus reveals a
new type of oncogene.";
"A single point mutation in erbA restores the erythroid transforming
potential of a mutant avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) defective in
both erbA and erbB oncogenes.";
"Protein encoded by v-erbA functions as a thyroid-hormone receptor
antagonist.";
-!- FUNCTION: Acts as a thyroid-hormone receptor antagonist. The v-
    ErbA oncogene cooperates with v-ErbB and other primarily sarcoma-
    inducing oncogenes in transformation of erythroblasts. It is non
    transforming by itself and cannot induce self-renewal of
    erythroblasts. Instead it blocks the residual capacity of the v-
    ErbB cells to differentiate terminally.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: THRA, the cellular counterpart of v-ErbA, is a
    thyroid hormone receptor alpha.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This protein is synthesized as a Gag-ErbA-ErbB
    polyprotein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor family. NR1
    subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 nuclear receptor DNA-binding domain.
-!- CAUTION: Ref.1 sequence differs from that shown due to a
    frameshift in position 381.
