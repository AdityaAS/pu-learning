Hyaluronan mediated motility receptor (Intracellular hyaluronic acid-
binding protein) (Receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility) (CD168
antigen).
"The human hyaluronan receptor RHAMM is expressed as an intracellular
protein in breast cancer cells.";
"The characterization of a human RHAMM cDNA: conservation of the
hyaluronan-binding domains.";
"Phosphoproteome analysis of the human mitotic spindle.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in cell motility. When hyaluronan binds to
    HMMR, the phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including the
    focal adhesion kinase occurs. May also be involved in cellular
    transformation and metastasis formation, and in regulating
    extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activity.
-!- SUBUNIT: Subunit of the HARC complex.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cell surface. Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=2;
