10 kDa chaperonin (Protein Cpn10) (groES protein) (Heat shock protein
10).
"Molecular characterization of the gene operon of heat shock proteins
HSP60 and HSP10 in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.";
-!- FUNCTION: Binds to Cpn60 in the presence of Mg-ATP and suppresses
    the ATPase activity of the latter.
-!- SUBUNIT: Heptamer of 7 subunits arranged in a ring (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- INDUCTION: By heat shock.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the groES chaperonin family.
