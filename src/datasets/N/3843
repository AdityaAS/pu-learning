AC   Q01341;
Adenylate cyclase type 6 (EC 4.6.1.1) (Adenylate cyclase type VI) (ATP
pyrophosphate-lyase 6) (Adenylyl cyclase 6) (Ca(2+)-inhibitable
adenylyl cyclase).
"Cloning and expression of a Ca(2+)-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase from
NCB-20 cells.";
"Lowered responsiveness of the catalyst of adenylyl cyclase to
stimulation by GS in heterologous desensitization: a role for
adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent phosphorylation.";
-!- FUNCTION: Membrane-bound, calcium-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP = 3',5'-cyclic AMP + diphosphate.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 2 magnesium ions per subunit (By similarity).
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibition by calcium in the submicromolar
    concentration range.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Most abundant in heart but weakly detectable
    in brain, intestine, lung and spleen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the adenylyl cyclase class-4/guanylyl
    cyclase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 guanylate cyclase domains.
