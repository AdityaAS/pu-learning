Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate polymerase (EC 2.3.1.-) (Poly(3-
hydroxybutyrate) polymerase) (PHB polymerase) (PHB synthase) (Poly(3-
hydroxyalkanoate) polymerase) (PHA polymerase) (PHA synthase)
(Polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthase).
"Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate turnover in Azorhizobium caulinodans is
required for growth and affects nifA expression.";
-!- FUNCTION: Polymerizes d(-)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA to create PHB
    which consists of thousands of hydroxybutyrate molecules linked
    end to end. PHB serves as an intracellular energy reserve material
    when cells grow under conditions of nutrient limitation.
-!- PATHWAY: Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate biosynthesis; third step.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the PHA/PHB synthase family.
Acyltransferase; PHB biosynthesis; Transferase.
