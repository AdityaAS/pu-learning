AC   P18573;
Alpha/beta-gliadin MM1 precursor (Prolamin).
"Nucleotide sequence of a cDNA encoding an alpha/beta-type gliadin
from hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum).";
"Structural basis for gluten intolerance in celiac sprue.";
-!- FUNCTION: Gliadin is the major seed storage protein in wheat.
-!- PTM: Substrate of transglutaminase.
-!- ALLERGEN: Causes an allergic reaction in human. Is the cause of
    the celiac disease, also known as celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive
    enteropathy.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: An internal 33-mer peptide seems to be the primary
    initiator of the inflammatory response to gluten.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: The alpha/beta-gliadins can be divided into 5
    homology classes. Sequence divergence between the classes is due
    to single base substitutions and to duplications or deletions
    within or near direct repeats. There are more than a 100 copies of
    the gene for alpha/beta-gliadin per haploid genome.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gliadin/glutenin family.
