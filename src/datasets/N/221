AC   Q89XR6;
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (EC 3.5.99.7) (ACC
deaminase) (ACCD).
"Complete genomic sequence of nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacterium
Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes a cyclopropane ring-opening reaction, the
    irreversible conversion of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)
    to ammonia and alpha-ketobutyrate. Allows growth on ACC as a
    nitrogen source (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate + H(2)O = 2-
    oxobutanoate + NH(3).
-!- COFACTOR: Pyridoxal phosphate (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotrimer (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ACC deaminase/D-cysteine desulfhydrase
    family.
 GO:0018871; P:1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate metabolism; IEA:HAMAP.
