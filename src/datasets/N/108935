AC   Q8Y8E7;
Glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (EC 3.5.99.6) (Glucosamine-6-
phosphate isomerase) (GNPDA) (GlcN6P deaminase).
"Comparative genomics of Listeria species.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the reversible isomerization-deamination of
    glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN6P) to form fructose 6-phosphate
    (Fru6P) and ammonium ion (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: D-glucosamine 6-phosphate + H(2)O = D-fructose
    6-phosphate + NH(3).
-!- PATHWAY: N-acetylglucosamine utilization.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the glucosamine/galactosamine-6-phosphate
    isomerase family. NagB subfamily.
Carbohydrate metabolism; Complete proteome; Hydrolase.
