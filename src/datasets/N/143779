to replication and its regulation.";
"Correction. A revision of the nucleotide sequence and functional map
of pUB110.";
-!- FUNCTION: Produces a single-strand nick in a specific site of the
    plasmid, and this nick results in single-strand replication by
    rolling circle mechanism.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the Gram-positive plasmids replication
    protein type 1 family.
DNA replication; Plasmid.
