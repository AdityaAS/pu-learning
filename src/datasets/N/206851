WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1
(Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif).
"TAZ: a novel transcriptional co-activator regulated by interactions
with 14-3-3 and PDZ domain proteins.";
"The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA
project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC).";
-!- FUNCTION: Functions as a transcriptional coactivator.
-!- SUBUNIT: Binds to SLC9A3R2 via the PDZ motif at the plasma
    membrane. Binds to YWHAZ in vivo and in vitro through the
    phosphoserine-binding motif RSHSSP.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Nucleus. Cytoplasm. Note=Concentrates along
    specific portions of the plasma membrane, and accumulates in
    punctate nuclear bodies. When phosphorylated is retained in
    cytoplasm by YWHAZ.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in kidney, heart, placenta
    and lung.
-!- DOMAIN: The PDZ-binding motif is essential for stimulated gene
    transcription. It localizes the protein into both punctate nuclear
    foci and plasma membrane-associated complexes.
-!- DOMAIN: Binds to transcription factors via its WW domain.
-!- PTM: Phosphorylated. Phosphorylation results in the inhibition of
    transcriptional coactivation through YWHAZ-mediated nuclear
    export.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 WW domain.
