AC   Q8Y1G2;
Transcriptional repressor nrdR.
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum.";
-!- FUNCTION: Negatively regulates transcription of bacterial
    ribonucleotide reductase nrd genes and operons. Repression of nrd
    genes and operons seems to be direct and acts by binding specific
    sequences (NrdR-boxes) in the promoter region (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the nrdR family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ATP-cone domain.
