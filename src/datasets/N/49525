AC   Q8ZYE7;
Enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) (2-phosphoglycerate dehydratase) (2-phospho-D-
glycerate hydro-lyase).
"Genome sequence of the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum
aerophilum.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2-phospho-D-glycerate = phosphoenolpyruvate +
    H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Magnesium. Required for catalysis and for stabilizing
    the dimer (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate degradation; glycolysis; pyruvate from D-
    glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate: step 4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the enolase family.
 GO:0000287; F:magnesium ion binding; IEA:HAMAP.
