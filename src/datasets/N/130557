AC   P0A5A7; O53230;
Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.4) (PPO).
"Deciphering the biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the
complete genome sequence.";
"Re-annotation of the genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
H37Rv.";
"Whole-genome comparison of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical and
laboratory strains.";
-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the 6-electron oxidation of protoporphyrinogen
    IX to form protoporphyrin IX.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Protoporphyrinogen-IX + 1.5 O(2) =
    protoporphyrin-IX + 3 H(2)O.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 FAD per dimer (By similarity).
-!- PATHWAY: Cofactor biosynthesis; porphyrin biosynthesis;
    protoporphyrin-IX from protoporphyrinogen-IX: single step [final
    step].
-!- SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the protoporphyrinogen oxidase family.
