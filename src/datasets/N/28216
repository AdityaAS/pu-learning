"N-glucosylation of cytokinins by glycosyltransferases of Arabidopsis
thaliana.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the N-glucosylation of cytokinins. Catalyzes
    the formation of both the 7-N and the 9-N-glucosides.
-!- ENZYME REGULATION: Inhibited by olomoucine and 3-isobutyl-1-
    methylxanthine.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=0.22 mM for trans-zeatin (at 30 degrees Celsius and pH 7.0);
      KM=0.22 mM for dihydrozeatin (at 30 degrees Celsius and pH 7.0);
      KM=0.07 mM for N6-isopentenyladenine (at 30 degrees Celsius and
      pH 7.0);
      KM=0.04 mM for N6-benzyladenine (at 30 degrees Celsius and pH
      7.0);
