AC   Q8PFG7;
Thymidylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.9) (dTMP kinase).
"Comparison of the genomes of two Xanthomonas pathogens with differing
host specificities.";
-!- FUNCTION: Phosphorylation of dTMP to form dTDP in both de novo and
    salvage pathways of dTTP synthesis (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + dTMP = ADP + dTDP.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the thymidylate kinase family.
ATP-binding; Complete proteome; Kinase; Nucleotide biosynthesis;
Nucleotide-binding; Transferase.
