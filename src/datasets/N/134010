AC   P60130; P29301;
Photosystem II reaction center protein L (PSII-L) (PSII 5 kDa
protein).
"RNA editing in tobacco chloroplasts leads to the formation of a
translatable psbL mRNA by a C to U substitution within the initiation
codon.";
-!- FUNCTION: Not known, it is however required for PSII activity (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Plastid; chloroplast; chloroplast thylakoid
    membrane; single-pass membrane protein (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the psbL family.
