AC   P33745;
Pro-MCH 1 precursor [Contains: Neuropeptide-glutamic acid-valine (NEV)
(Neuropeptide E-V); Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)].
"Cloning and expression of melanin-concentrating hormone genes in the
rainbow trout brain.";
-!- FUNCTION: Plays a role in skin pigmentation by antagonizing the
    action of melanotropin alpha. Induces melanin concentration within
    the melanophores. May participate in the control of the
    hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal gland axis by inhibiting the release
    of ACTH.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Pituitary gland. Produced in neurons of
    lateral basal hypothalamus which project both to the brain and to
    the neural lobe of the pituitary gland from where MCH is released.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the melanin-concentrating hormone family.
