AC   Q8MJC3;
Caspase-3 precursor (EC 3.4.22.-) (CASP-3) (Apopain) (Cysteine
protease CPP32) [Contains: Caspase-3 p17 subunit; Caspase-3 p12
subunit].
"Molecular characterization of rabbit CPP32 and its function in
vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in the activation cascade of caspases
    responsible for apoptosis execution. At the onset of apoptosis it
    proteolytically cleaves poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) at a
    '216-Asp-|-Gly-217' bond. Cleaves and activates sterol regulatory
    element binding proteins (SREBPs) between the basic helix-loop-
    helix leucine zipper domain and the membrane attachment domain.
    Cleaves and activates caspase-6, -7 and -9 (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Heterodimer of a 17 kDa (p17) and a 12 kDa (p12) subunit
    (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm.
-!- PTM: Cleavage by granzyme B, caspase-6, caspase-8 and caspase-10
    generates the two active subunits. Additional processing of the
    propeptides is likely due to the autocatalytic activity of the
    activated protease. Active heterodimers between the small subunit
    of caspase-7 protease and the large subunit of caspase-3 also
    occur and vice versa (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the peptidase C14 family.
