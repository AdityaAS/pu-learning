AC   Q6KHH5;
30S ribosomal protein S15.
"The complete genome and proteome of Mycoplasma mobile.";
-!- FUNCTION: One of the primary rRNA binding proteins, it binds
    directly to 16S rRNA where it helps nucleate assembly of the
    platform of the 30S subunit by binding and bridging several RNA
    helices of the 16S rRNA (By similarity).
-!- FUNCTION: Forms an intersubunit bridge (bridge B4) with the 23S
    rRNA of the 50S subunit in the ribosome (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Part of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Forms a bridge to the
    50S subunit in the 70S ribosome, contacting the 23S rRNA (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the ribosomal protein S15P family.
