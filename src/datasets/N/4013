AC   P30174;
Actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) (Fragment).
"Molecular cloning and characterization of anther-preferential cDNA
encoding a putative actin-depolymerizing factor.";
-!- FUNCTION: Actin-depolymerizing protein. Severs actin filaments (F-
    actin) and binds to actin monomers (By similarity).
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Preferentially in mature anther.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the actin-binding proteins ADF family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 ADF-H domain.
Actin-binding.
