-!- FUNCTION: Stimulates a migratory response in CD4+ lymphocytes,
    monocytes, and eosinophils. Also induces T-lymphocyte expression
    of interleukin 2 receptor. Ligand for CD4.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer. The precursor protein interacts with
    PPP1R12A.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Secreted protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 2 PDZ (DHR) domains.
