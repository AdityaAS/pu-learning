(Glutathione S-transferase subunit 13) (GST class-kappa) (GSTK1-1)
(rGSTK1).
"Glutathione S-transferase class Kappa: characterization by the
cloning of rat mitochondrial GST and identification of a human
homologue.";
"A novel glutathione transferase (13-13) isolated from the matrix of
rat liver mitochondria having structural similarity to class theta
enzymes.";
