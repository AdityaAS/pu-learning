-!- FUNCTION: Receptor on natural killer cells. May inhibit the
    activity of NK cells thus preventing cell lysis.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; single-pass type I membrane
    protein.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 3 Ig-like C2-type (immunoglobulin-like)
    domains.
