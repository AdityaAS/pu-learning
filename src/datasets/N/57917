AC   Q8UEY7;
Fumarate hydratase class II (EC 4.2.1.2) (Fumarase C).
"The genome of the natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens
C58.";
"Genome sequence of the plant pathogen and biotechnology agent
Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.";
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: (S)-malate = fumarate + H(2)O.
-!- PATHWAY: Carbohydrate metabolism; tricarboxylic acid cycle.
-!- SUBUNIT: Homotetramer (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: There are 2 substrate binding sites: the catalytic
    A site, and the non-catalytic B site that may play a role in the
    transfer of substrate or product between the active site and the
    solvent. Alternatively, the B site may bind allosteric effectors
    (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the class-II fumarase/aspartase family.
    Fumarase subfamily.
 GO:0006099; P:tricarboxylic acid cycle; IEA:HAMAP.
