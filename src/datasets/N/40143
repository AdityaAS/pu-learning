Cold-shock DEAD box protein A (EC 3.6.1.-) (ATP-dependent RNA helicase
deaD).
"Extensive mosaic structure revealed by the complete genome sequence
of uropathogenic Escherichia coli.";
-!- FUNCTION: Has a helix-destabilizing activity. Plays a key role in
    optimal cell growth at low temperature and is required for normal
    cell division. Suppressor of a mutant defective in rpsB gene for
    ribosomal protein S2 (By similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DEAD box helicase family.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase ATP-binding domain.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 helicase C-terminal domain.
