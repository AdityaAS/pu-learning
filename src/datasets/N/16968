AC   P06651;
Bindin precursor.
"Sequence of mRNA coding for bindin, a species-specific sea urchin
sperm protein required for fertilization.";
-!- FUNCTION: Species-specific sea urchin sperm protein required for
    adhesion of sperm to the egg surface during fertilization. Bindin
    coats the acrosomal process after it is externalized by the
    acrosome reaction. It binds to sulfated, fucose-containing
    polysaccharides on the vitelline layer receptor proteoglycans
    which cover the egg plasma membrane.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Acrosome; acrosomal lumen.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the bindin family.
Cell adhesion; Fertilization; Signal.
