AC   Q6GLS4;
CaM kinase-like vesicle-associated protein.
-!- FUNCTION: Does not appear to have detectable kinase activity.
-!- COFACTOR: Calcium (By similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Interacts with calmodulin, in the presence of calcium (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; peripheral membrane protein (By
    similarity). Note=May be associated with vesicular structures (By
    similarity).
-!- DOMAIN: The protein kinase domain is predicted to be catalytically
    inactive.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 1 protein kinase domain.
