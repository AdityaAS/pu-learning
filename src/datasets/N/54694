-!- FUNCTION: Fibronectins bind cell surfaces and various compounds
    including collagen, fibrin, heparin, DNA, and actin. Fibronectins
    are involved in cell adhesion, cell motility, opsonization, wound
    healing, and maintenance of cell shape. Interaction with TNR
    mediates inhibition of cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth (By
    similarity).
-!- SUBUNIT: Mostly heterodimers or multimers of alternatively spliced
    variants, connected by 2 disulfide bonds near the carboxyl ends;
    to a lesser extend homodimers. Interacts with FBLN1, AMBP, TNR and
    LGALS3BP.
