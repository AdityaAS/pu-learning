AC   P24427;
FeMo cofactor biosynthesis protein nifB.
"Molecular linkage of the nif/fix and nod gene regions in Rhizobium
leguminosarum biovar trifolii.";
"The nifA gene product from Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii
lacks the N-terminal domain found in other NifA proteins.";
-!- FUNCTION: Probably involved in the synthesis of the Fe-Mo
    cofactor.
-!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 4Fe-4S cluster. The cluster is coordinated with
    3 cysteines and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine (By
    similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the moaA/nifB/pqqE family.
4Fe-4S; Iron; Iron-sulfur; Metal-binding; Nitrogen fixation; Plasmid;
