AC   Q05357;
Putative polyketide beta-ketoacyl synthase 2 (EC 2.3.1.-) (KS)
(Polyketide condensing enzyme).
"Hybridization and DNA sequence analyses suggest an early evolutionary
divergence of related biosynthetic gene sets encoding polyketide
antibiotics and spore pigments in Streptomyces spp.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in developmentally regulated synthesis of a
    compound biosynthetically related to polyketide antibiotics which
    is essential for spore color in Streptomyces halstedii.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: This putative ketoacyl synthase lacks the active
    site cysteine.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases family.
Acyltransferase; Transferase.
