-!- FUNCTION: Catalyzes the formation of acetoacetyl-CoA in the
    biosynthesis of mevalonate, an intermediate required for the
    biosynthesis of sterols and nonsterol isoprenoids.
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: 2 acetyl-CoA = CoA + acetoacetyl-CoA.
-!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
    Kinetic parameters:
      KM=0.16 mM for CoA;
      KM=0.35 mM for acetoacetyl-CoA;
    pH dependence:
      Optimum pH is 8.8;
-!- PATHWAY: Metabolic intermediate biosynthesis; mevalonate
    biosynthesis; R-mevalonate from acetyl-CoA: step 1.
-!- PATHWAY: Context: Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate biosynthesis.
-!- SUBUNIT: Multimeric.
