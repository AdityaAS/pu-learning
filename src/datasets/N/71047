AC   P10061;
Hemoglobin subunit beta-2 (Hemoglobin beta-2 chain) (Beta-2-globin).
"Primary structure of the hemoglobins from Sphenodon (Sphenodon
punctatus, Tuatara, Rynchocephalia). Evidence for the expression of
alpha D-gene.";
-!- FUNCTION: Involved in oxygen transport from the lung to the
    various peripheral tissues.
-!- SUBUNIT: There are three forms of hemoglobin in Sphenodon: A, A'
    and D. Hb A is a tetramer of two alpha-A and two beta-1, Hb A' is
    a tetramer of two alpha-a and two beta-2, Hb D is a tetramer of
    two alpha-D and two beta-2.
-!- MISCELLANEOUS: Sphenodon Hbs have properties not found in other
    reptiles: poor cooperativity, high affinity for oxygen, small Bohr
    and haldane effects, appreciable phosphate effects (those
    properties are also found in the Hbs of primitive urodele and
    caecilian amphibians).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the globin family.
