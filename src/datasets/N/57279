-!- FUNCTION: Receptor for follicle-stimulating hormone. The activity
    of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate
    adenylate cyclase.
-!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Membrane; multi-pass membrane protein.
-!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Sertoli cells and ovarian granulosa cells.
-!- PTM: N-glycosylated; indirectly required for FSH-binding, possibly
    via a conformational change that allows high affinity binding of
    hormone.
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family.
    FSH/LSH/TSH subfamily.
-!- SIMILARITY: Contains 6 LRR (leucine-rich) repeats.
