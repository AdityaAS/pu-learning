AC   Q8KBJ9;
Aminomethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.10) (Glycine cleavage system T
protein).
"The complete genome sequence of Chlorobium tepidum TLS, a
photosynthetic, anaerobic, green-sulfur bacterium.";
-!- FUNCTION: The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the degradation of
    glycine (By similarity).
-!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: [Protein]-8-S-aminomethyldihydrolipoyllysine +
    tetrahydrofolate = [protein]-dihydrolipoyllysine + 5,10-
    methylenetetrahydrofolate + NH(3).
-!- SUBUNIT: The glycine cleavage system is composed of four proteins:
    P, T, L and H (By similarity).
-!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the gcvT family.
 GO:0019464; P:glycine decarboxylation via glycine cleavag...; IEA:HAMAP.
